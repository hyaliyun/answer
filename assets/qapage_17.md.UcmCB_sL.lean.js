Reruns of the series proved to be wildly successful in syndication during the 1970s, which persuaded the series' then-owner, Paramount Pictures, to expand the franchise.\\r\\nParamount originally began work on a Star Trek feature film in 1975 after lobbying by the creator of the franchise, Gene Roddenberry. The studio scrapped the project two years later in favor of creating a television series, Star Trek: Phase II, with the original cast. However, following the huge success of Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind in 1977, Paramount changed its mind again, halting production on the television series and adapting its pilot episode into a Star Trek feature film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). Five more Star Trek feature films featuring the entire original cast followed. The cast of the 1987ÿ1994 Star Trek spin-off series Star Trek: The Next Generation starred in a further four films. Upon the release of Star Trek: Nemesis on December 13, 2002, the film had grossed $67 million, a meager amount compared to the box office of previous installments. Due to the film's poor reception and box office disappointment, the series was put on a hiatus until the franchise was rebooted with a new film, directed by J. J. Abrams and released on May 8, 2009, simply titled Star Trek, serving as a reboot to the franchise with a new cast portraying younger versions of the original series' characters. A sequel to Star Trek (2009), Star Trek Into Darkness, was released in theaters on May 16, 2013. A third film, Star Trek Beyond, was released on July 22, 2016, on the franchise's 50th anniversary.\\r\\nThe Star Trek films have received 15 Academy Award nominations. Star Trek (2009) won for Best Makeup in 2010, and four of the previous films were nominated mainly in the areas of makeup, music, set design and sound design.\\r\\nThe early Star Trek films, the first to tenth film, were originally released on VHS; competitive pricing of The Wrath of Khan's videocassette helped bolster the adoption of VHS players in households.[1] Later films were also released on LaserDisc as well. For those films that did not receive an initial DVD release, Paramount released simple one-disc versions with no special features. Later, the first ten films were released in two-disc collector's versions, with The Motion Picture and The Wrath of Khan branded as \\"director's cuts\\", followed by later box set releases. All of the films are now available on Blu-ray, digital download, streaming media and video on demand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStar Trek creator Gene Roddenberry first suggested the idea of a Star Trek feature in 1969.[2] When the original television series was cancelled, he lobbied to continue the franchise through a film. The success of the series in syndication convinced the studio to begin work on a feature film in 1975.[3] A series of writers attempted to craft a suitably epic script, but the attempts did not satisfy Paramount, so the studio scrapped the project in 1977. Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots with a new television series, Star Trek: Phase II. The massive worldwide box office success of Star Wars in mid-1977 sent Hollywood studios to their vaults in search of similar sci-fi properties that could be adapted or re-launched to the big screen. When Columbia's Close Encounters of the Third Kind had a huge opening in late December 1977, Paramount was convinced that science fiction films other than Star Wars could do well at the box office, and production of Phase II was cancelled in favor of making a Star Trek film.\\r\\nPrincipal photography for Star Trek: The Motion Picture commenced August 7, 1978[4] with director Robert Wise helming the feature. The production encountered difficulties and slipped behind schedule,[5] with effects team Robert Abel and Associates[6] proving unable to handle the film's large amount of effects work. Douglas Trumbull was hired and given a blank check to complete the effects work in time and location;[7] the final cut of the film was completed just in time for the film's premiere. The film introduced an upgrade to the technology and starship designs, making for a dramatic visual departure from the original series. Many of the set elements created for Phase II were adapted and enhanced for use in the first feature films. It received mixed reviews from critics; while it grossed $139 million the price tag had climbed to about $35 million due to costly effects work and delays.\\r\\nThe Motion Picture's gross was considered disappointing, but it was enough for Paramount to back a sequel with a reduced budget. After Roddenberry pitched a film in which the crew of the Enterprise goes back in time to ensure the assassination of John F. Kennedy, he was \\"kicked upstairs\\" to a ceremonial role while Paramount brought in television producer Harve Bennett to craft a betterand cheaperfilm than the first.[8] After watching all the television episodes, Bennett decided that the character of Khan Noonien Singh was the perfect villain for the new film. Director Nicholas Meyer finished a complete screenplay in just twelve days, and did everything possible within budget to give The Wrath of Khan a nautical, swashbuckling feel,[9] which he described as \\"Horatio Hornblower in outer space.\\"[8] Upon release, the reception of The Wrath of Khan was highly positive;[10] Entertainment Weekly's Mark Bernadin called The Wrath of Khan, \\"the film that, by most accounts, saved Star Trek as we know it\\".[11]\\r\\nMeyer declined to return for the next film, so directing duties were given to cast member Leonard Nimoy for the third film. Paramount gave Bennett the green light to write Star Trek III the day after The Wrath of Khan opened.[12] The producer penned a resurrection story for Spock that built on threads from the previous film and the original series episode \\"Amok Time\\".[citation needed] Nimoy remained director for the next film in the series. Nimoy and Bennett wanted a film with a lighter tone that did not have a classic antagonist. They decided on a time travel story with the Enterprise crew returning to their past to retrieve something to save their presenteventually, humpback whales. After having been dissatisfied with the script written by Daniel Petrie, Jr., Paramount hired Meyer to rewrite the screenplay with Bennett's help. Meyer drew upon his own time travel story Time After Time for elements[which?] of the script.[citation needed] Star William Shatner was promised his turn as director for Star Trek V, and Nicholas Meyer returned as director/co-writer for Star Trek VI.\\r\\nBoth the sixth and seventh films acted as transitions between the films featuring the original cast and those with the Next Generation cast, with the sixth focusing on the original cast and the seventh focusing on the TNG cast. The Next Generation cast made four films over a period of eight years, with the last two performing only moderately well (Insurrection) and disappointingly (Nemesis) at the box office.\\r\\nAfter the poor reception of Star Trek: Nemesis and the cancellation of the television series Star Trek: Enterprise, the franchise's executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen began developing a new film,[13] entitled Star Trek: The Beginning, which would take place after Enterprise but before The Original Series.[14] J. J. Abrams, the producer of Cloverfield and creator of Lost, was a Star Wars fan as a child and confessed that the Star Trek franchise felt \\"disconnected\\" for him.[15] In February 2007, Abrams accepted Paramount's offer to direct the new Star Trek film, having been previously attached as producer.[16] Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman wrote a script that impressed Abrams, featuring new actors portraying younger versions of the original series' cast. The Enterprise, its interior, and the original uniforms were redesigned. While the film was ready for a December 2008 release, Paramount chose to move the film's opening to May 8, 2009.[17] The film earned over $350 million worldwide (from a solid $75.2 million opening weekend, higher than Star Trek: First Contact (1996)), and surpassed Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home as the highest-grossing film in the franchise. A sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, was greenlighted even before the first one opened, and Paramount released the film on May 17, 2013.[18] A third film, Star Trek Beyond, was directed by Justin Lin and produced by Abrams. It was released on July 22, 2016, also to critical acclaim.\\r\\nThis revival of the franchise is often considered to be, and referred to as, a \\"reboot\\", but it is technically a continuation of the franchise (Nimoy reprises his role of Spock from the previous films) that establishes an alternate reality from the previous films. This route was taken, over a traditional reboot, to free the new films from the restrictions of established continuity without completely discarding it, which the writers felt would have been \\"disrespectful\\". This new reality was informally referred to by several names, including the \\"Abramsverse\\", \\"JJ Trek\\", and \\"NuTrek\\", before it was named the \\"Kelvin Timeline\\" (versus the \\"Prime Timeline\\" of the original series and films) by Michael and Denise Okuda for use in official Star Trek reference guides and encyclopedias. The name Kelvin comes from the USS Kelvin, a starship involved in the event that creates the new reality in Star Trek (2009). Abrams named the starship after his grandfather Henry Kelvin, whom he also pays tribute to in Into Darkness with the Kelvin Memorial Archive.[19][20]\\r\\nFans commonly considered the films to follow a \\"curse\\" that even-numbered films were better than the odd-numbered installments.[21][22] The tenth film, Nemesis, was considered the even film that defied the curse.[21][23][24] Its failure and the subsequent success of Star Trek (2009) were considered to have broken the trend.[25][26] The curse has been mentioned often in popular culture. One of the best known examples[27][28] occurred in a 1999 episode of the Channel 4 sitcom Spaced, where it was referenced by Tim Bisley, played by Simon Pegg; Pegg, quite conscious of the irony,[29] played Scotty in the eleventh and subsequent films.\\r\\nA massive energy cloud advances toward Earth, leaving destruction in its wake, and the Enterprise must intercept it to determine what lies within, and what its intent might be.\\r\\nThe movie borrows many elements from \\"The Changeling\\" of the original series and \\"One of Our Planets Is Missing\\" from the animated series.\\r\\nKhan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalbn), whom Kirk thwarted in his attempt to seize control of the Enterprise fifteen years earlier (\\"Space Seed\\"), seeks his revenge and lays a cunning and sinister trap.\\r\\nBoth the first and second films have television versions with additional footage and alternate takes that affect the storyline. (Subsequent Trek films tended to have shorter television versions.) Especially notable in The Wrath of Khan is the footage establishing that a young crew member who acts courageously and dies during an attack on the Enterprise is Scotty's nephew.\\r\\nWhen McCoy begins acting irrationally, Kirk learns that Spock, in his final moments, transferred his katra, his living spirit, to the doctor. To save McCoy from emotional ruin, Kirk and crew steal the Enterprise and violate the quarantine of the Genesis Planet to retrieve Spock, his body regenerated by the rapidly dying planet itself, in the hope that body and soul can be rejoined. However, bent on obtaining the secret of Genesis for themselves, a rogue Klingon (Christopher Lloyd) and his crew interfere, with deadly consequences.\\r\\nThe first film to be a direct sequel to the previous Trek film.\\r\\nWhile returning to stand court-martial for their actions in rescuing Spock, Kirk and crew learn that Earth is under siege by a giant probe that is transmitting a destructive signal, attempting to communicate with the now-extinct species of humpback whales. To save the planet, the crew must time-travel back to the late 20th century to obtain a mating pair of these whales, and a marine biologist (Catherine Hicks) to care for them.\\r\\nThe second through fourth films loosely form a trilogy, with the later plots building on elements of the earlier ones. The third film picks up within several days of the conclusion of the second, the fourth three months after the third. (The fifth film takes place a month after the fourth, but is not directly connected to the plots of the preceding three films.) The third and fourth films were both directed by Leonard Nimoy (also co-writer of the fourth), best known as the actor playing Spock.\\r\\nSpock's half-brother (Laurence Luckinbill) believes he is summoned by God, and hijacks the brand-new (and problem-ridden) Enterprise-A to take it through the Great Barrier, at the center of the Milky Way, beyond which he believes his maker waits for him. Meanwhile, a young and vain Klingon captain (Todd Bryant), seeking glory in what he views as an opportunity to avenge his people of the deaths of their crewmen on Genesis, sets his sights on Kirk.\\r\\nThis is the only film in the franchise directed by William Shatner.\\r\\nWhen Qo'noS' moon Praxis (the Klingon Empire's chief energy source) is devastated by an explosion caused by overmining, the Klingons make peace overtures to the Federation. The Klingon Chancellor (David Warner), while en route to Earth for a summit, is assassinated by Enterprise crewmen, and Kirk is held accountable by the Chancellor's Chief of Staff (Christopher Plummer). Spock attempts to prove Kirk's innocence, but, in doing so, uncovers a massive conspiracy against the peace process with participants from both sides.\\r\\nThis film is a sendoff to the original crew. One Next Generation cast member, Michael Dorn, appears as the grandfather of the character he plays on the later television series. It is the second and last Trek film directed by Nicholas Meyer and last script co-authored by Leonard Nimoy.\\r\\nPicard enlists the help of Kirk, who is presumed long dead but flourishes in an extradimensional realm, to keep a madman (Malcolm McDowell) from destroying a star and its populated planetary system in an attempt to enter that realm.\\r\\nFollowing seven seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the next Star Trek film was the first to feature the crew of the Enterprise-D along with a long prologue sequence featuring three members of the original cast.\\r\\nAfter a failed attempt to assault Earth, the Borg attempt to prevent First Contact between Humans and Vulcans by interfering with Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) warp test in the past. Picard must confront the demons which stem from his assimilation into the Collective (\\"The Best of Both Worlds\\") as he leads the Enterprise-E back through time to ensure the test and subsequent meeting with the Vulcans take place.\\r\\nThe first of two films directed by series actor Jonathan Frakes.\\r\\nProfoundly disturbed by what he views as a blatant violation of the Prime Directive, Picard deliberately interferes with a Starfleet admiral's (Anthony Zerbe) plan to relocate a relatively small but seemingly immortal population from a planet to gain control of the planet's natural radiation, which has been discovered to have substantial medicinal properties. However, the admiral himself is a pawn in his alien partner's (F. Murray Abraham) mission of vengeance.\\r\\nA clone of Picard (Tom Hardy), created by the Romulans but eventually exiled to hard labor on Remus, assassinates the entire Romulan senate, assumes dictatorship, and lures Picard and the Enterprise to Romulus under the false pretence of a peace overture.\\r\\nThis film was a critical and commercial disappointment (released December 13, 2002 in direct competition with the James Bond film Die Another Day and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers) and was the final Star Trek film to feature the Next Generation cast and to be produced by Rick Berman.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Vulcan is destroyed by Romulans from the future, Starfleet cadet Kirk (Chris Pine) and instructor Spock (Zachary Quinto) must set aside their differences to keep Earth from suffering the same fate.\\r\\nThis film acts as a reboot to the existing franchise by taking place in an \\"alternate reality\\" using the plot device of time travel to depict an altered timeline (known as the Kelvin Timeline), featuring younger versions of the original series' cast. It is the first production to feature an entirely different cast of actors playing roles previously established by other actors, with the exception of an aged Spock played by Leonard Nimoy. It was directed by J. J. Abrams (who produced it with Damon Lindelof) and written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. According to Lindelof, this production was designed to attract a wider audience.[30] It received positive reviews[31] and a number of awards, including the film franchise's only Academy Award, for \\"makeup and hairstyling\\".\\r\\nA Starfleet special agent (Benedict Cumberbatch) coerces an officer into blowing up a secret installation in London, shoots up a subsequent meeting of Starfleet brass in San Francisco, and then flees to Qo'noS. The crew of the Enterprise attempt to bring him to justice without provoking war with the Klingon Empire, but find there is much more to the agent's mission, and the man himself, than what the Fleet Admiral (Peter Weller) has told them.\\r\\nThe Enterprise is ambushed and destroyed by countless alien microvessels; the crew abandon ship. Stranded on an unknown planet, and with no apparent means of escape or rescue, they find themselves in conflict with a new sociopathic enemy (Idris Elba) who has a well-earned hatred of the Federation and what it stands for.\\r\\nStar Trek Beyond was released on July 22, 2016, in time for the franchise's 50th anniversary celebrations. Roberto Orci had stated that Star Trek Beyond will feel more like the original series than its predecessors in the reboot series while still trying something new with the established material.[32] In December 2014, Justin Lin was confirmed as the director for the upcoming sequel,[33] marking the first reboot film not to be directed by J. J. Abrams, whose commitments to Star Wars: The Force Awakens restricted his role on the Star Trek film to that of producer.[34] In January 2015, it was confirmed that the film would be co-written by Doug Jung and Simon Pegg,[35] who revealed the film's title that May.[36] Idris Elba was cast as the villain Krall,[37][38] while Sofia Boutella was cast as Jaylah.[39] Filming began on June 25, 2015.[40] This is the last film of Anton Yelchin (Chekov), who died in an automobile accident on June 19, 2016.\\r\\nPine and Quinto have signed contracts to return as Kirk and Spock for a fourth film.[41] In July 2016, Abrams confirmed plans for a fourth film, and stated that Chris Hemsworth would return as Kirk's father, George, whom he played in the prologue of the first film.[42][43] Later that month, Paramount confirmed the return of Hemsworth as well as most of the Beyond cast, producers Abrams and Lindsey Weber, and writers J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay.[44] That same month, Abrams had said that Chekov would not be recast, after Anton Yelchin died in a motor vehicle incident.[45] In December 2017, Deadline.com reported that Quentin Tarantino is currently working on the next Star Trek theatrical installment with Abrams, with the intention being that the former will direct the film.[46] Mark L. Smith, Lindsey Beer, Megan Amram and Drew Pearce took part in the writers room before Paramount finalized a deal with Smith to write the script.[47]\\r\\nThe following table shows the cast members who played the primary characters in the film series.","input":"When was the last star trek movie released?"},{"output":"1950s","context":"","input":"When did colorado a m become colorado state?"},{"output":"the Rickenbacker company","context":"A solid-body musical instrument is a string instrument such as a guitar, bass or violin built without its normal sound box and relying on an electric pickup system to directly receive the vibrations of the strings.\\r\\nSolid-body instruments are preferred in situations where acoustic feedback may otherwise be a problem and are inherently both less expensive to build and more rugged than acoustic electric instruments.\\r\\nThe most well-known solid body instruments are the electric guitar and electric bass. These were instrumental in creating new genres of music such as rock and heavy metal. Common woods used in the construction of solid body instruments are ash, alder, maple, mahogany, korina, spruce, rosewood, and ebony. The first two make up the majority of solid body electric guitars.\\r\\nSolid body instruments have some of the same features as acoustic string instruments. Like a typical string instrument they have a neck with tuners for the strings, a bridge and a fingerboard (or fretboard). The fretboard is a piece of wood placed on the top surface of the neck, extending from the head to the body. The strings run above the fingerboard. Some fingerboards have frets or bars which the strings are pressed against. This allows musicians to stop the string in the same place. Ebony, rosewood and maple are commonly used to make the fingerboard. Some electric guitar necks do not have a separate piece of wood for the fingerboard surface. All the solid bodies have variations in scale length or, the length of the strings from the nut to the bridge. The action, or the height of the strings from the fingerboard, is adjustable on solid body instruments. Most solid bodies have controls for volume and tone. Some have an electronic preamplifier with equalization for low, middle, and high frequencies. These are used to shape the sound along with the aid of the main amplifier. Amplifiers allow solid body instruments to be heard at high volumes when desired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSolid-body instruments?:\\r\\nSolid-body instruments do not include?:\\r\\nElectric lap steel guitars without sounding boards are considered to be solid-body instruments by some authorities, and not by others. This has a major effect on some claims of historical priority, as they predate the first models of solid-body electric guitar, which may otherwise be claimed to be the first commercially successful solid-body instruments. While noting this, it will be assumed that electric lap steels without sounding boards are solid-body instruments for the purposes of this article.\\r\\nThe first commercially successful solid-body instrument was the Rickenbacker frying pan lap steel guitar, produced from 1931 to 1939. The first commercially available non lap steel guitar was also produced by the Rickenbacker/Electro company, starting in 1931 The model was referred to as the \\"electric Spanish Guitar\\" to distinguish it from the \\"Hawaiian\\" lap steel.\\r\\nThe first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar was the Fender Broadcaster in 1950. A trademark dispute with the Gretsch Corporation who marketed a line of Broadcaster drums led to a name change to the current designation, Fender Telecaster in 1951 (Transition instruments produced between the two model names had no model name on the head stock and are now referred to as 'No Casters\\"). Fender also produced a one pickup version called the Fender Esquire starting in 1950. These were followed by the Gibson Les Paul in 1952.\\r\\nThe solid body electric guitar is one of the most well-known solid body instruments. Instrumental in rock, metal, blues, and country music, the electric guitar has been responsible for creating various sounds.\\r\\nThere are some common characteristics of solid body electric guitars. They typically have six strings although there are some seven- and eight-string models. Most have at least a volume and tone control. If they have more than one guitar pickup they have a switch that allows them to switch between the different pickups. There are various types of pickups that can be outfitted to a guitar. They can have single-coils, a P-90, or a humbucker. These pickups can be either passive or active (require batteries).\\r\\nSometimes guitars are outfitted with pick guards which prevent the guitar from being scratched by a guitar pick.\\r\\nThe origins of the solid body electric guitar are confusing. The first commercially available solid body electric Spanish guitar was produced by the Rickenbacker company in 1931. Les Paul, a guitarist, is often erroneously credited with inventing the first solid body, but Fender is often incorrectly credited as the first to commercially market a solid body electric guitar, which itself was based on a design by Merle Travis. Also it is reported that around the same time (1940) a solid body was created by Jamaican musician and inventor, Hedley Jones. In the 1940s, Les Paul created a guitar called the Log, which came from the 4 by 4 solid block of pine which the guitarist had inserted between the sawed halves of the body that hed just dismembered. He then carefully re-joined the neck to the pine log, using some metal brackets. [1] He then put some pickups that he designed on it. He soon went to companies asking if they would buy his guitar. They turned him down. However, after the Fender Telecaster electric guitar became popular, the Gibson company contacted him and had him endorse a model named after him, The Les Paul guitar. It came out in 1952.\\r\\nWhile Les Paul was looking for a manufacture for his log, Leo Fender was working on the Fender Telecaster. It was released in 1950. The telecaster had a basic, single-cutaway solid slab of ash for a body and separate screwed-on maple neck was geared to mass production. It had a slanted pickup mounted into a steel bridge-plate carrying three adjustable bridge-saddles. [2] Its color was blond. It is considered the worlds first commercially marketed solid body electric guitar. .[2] The Telecaster continues to be manufactured today.\\r\\nThe follow-up to the Telecaster, the Stratocaster, appeared in 1954. It had three pickups instead of two. It had a vibrato bar on the bridge. This allowed players to bend notes. The contoured body with its beveled corners reduced the chafing on the players body.[3] It also had cutaway above and below the fretboard to allow players easy access to the top frets.\\r\\nIn 1958, Gibson introduced the Explorer and the Flying V. Only about 100 Explorers were produced. Very few of the Flying V were produced either. Both were discontinued shortly after. The Flying V did manage to find a few followers and Gibson reintroduced the guitar in 1967. The Explorer was also reintroduced, in the mid-1970s. Both guitars are still in production today.\\r\\nIn 1961, Gibson discontinued the Les Paul model and replaced it with a new design. The result was the Solid Guitar (SG). It weighed less and was less dense than the Les Paul. It had double cutaways to allow easier access to the top frets. Eventually the Les Paul was put back into production in 1968 because Blues and Hard Rock guitarists liked the sound of the Les Pauls. The SG and the Les Paul are still in production today.\\r\\nFender and Gibson went on to make more well-known models. Gibson made the Melody Maker and the Firebird. Fender later created the Jazzmaster, and Jaguar.\\r\\nSome of the designs that Gibson and Fender created provide the basis for many guitars made by various manufacturers today.\\r\\nA typical solid body bass guitar has specific characteristics. It usually consists of four strings (some have been made with more), a 34 scale neck, at least one pickup, sometimes a pickguard, frets, and a bridge. It also has a volume and tone control. Some solid body basses have a three-band equalizer to stabilize the low frequency of the bass. Woods typically used to make the body of the bass are alder, maple, or mahogany. Rosewood or ebony are used for to make the fingerboard. The pickups are of the same style as used for guitars except they are designed for basses.\\r\\nThe double bass guitar was very heavy and not as easy to carry as other string instruments. Paul Tutmarc built an electronic bass that was played the same way as a guitar. This bass was called the Audiovox Model 736 Electronic Bass. About 100 Audiovox 736 basses were made, and their distribution was apparently limited to the Seattle area.[4]:29 The idea did not catch on and the company folded.\\r\\nIn the late 1940s when dance bands downsized,[4]:31 guitar players who lost their positions playing guitar were told they could play double bass. However, they did not want to take the time to learn upright technique. They needed a bass they could play like a guitar-a fretted bass.[4]:31 Leo Fender heard these criticisms and took his telecaster model and adopted it to a bass guitar. The result was the Fender Precision Bass. It consisted of an ash bolt-on maple neck. The scale for the bass was 34. It also had cutaways for better balance.[4]:33 Now guitarists could double on bass, and the bass player of the band would not have to carry around a huge upright bass. It entered the market in 1951.\\r\\nFenders second bass model, the Jazz Bass, was introduced in 1959. It had a slimmer neck at the nut, a different two pickup combination, and an offset body shape. While it did not become extremely popular among jazz players, it was well received in rock music.\\r\\nMany companies today produced models based on the body shapes first started by Fender.\\r\\nGibson created the Gibson Electric Bass to be introduced in the 1953. The scale, 30 ? was shorter than the Fender basses. Its body was designed to look like a violin. It had a single pickup. It also had an endpin which allowed the bass player to play it vertically. In 1959 Gibson created the EB-0 which was designed to complement the Les Paul Junior. In 1961 it was redesigned to match the SG guitar and the EB-) designation was retained. A two pickup version was later introduced called the EB-3 and a long scale variant was made called the EB-3L.\\r\\nGibson also created the Thunderbird in 1963, which complemented the Firebird. It had the 34 scale for the neck. This was the same scale as the Fender basses.\\r\\nOther companies have created designs that are different from the Fender and Gibson models.\\r\\nElectric mandolins are similar to electric violins because they traditionally have one pickup. Some manufacturers produce electric violins because they also have a single pickup.\\r\\nEpiphone currently produces an electric mandolin called the Mandobird IV and VIII, IV and VIII standing for four and eight strings respectively.[5][6]\\r\\nThey usually have a bolt on neck and a rosewood inlay. Both Mandobird models have a single coil pickup.\\r\\nThe solid body electric violin is different from the traditional violin because it does not have a hollow body and has a Piezo Pickup with Passive Volume and Tone Controls. [7] These features allow it to be amplified. The body is made of wood, usually maple. The fingerboard is made out of ebony. The top of the violin might be made out of flame maple or solid spruce. The body of the electric violin compared to an acoustic violin has cutaways that allow for weight reduction and a lighter body.\\r\\nWhile a regular sitar has 21, 22, or 23 strings an electric sitar is designed similar to a guitar. It first appeared in 1967 when Vinnie Bell invented the Coral electric sitar, a small six-string guitar-like instrument producing a twangy sound that reminded people of its Indian namesake. [8] It is played like a regular guitar. An electric sitars electronics consist of Three pickups with individual volume and tone controls are standard, including one pickup over the sympathetic strings. The bridge of the electric sitar is creates the sound of a sitar. Like electric guitars, made by Fender especially, the neck of a sitar is usually made of bolt-on, hard maple wood with an optional mini-harp. The sitar also has 13 drone strings located above the six strings that reach from the fretboard to the bridge.\\r\\nElectric violas are designed similar to electric violins. They usually have the same features.\\r\\nElectric cellos are similar to regular cellos, but they have a smaller body. Some electric cellos have no body branching out from the middle where the strings are. Some electric cellos have the out line of the traditional body around the middle, creating the feel of a traditional cello. It is played like a traditional cello.\\r\\nThe electric cello contains a volume control. Some have eq controls also. The fingerboard is made out of ebony. A piezo pickup is mounted at the bridge for amplification.\\r\\nThe body can be made out of alder.","input":"Who created the first solid body electric guitar?"},{"output":"Amado Carrillo Fuentes","context":"Amado Carrillo Fuentes (/fu??nt?s/; December 17, 1956 ÿ July 4, 1997) was a Mexican drug lord who seized control of the Jurez Cartel after assassinating his boss Rafael Aguilar Guajardo.[1][2] Amado Carrillo became known as \\"El Se?or de Los Cielos\\" (\\"The Lord of the Skies\\"), because of the large fleet of jets he used to transport drugs. He was also known for laundering money via Colombia to finance his large fleet of airplanes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe died in July 1997, in a Mexican hospital, after undergoing extensive plastic surgery to change his appearance.[3][4][5] In his final days Carrillo was being tracked by Mexican and U.S. authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrillo was born to Walter Vicente Carrillo Vega and Aurora Fuentes in Guamuchilito, Navolato, Sinaloa, Mexico. He was the first of seven sons; the others were: Cipriano, Enrique B., Vicente, Jos Cruz, Enrique C., and Jorge. He also had five sisters: Mara Luisa, Berthila, Flor, Alicia, and Aurora.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese children were the nieces and nephews of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, a/k/a \\"Don Neto\\", the Guadalajara Cartel leader.  Amado got his start in the drug business under the tutelage of his uncle Ernesto and later brought in his brothers, and eventually his son Vicente Jos Carrillo Leyva.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrillo's father died in April 1986. Carillo's brother, Cipriano Carrillo Fuentes, died in 1989 under mysterious circumstances.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, Carrillo was part of the Guadalajara Cartel, sent to Ojinaga, Chihuahua to oversee the cocaine shipments of his uncle, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo (\\"Don Neto\\"), and to learn about border operations from Pablo Acosta Villarreal (\\"El Zorro de Ojinaga\\"; \\"The Ojinaga Fox\\") and Rafael Aguilar Guajardo. Later Carrillo worked with Pablo Escobar and the Cali Cartel smuggling drugs from Colombia to Mexico and the United States. He worked with El Chapo Joaquin Guzman Loera, The Arellano Felix family and The Beltran Leyva Organization.[6][7] During his tenure, Carrillo reportedly built a multibillion-dollar drug empire. It was estimated that he may have made over US$25 billion in revenue in his career.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pressure to capture Carrillo intensified among U.S. and Mexican authorities,[when?][why?] and perhaps for this reason, Carrillo underwent facial plastic surgery and abdominal liposuction to change his appearance on July 4, 1997, at Santa M܇nica Hospital in Mexico City. However, during the operation, he died of complications apparently caused either by a medication or a malfunctioning respirator. Two of Carrillo's bodyguards were in the operating room during the procedure. On November 7, 1997, the two physicians who performed the surgery on Fuentes were found dead, encased in concrete inside steel drums, with their bodies showing signs of torture.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the night of August 3, 1997, at around 9:30?p.m., four drug traffickers walked into a restaurant in Ciudad Jurez, pulled out their guns, and opened fire on five diners, killing them instantly.[10] Police estimated that more than 100 bullet casings were found at the crime scene. According to a report issued by the Los Angeles Times, four men went to the restaurant carrying at least two AK-47 assault rifles while others stood at the doorstep.[10][11] On their way out, the gunmen claimed another victim:[12] Armando Olague, a prison official and off-duty law enforcement officer, who was gunned down outside the restaurant after he had walked from a nearby bar to investigate the shooting. Reportedly, Olague had run into the restaurant from across the street with a gun in his hand to check out the commotion. It was later determined that Olague was also a known lieutenant of the Juarez cartel.[12] Mexican authorities declined to comment on the motives behind the killing, stating the shootout was not linked to the death of Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Nonetheless, it was later stated that the perpetrators were gunmen of the Tijuana Cartel.[10][13] Although confrontations between narcotraficantes were commonplace in Ciudad Jurez, they rarely occurred in public places. What happened in the restaurant threatened to usher in a new era of border crime in the city.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ciudad Jurez, the PGR seized warehouses they believed the cartel used to store weapons and cocaine; they also seized over 60 properties all over Mexico belonging to Carrillo, and began an investigation into his dealings with police and government officials. Officials also froze bank accounts amounting to $10 billion belonging to Carrillo.[14]  In April 2009, Mexican authorities arrested Carillo's son, Vicente Carrillo Leyva.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrillo was given a large and expensive funeral in Guamuchilito, Sinaloa. In 2006, Governor Eduardo Bours asked the federal government to tear down Carrillo's mansion in Hermosillo, Sonora.[16] The mansion, dubbed \\"The Palace of a Thousand and One Nights\\", although still standing, remains unoccupied.[citation needed]","input":"Who is el senor de los cielos based on?"},{"output":"Samuel Slater","context":"Samuel Slater (June 9, 1768 ÿ April 21, 1835) was an early English-American industrialist known as the \\"Father of the American Industrial Revolution\\" (a phrase coined by Andrew Jackson) and the \\"Father of the American Factory System\\". In the UK, he was called \\"Slater the Traitor\\"[2] because he brought British textile technology to America, modifying it for United States use. He memorized the designs of textile factory machinery as an apprentice to a pioneer in the British industry before migrating to the United States at the age of 21. He designed the first textile mills in the US and later went into business for himself, developing a family business with his sons. A wealthy man, he eventually owned thirteen spinning mills and had developed tenant farms and company towns around his textile mills, such as Slatersville, Rhode Island.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSamuel Slater was born in Belper, Derbyshire, England, on June 9, 1768, the fifth son of a farming family of eight children. He received a basic education at a school run by a Mrs. Martinez Jr.[2] At age ten, he began work at the cotton mill opened that year by Jedediah Strutt using the water frame pioneered by Richard Arkwright at nearby Cromford Mill. In 1782, his father died and his family indentured Samuel as an apprentice to Strutt.[3] Slater was well trained by Strutt and, by age 21, he had gained a thorough knowledge of the organisation and practice of cotton spinning.\\r\\nHe learned of the American interest in developing similar machines, and he was also aware of British laws against exporting the designs. He therefore memorized as much as he could and departed for New York in 1789. Some people of Belper called him \\"Slater the Traitor\\", as they considered his move a betrayal of the town where many earned their living at Strutt's mills.[4]\\r\\nIn 1789, leading Rhode Island industrialist Moses Brown moved to Pawtucket, Rhode Island to operate a mill in partnership with his son-in-law William Almy and cousin Smith Brown.[2] Almy & Brown, as the company was to be called, was housed in a former fulling mill near the Pawtucket Falls of the Blackstone River. They planned to manufacture cloth for sale, with yarn to be spun on spinning wheels, jennies, and frames, using water power. In August, they acquired a 32-spindle frame \\"after the Arkwright pattern,\\" but could not operate it. At this point, Slater wrote to them offering his services.\\r\\nSlater realized that nothing could be done with the machinery as it stood, and convinced Brown of his knowledge. He promised: \\"If I do not make as good yarn, as they do in England, I will have nothing for my services, but will throw the whole of what I have attempted over the bridge.\\"[5] In 1790, he signed a contract with Brown to replicate the British designs. Their deal provided Slater the funds to build the water frames and associated machinery, with a half share in their capital value and the profits derived from them. By December, the shop was operational with ten to twelve workers. By 1791, Slater had some machinery in operation, despite shortages of tools and skilled mechanics. In 1793, Slater and Brown opened their first factory in Pawtucket.\\r\\nSlater knew the secret of Arkwright's successnamely, that account had to be taken of varying fibre lengthsbut he also understood Arkwright's carding, drawing, and roving machines. He also had the experience of working with all the elements as a continuous production system. During construction, Slater made some adjustments to the designs to fit local needs. The result was the first successful water-powered roller spinning textile mill in America.\\r\\nAfter developing this mill, Slater instituted principles of management which he had learned from Strutt and Arkwright to teach workers to be skilled mechanics.\\r\\nIn 1812, Slater built the Old Green Mill, later known as Cranston Print Works, in East Village in Webster, Massachusetts. He moved to Webster due in part to an available workforce, but also due to abundant water power from Webster Lake.[6]\\r\\nSlater created the \\"Rhode Island System,\\" factory practices based upon the patterns of family life in New England villages. Children aged 7 to 12 were the first employees of the mill; Slater personally supervised them closely. The first child workers were hired in 1790.[7] From his experience in Milford, it is highly unlikely that Slater resorted to physical punishment of the children, relying instead on a system of fines. Slater tried to recruit workers from other villages, but that fell through due to the close-knit framework of the New England family.[citation needed]\\r\\nHe brought in whole families, developing entire villages.[8] He provided company-owned housing nearby, along with company stores; he sponsored a Sunday School where college students taught the children reading and writing.[citation needed]\\r\\nSlater constructed a new mill in 1793 for the sole purpose of textile manufacture under the name Almy, Brown & Slater, as he was now partners with Almy and Brown. It was a 72-spindle mill; the patenting of Eli Whitney's cotton gin in 1794 reduced the labor in processing cotton. It also enabled profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton, which could be grown in the interior uplands, resulting in a dramatic expansion of cotton cultivation throughout the Deep South in the antebellum years. The New England mills and their labor force of free men depended on southern cotton, which was based on slave labor. Slater also brought the Sunday School system from his native England to his textile factory at Pawtucket.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1798, Samuel Slater split from Almy and Brown, forming Samuel Slater & Company in partnership with his father-in-law Oziel Wilkinson. They developed other mills in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire.[9]\\r\\nIn 1799, he was joined by his brother John Slater from England. John was a wheelwright who had spent time studying the latest English developments and might well have gained experience of the spinning mule.[2] Samuel put John Slater in charge of a large mill which he called the White Mill.[10]\\r\\nBy 1810, Slater held part ownership in three factories in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In 1823, he bought a mill in Connecticut. He also built factories to make the textile manufacturing machinery used by many of the region's mills, and formed a partnership with his brother-in-law to produce iron for use in machinery construction. But Slater spread himself too thin, and was unable to coordinate or integrate his many different business interests. He refused to go outside his family to hire managers and, after 1829, he made his sons partners in the new umbrella firm of Samuel Slater and Sons. His son Horatio Nelson Slater completely reorganized the family business, introduced cost-cutting measures and giving up old-fashioned procedures. Slater & Company became one of the leading manufacturing companies in the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nSlater also hired recruiters to search for families willing to work at the mill. He advertised to attract more families for the mills.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy 1800, the success of the Slater mill had been duplicated by other entrepreneurs. By 1810, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin reported that the U.S. had some 50 cotton-yarn mills, many of them started in response to the Embargo of 1807 that cut off imports from Britain prior to the War of 1812. That war resulted in speeding up the process of industrialization in New England. By war's end in 1815, there were 140 cotton manufacturers within 30 miles of Providence, employing 26,000 hands and operating 130,000 spindles. The American textile industry was launched.\\r\\nIn 1791, Samuel Slater married Hannah Wilkinson; she invented two-ply thread, becoming in 1793 the first American woman to be granted a patent.[11] Samuel and Hannah had ten children together, although four died during infancy. Hannah Slater died in 1812 from complications of childbirth, leaving Samuel Slater with six young children to raise.[12] Along with his brothers, Samuel started the Slater family in America.\\r\\nSlater married for a second time in 1817, to a widow, Esther Parkinson. As his business was extremely successful by this time, and as Parkinson also owned property prior to their marriage, the couple had a pre-nuptial agreement prepared.[12]\\r\\nSlater died on April 21, 1835, in Webster, Massachusetts, a town which he had founded in 1832 and named for his friend Senator Daniel Webster. At the time of his death, he owned thirteen mills and was worth one million dollars.\\r\\nSlater's original mill still stands, known today as Slater Mill and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is operated as a museum dedicated to preserving the history of Samuel Slater and his contribution to American industry. Slater's original mill in Pawtucket and the town of Slatersville are both part of the Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park, which was created to preserve and interpret the history of the industrial development of the region.\\r\\nHis papers are held at the Harvard Business School's Baker Library.[13]","input":"Who built the first textile mill in america?"},{"output":"Clearing habitats for agriculture","context":"Habitat destruction is the process in which natural habitat is rendered unable to support the species present. In this process, the organisms that previously used the site are displaced or destroyed, reducing biodiversity.[1] Habitat destruction by human activity is mainly for the purpose of harvesting natural resources for industrial production and urbanization. Clearing habitats for agriculture is the principal cause of habitat destruction. Other important causes of habitat destruction include mining, logging, trawling and urban sprawl. Habitat destruction is currently ranked as the primary cause of species extinction worldwide.[2] It is a process of natural environmental change that may be caused by habitat fragmentation, geological processes, climate change[1] or by human activities such as the introduction of invasive species, ecosystem nutrient depletion, and other human activities.\\r\\nThe terms habitat loss and habitat reduction are also used in a wider sense, including loss of habitat from other factors, such as water and noise pollution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the simplest term, when a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other organisms that occupied the habitat have a reduced carrying capacity so that populations decline and extinction becomes more likely.[3] Perhaps the greatest threat to organisms and biodiversity is the process of habitat loss.[4] Temple (1986) found that 82% of endangered bird species were significantly threatened by habitat loss. Most amphibian species are also threatened by habitat loss[5], and some species are now only breeding in modified habitat[6]. Endemic organisms with limited ranges are most affected by habitat destruction, mainly because these organisms are not found anywhere else within the world and thus, have less chance of recovering. Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem, resulting in their extinction. Extinction may also take place very long after the destruction of habitat, a phenomenon known as extinction debt. Habitat destruction can also decrease the range of certain organism populations. This can result in the reduction of genetic diversity and perhaps the production of infertile youths, as these organisms would have a higher possibility of mating with related organisms within their population, or different species. One of the most famous examples is the impact upon China's giant panda, once found across the nation. Now it is only found in fragmented and isolated regions in the southwest of the country, as a result of widespread deforestation in the 20th century.[7]\\r\\nBiodiversity hotspots are chiefly tropical regions that feature high concentrations of endemic species and, when all hotspots are combined, may contain over half of the worlds terrestrial species.[9] These hotspots are suffering from habitat loss and destruction. Most of the natural habitat on islands and in areas of high human population density has already been destroyed (WRI, 2003). Islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include New Zealand, Madagascar, the Philippines, and Japan.[10] South and East Asia  especially China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Japan  and many areas in West Africa have extremely dense human populations that allow little room for natural habitat. Marine areas close to highly populated coastal cities also face degradation of their coral reefs or other marine habitat. These areas include the eastern coasts of Asia and Africa, northern coasts of South America, and the Caribbean Sea and its associated islands.[10]\\r\\nRegions of unsustainable agriculture or unstable governments, which may go hand-in-hand, typically experience high rates of habitat destruction. Central America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Amazonian tropical rainforest areas of South America are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices and/or government mismanagement.[10]\\r\\nAreas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction. In the U.S., less than 25% of native vegetation remains in many parts of the East and Midwest.[11] Only 15% of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of Europe.[10]\\r\\nTropical rainforests have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat. From the approximately 16 million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide, less than 9 million square kilometers remain today.[10] The current rate of deforestation is 160,000 square kilometers per year, which equates to a loss of approximately 1% of original forest habitat each year.[12]\\r\\nOther forest ecosystems have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical rainforests. Farming and logging have severely disturbed at least 94% of temperate broadleaf forests; many old growth forest stands have lost more than 98% of their previous area because of human activities.[10] Tropical deciduous dry forests are easier to clear and burn and are more suitable for agriculture and cattle ranching than tropical rainforests; consequently, less than 0.1% of dry forests in Central America's Pacific Coast and less than 8% in Madagascar remain from their original extents.[12]\\r\\nPlains and desert areas have been degraded to a lesser extent. Only 10-20% of the world's drylands, which include temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, scrub, and deciduous forests, have been somewhat degraded.[13] But included in that 10-20% of land is the approximately 9 million square kilometers of seasonally dry-lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification.[10] The tallgrass prairies of North America, on the other hand, have less than 3% of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland.[14]\\r\\nWetlands and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction. More than 50% of wetlands in the U.S. have been destroyed in just the last 200 years.[11] Between 60% and 70% of European wetlands have been completely destroyed.[15] In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in demand for coastal housing and tourism which has caused a decline in marine habitats over the last 60 years. The rising sea levels and temperatures has caused soil erosion, coastal flooding, and loss of quality in the UK marine ecosystem[16]. About one-fifth (20%) of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans.[17] One-fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed, and another fifth has been severely degraded by overfishing, pollution, and invasive species; 90% of the Philippines coral reefs alone have been destroyed.[18] Finally, over 35% mangrove ecosystems worldwide have been destroyed.[18]\\r\\nHabitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism, fire, and climate change is well documented in the fossil record.[1] One study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.[1]\\r\\nHabitat destruction caused by humans includes land conversion from forests, etc. to arable land, urban sprawl, infrastructure development, and other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land. Habitat degradation, fragmentation, and pollution are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat, yet result in habitat collapse. Desertification, deforestation, and coral reef degradation are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas (deserts, forests, coral reefs).\\r\\nGeist and Lambin (2002) assessed 152 case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation. Their results, yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor, provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant. The proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of agricultural expansion (96%), infrastructure expansion (72%), and wood extraction (67%). Therefore, according to this study, forest conversion to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation. The specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation: transport extension (64%), commercial wood extraction (52%), permanent cultivation (48%), cattle ranching (46%), shifting (slash and burn) cultivation (41%), subsistence agriculture (40%), and fuel wood extraction for domestic use (28%). One result is that shifting cultivation is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions, while transport extension (including the construction of new roads) is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation.[19]\\r\\nRising global temperatures, caused by the greenhouse effect, contribute to habitat destruction, endangering various species, such as the polar bear.[20] Melting ice caps promote rising sea levels and floods which threaten natural habitats and species globally.[21][22]\\r\\nWhile the above-mentioned activities are the proximal or direct causes of habitat destruction in that they actually destroy habitat, this still does not identify why humans destroy habitat. The forces that cause humans to destroy habitat are known as drivers of habitat destruction. Demographic, economic, sociopolitical, scientific and technological, and cultural drivers all contribute to habitat destruction.[18]\\r\\nDemographic drivers include the expanding human population; rate of population increase over time; spatial distribution of people in a given area (urban versus rural), ecosystem type, and country; and the combined effects of poverty, age, family planning, gender, and education status of people in certain areas.[18] Most of the exponential human population growth worldwide is occurring in or close to biodiversity hotspots.[9] This may explain why human population density accounts for 87.9% of the variation in numbers of threatened species across 114 countries, providing indisputable evidence that people play the largest role in decreasing biodiversity.[23] The boom in human population and migration of people into such species-rich regions are making conservation efforts not only more urgent but also more likely to conflict with local human interests.[9] The high local population density in such areas is directly correlated to the poverty status of the local people, most of whom lacking an education and family planning.[19]\\r\\nFrom the Geist and Lambin (2002) study described in the previous section, the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows (with the percent of the 152 cases the factor played a significant role in): economic factors (81%), institutional or policy factors (78%), technological factors (70%), cultural or socio-political factors (66%), and demographic factors (61%). The main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets (68%), which are driven by national and international demands; urban industrial growth (38%); low domestic costs for land, labor, fuel, and timber (32%); and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops (25%). Institutional and policy factors included formal pro-deforestation policies on land development (40%), economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement (34%), and subsidies for land-based activities (26%); property rights and land-tenure insecurity (44%); and policy failures such as corruption, lawlessness, or mismanagement (42%). The main technological factor was the poor application of technology in the wood industry (45%), which leads to wasteful logging practices. Within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values (63%), individual/household behavior (53%), public unconcern toward forest environments (43%), missing basic values (36%), and unconcern by individuals (32%). Demographic factors were the in-migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas (38%) and growing population density  a result of the first factor  in those areas (25%).\\r\\nThere are also feedbacks and interactions among the proximate and underlying causes of deforestation that can amplify the process. Road construction has the largest feedback effect, because it interacts withand leads tothe establishment of new settlements and more people, which causes a growth in wood (logging) and food markets.[19] Growth in these markets, in turn, progresses the commercialization of agriculture and logging industries. When these industries become commercialized, they must become more efficient by utilizing larger or more modern machinery that often are worse on the habitat than traditional farming and logging methods. Either way, more land is cleared more rapidly for commercial markets. This common feedback example manifests just how closely related the proximate and underlying causes are to each other.\\r\\nHabitat destruction vastly increases an area's vulnerability to natural disasters like flood and drought, crop failure, spread of disease, and water contamination.[18] On the other hand, a healthy ecosystem with good management practices will reduce the chance of these events happening, or will at least mitigate adverse impacts.\\r\\nAgricultural land can actually suffer from the destruction of the surrounding landscape. Over the past 50 years, the destruction of habitat surrounding agricultural land has degraded approximately 40% of agricultural land worldwide via erosion, salinization, compaction, nutrient depletion, pollution, and urbanization.[18] Humans also lose direct uses of natural habitat when habitat is destroyed. Aesthetic uses such as birdwatching, recreational uses like hunting and fishing, and ecotourism usually rely upon virtually undisturbed habitat. Many people value the complexity of the natural world and are disturbed by the loss of natural habitats and animal or plant species worldwide.\\r\\nProbably the most profound impact that habitat destruction has on people is the loss of many valuable ecosystem services. Habitat destruction has altered nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and carbon cycles, which has increased the frequency and severity of acid rain, algal blooms, and fish kills in rivers and oceans and contributed tremendously to global climate change.[18] One ecosystem service whose significance is becoming more realized is climate regulation. On a local scale, trees provide windbreaks and shade; on a regional scale, plant transpiration recycles rainwater and maintains constant annual rainfall; on a global scale, plants (especially trees from tropical rainforests) from around the world counter the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by sequestering carbon dioxide through photosynthesis.[10] Other ecosystem services that are diminished or lost altogether as a result of habitat destruction include watershed management, nitrogen fixation, oxygen production, pollination (see pollinator decline),[25] waste treatment (i.e., the breaking down and immobilization of toxic pollutants), and nutrient recycling of sewage or agricultural runoff.[10]\\r\\nThe loss of trees from the tropical rainforests alone represents a substantial diminishing of the earths ability to produce oxygen and use up carbon dioxide. These services are becoming even more important as increasing carbon dioxide levels is one of the main contributors to global climate change.\\r\\nThe loss of biodiversity may not directly affect humans, but the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous. When biodiversity is lost, the environment loses many species that provide valuable and unique roles to the ecosystem. The environment and all its inhabitants rely on biodiversity to recover from extreme environmental conditions. When too much biodiversity is lost, a catastrophic event such as an earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption could cause an ecosystem to crash, and humans would obviously suffer from that. Loss of biodiversity also means that humans are losing animals that could have served as biological control agents and plants that could potentially provide higher-yielding crop varieties, pharmaceutical drugs to cure existing or future diseases or cancer, and new resistant crop varieties for agricultural species susceptible to pesticide-resistant insects or virulent strains of fungi, viruses, and bacteria.[10]\\r\\nThe negative effects of habitat destruction usually impact rural populations more directly than urban populations.[18] Across the globe, poor people suffer the most when natural habitat is destroyed, because less natural habitat means less natural resources per capita, yet wealthier people and countries simply have to pay more to continue to receive more than their per capita share of natural resources.\\r\\nAnother way to view the negative effects of habitat destruction is to look at the opportunity cost of keeping an area undisturbed. In other words, what are people losing out on by taking away a given habitat? A country may increase its food supply by converting forest land to row-crop agriculture, but the value of the same land may be much larger when it can supply natural resources or services such as clean water, timber, ecotourism, or flood regulation and drought control.[18]\\r\\nThe rapid expansion of the global human population is increasing the worlds food requirement substantially. Simple logic instructs that more people will require more food. In fact, as the worlds population increases dramatically, agricultural output will need to increase by at least 50%, over the next 30 years.[26] In the past, continually moving to new land and soils provided a boost in food production to appease the global food demand. That easy fix will no longer be available, however, as more than 98% of all land suitable for agriculture is already in use or degraded beyond repair.[27]\\r\\nThe impending global food crisis will be a major source of habitat destruction. Commercial farmers are going to become desperate to produce more food from the same amount of land, so they will use more fertilizers and less concern for the environment to meet the market demand. Others will seek out new land or will convert other land-uses to agriculture. Agricultural intensification will become widespread at the cost of the environment and its inhabitants. Species will be pushed out of their habitat either directly by habitat destruction or indirectly by fragmentation, degradation, or pollution. Any efforts to protect the worlds remaining natural habitat and biodiversity will compete directly with humans growing demand for natural resources, especially new agricultural lands.[26]\\r\\nIn most cases of tropical deforestation, three to four underlying causes are driving two to three proximate causes.[19] This means that a universal policy for controlling tropical deforestation would not be able to address the unique combination of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in each country.[19] Before any local, national, or international deforestation policies are written and enforced, governmental leaders must acquire a detailed understanding of the complex combination of proximate causes and underlying driving forces of deforestation in a given area or country.[19] This concept, along with many other results about tropical deforestation from the Geist and Lambin study, can easily be applied to habitat destruction in general. Governmental leaders need to take action by addressing the underlying driving forces, rather than merely regulating the proximate causes.

Due to the song's length, the introductory section and the latter half of the first verse are often omitted for brevity when the national anthem is played before a sporting event such as a soccer game.[2]","input":"What is the national anthem of paraguay called?"},{"output":"roughly 15% of the population","context":"In sociology, the upper middle class of the United States is the social group constituted by higher-status members of the middle class. This is in contrast to the term lower middle class, which refers to the group at the opposite end of the middle class scale. There is considerable debate as to how the upper middle class might be defined. According to Max Weber, the upper middle class consists of well-educated professionals with graduate degrees and comfortable incomes.\\r\\nThe American upper middle class is defined using income, education, occupation and the associated values as main indicators.[1] In the United States, the upper middle class is defined as consisting of white-collar professionals who have above-average personal incomes, advanced educational degrees[1] and a high degree of autonomy in their work, leading to higher job satisfaction.[2] The main occupational tasks of upper middle class individuals tend to center on conceptualizing, consulting, and instruction.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain professions can be categorized as \\"upper middle class,\\" though any such measurement must be considered subjective because of people's differing perception of class. Most people in the upper-middle class strata are highly educated white collar professionals such as physicians, dentists, lawyers, accountants, engineers, military officers, economists, urban planners, university professors, architects, stockbrokers, psychologists, scientists, actuaries, optometrists, pharmacists, high-level civil servants and the intelligentsia. Other common professions include corporate executives and CEOs, and successful business owners. Generally, people in these professions have an advanced post-secondary education and a comfortable standard of living.[1]\\r\\nEducation is probably the most important part of middle-class childrearing as they prepare their children to be successful in school. Upper middle-class parents expect their children to attend college. Along with hard work, these parents view educational performance and attainment as necessary components of financial success. Consequently, the majority of upper middle-class children assume they will attend college. For these children, college is not optionalit's essential. This thought can be seen even more so from parents with higher education, whose greater appreciation for autonomy leads them to want the same for their children. Most people encompassing this station in life have a high regard for higher education, particularly towards Ivy League colleges and other top tier schools throughout the United States. They probably, more than any other socio-economic class, strive for themselves and their children to obtain graduate or at least four-year undergraduate degrees, further reflecting the importance placed on education by middle-class families.[4]\\r\\nMembers of the upper middle class tend to place a high value on foreign travel, the arts, and high culture in general. This value is in line with the emphasis placed on education, as foreign travel increases one's understanding of other cultures and helps create a global perspective.\\r\\nMost mass affluent households and college-educated professionals tend to be center-right or conservative on fiscal issues.[5] A slight majority of college-educated professionals, who compose 15% of the population and 20% of the electorate, favor the Democratic Party.[6] Among those with six figure household incomes,[7] a slight majority favor the Republican Party. Per exit polls conducted by the television network CNN following the 2004 and 2006 U.S. elections, academia and those with postgraduate degrees (e.g., to include Ph.D. and J.D.) especially favor the Democratic Party.[8][9] In 2005, 72% of full-time faculty members at four-year institutions, the majority of whom are upper middle class,[1] identified as liberal.[10]\\r\\nThe upper middle class is often the dominant group to shape society and bring social movements to the forefront. Movements such as the Peace Movement, The Anti-Nuclear Movement, Environmentalism, the Anti-Smoking movement, and even in the past with Blue laws and the Temperance movement have been in large part (although not solely) products of the upper middle class. Some claim this is because this is the largest class (and the lowest class) with any true political power for positive change, while others claim some of the more restrictive social movements (such as with smoking and drinking) are based upon \\"saving people from themselves.\\"[3]\\r\\nIn the United States the term middle class and its subdivisions are an extremely vague concept as neither economists nor sociologists have precisely defined the term.[11] There are several perceptions of the upper middle class and what the term means. In academic models the term applies to highly educated salaried professionals whose work is largely self-directed. Many have graduate degrees with educational attainment serving as the main distinguishing feature of this class. Household incomes commonly exceed $100,000, with some smaller one-income earners household having incomes in the high 5-figure range.[1][7]\\r\\n\\"The upper middle class has grown...and its composition has changed. Increasingly salaried managers and professionals have replaced individual business owners and independent professionals. The key to the success of the upper middle class is the growing importance of educational certification...its lifestyles and opinions are becoming increasingly normative for the whole society. It is in fact a porous class, open to people...who earn the right credentials. \\"- Dennis Gilbert, The American Class Structure, 1998.[7]\\r\\nIn addition to having autonomy in their work, above-average incomes, and advanced educations, the upper middle class also tends to be influential, setting trends and largely shaping public opinion.[3][7] Overall, members of this class are also secure from economic down-turns and, unlike their counterparts in the statistical middle class, do not need to fear downsizing, corporate cost-cutting, or outsourcingan economic benefit largely attributable to their graduate degrees and comfortable incomes, likely in the top income quintile or top third.[1] Typical professions for this class include professors, accountants, architects, urban planners, engineers, economists, pharmacists, executive assistants, physicians, optometrists, dentists, and lawyers.[3][12]\\r\\nWhile many Americans see income as the prime determinant of class, occupational status, educational attainment, and value systems are equally important. Income is in part determined by the scarcity of certain skill sets.[1] As a result an occupation that requires a scarce skill, the attainment of which is often achieved through an educational degree, and entrusts its occupant with a high degree of influence will usually offer high economic compensation.[13] There are also differences between household and individual income. In 2005, 42% of US households (76% among the top quintile) had two or more income earners; as a result, 18% of households but only 5% of individuals had six figure incomes.[14] To illustrate, two nurses each making $55,000 per year can out-earn, in a household sense, a single attorney who makes a median of $95,000 annually.[15][16]\\r\\nSociologists Dennis Gilbert, Willam Thompson and Joseph Hickey estimate the upper middle class to constitute roughly 15% of the population. Using the 15% figure one may conclude that the American upper middle class consists, strictly in an income sense, of professionals with personal incomes in excess of $62,500, who commonly reside in households with six figure incomes.[1][7][14][17] The difference between personal and household income can be explained by considering that 76% of households with incomes exceeding $90,000 (the top 20%) had two or more income earners.[14]\\r\\nSOURCE: US Census Bureau, 2006[18][19]","input":"What is the percentage of upper middle class in america?"},{"output":"Richard Cho","context":"Richard Cho (born August 10, 1965) is an American basketball executive who most recently served as the general manager of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association.

The first was Jawaharlal Nehru of the Indian National Congress party,[2] who was sworn-in on 15 August 1947, when India gained independence from the British. Serving until his death in May 1964, Nehru remains India's longest-serving prime minister. He was succeeded by fellow Congressman Lal Bahadur Shastri, whose 19-month term also ended in death. Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, succeeded Shastri in 1966 to become the country's first woman premier. Eleven years later, she was voted out of power in favour of the Janata Party, whose leader Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress prime minister. After he resigned in 1979, his former deputy Charan Singh briefly held office until Indira Gandhi was voted back six months later. Indira Gandhi's second stint as Prime Minister ended five years later on the morning of 31 October 1984, when she was gunned down by her own bodyguards. That evening, her son Rajiv Gandhi was sworn-in as India's youngest premier, and the third from his family. Thus far, members of NehruÿGandhi dynasty have been Prime Minister for a total of 37 years and 303 days.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nRajiv's five-year term ended with his former cabinet colleague, V. P.

A six-month interlude under Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar followed, after which the Congress party returned to power, forming the government under P. V. Narasimha Rao in June 1991. Rao's five-year term was succeeded by four short-lived governmentsthe Bharatiya Janata Party's Atal Bihari Vajpayee for 13 days in 1996, a year each under United Front prime ministers H. D.

Despite being commercially unsuccessful, the group's first single, \\"Good Life\\", led to oldest sister Toni Braxton's solo career.[1] All five members reunited in 2011 to star in the WE tv reality television series Braxton Family Values alongside their mother, Evelyn Braxton.\\r\\nIn October 2015, the group including Toni, Tamar, Traci, Trina and Towanda, released new material entitled Braxton Family Christmas with five members. The album was released on October 30.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Braxtons' parents are Rev. Michael Braxton Sr. (born June 26, 1947) and Evelyn Braxton (born January 14, 1948). Toni Michele Braxton was born on October 7, 1967. Michael Conrad Braxton Jr., the only son, was born on November 17, 1968, then Traci Renee Braxton was born on April 2, 1971. Towanda Chloe Braxton was born on September 18, 1973. The Braxtons' fifth child, Trina Evette Braxton, was born on December 3, 1974. The youngest sibling, Tamar Estine Braxton, was born on March 17, 1977. They are originally from Severn, Maryland.[4]\\r\\nThe sisters began to harmonize together when a then 5 year-old Tamar demanded, \\"Somebody get me some toilet paper!\\" Each sister and brother Michael soon after went in the bathroom and began singing the \\"Toilet Paper Song.\\" The Braxtons credit this incident as their first song-writing experience and the first time that they harmonized as a group.[5] Growing up, they sang in the choir at several churches and toured the East Coast with their religious parents singing at various events.[6]\\r\\nToni, Traci, Towanda, Trina, and Tamar Braxton signed their first record deal with Arista Records in 1989. In 1990, they released their first single, \\"Good Life\\". It would be their only single as a fivesome. \\"Good Life\\" was not a hit, peaking at No. 79 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart. At the time of the single's release, the members' age differences created a problem with marketing. Subsequently, The Braxtons were dropped from Arista Records.\\r\\nIn 1991, during a showcase with Antonio \\"L.A.\\" Reid and Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds, who were in the process of forming LaFace Records, Toni Braxton, minus her four sisters, was chosen and signed as the label's first female solo artist. At the time, the remaining members were told that LaFace was not looking for another girl group since it had just signed TLC.[7][8]\\r\\nAfter Toni's departure from the group in 1991, the remaining Braxtons members became backup singers for Toni's first U.S. tour, music videos, and promotional appearances. Traci, Towanda, Trina, and Tamar were featured in the music video for Toni Braxton's third single, \\"Seven Whole Days\\", from her debut album.\\r\\nIn 1993, LaFace Records A&R Vice President, Bryant Reid, signed The Braxtons to LaFace. However, the group never released an album or single for the record label. When Reid moved on to work for Atlantic Records, he convinced executives at LaFace to allow him take the group to Atlantic also.[8][9]\\r\\nIt was reported in Vibe magazine that in 1995 Traci Braxton had left the group to pursue a career as a youth counselor.[10] However, it was not confirmed until 2004 when Towanda Braxton appeared in season 2 of the reality show Starting Over, that Traci was not allowed to sign with Atlantic because of her pregnancy at the time.\\r\\nIn June 1996, Tamar, Trina, and Towanda returned with a new album entitled So Many Ways, which shared the same title as its lead single. Released on August 13, 1996, the album peaked at No. 26 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts.[11] It became their first and only LP. Atlantic Records A&R VP, Bryant Reid, served as the album's executive producer. At the time of its release, Reid told Billboard Magazine, \\"I had a vision for them then that was about young sophistication with sex appeal.\\" So Many Ways included production from Jermaine Dupri and Daryl Simmons along with Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart and Sean \\"Sep\\" Hall. The album also included a cover of Diana Ross's hit \\"The Boss\\" and Klymaxx's song \\"I'd Still Say Yes\\".[9]\\r\\nThe Braxtons released a music video in order to promote \\"So Many Ways\\". It was directed by Cameron Casey and featured upcoming actor Mekhi Phifer.[12] The trio also performed a remixed version of \\"So Many Ways\\" with rapper Jay-Z on September 9, 1996 at the Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards.[13] The single was also used as the opening track for the soundtrack to the comedy film High School High.[14] \\"So Many Ways\\" went on to peak at No. 83 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1996, No. 22 on the Billboard R&B Charts and number 32 on the UK Singles Chart in January 1997.[15]\\r\\nThe album's second single, \\"Only Love\\", was released on January 25, 1997 and peaked at number 52 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart. A music video for this song was also released.[11] A Masters At Work remix version of The Braxtons third single The Boss\\" reached number 1 on Billboard Dance/Club Play Chart in early 1997.[11] \\"Slow Flow\\" was the final single released from So Many Ways. It peaked at No. 26 on the UK Charts in July 1997, becoming their highest charting single in the UK.[16]\\r\\nThe Braxtons also served as the opening act for Toni Braxton on the European Leg of her Secrets Tour in 1997.\\r\\nThe Braxtons decided to part ways as a group after lead singer Tamar Braxton left to pursue a solo career with DreamWorks Records in 1999.[17] However, the members continued to sing and act in various other projects.\\r\\nTrina appeared in the 2004 Tyler Perry play Meet the Browns as Tracy Stevens. She was also part of the play Rise, written by Salt from Salt-n-Pepa and Christopher \\"Play\\" Martin from the rap group Kid 'n Play and starred in an off-Broadway production of Dreamgirls as Deena Jones. In 2004, Trina Braxton appeared in \\"The Walk\\" with Eva Pigford and Vanessa Bell. Additionally, she co-starred in two independent films, including Jail Party, and was host for the unbroadcast Urban Idol for UPN. She also made a cameo in Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad All By Myself as a member of a band performing with singer Mary J. Blige's character. Trina and Tamar performed as background singers and dancers for the entire duration of Toni's Libra Tour in 2006. They also performed in Toni Braxton: Revealed at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino until R&B singer Sparkle replaced Tamar in 2006 and fellow former Braxtons member Towanda Braxton replaced them.[18] In 2009, Trina joined the wedding band \\"Simply Irresistible\\" as a lead vocalist.[19] In 2012, Trina left the band to pursue a solo music career, releasing her debut solo single \\"Party Or Go Home\\" in March 2012.\\r\\nTowanda Braxton appeared in season 2 of the reality show Starting Over. She performed and recorded a solo song, \\"Here I Am\\", for the show and conducted a radio interview on the Wendy Williams Experience about her time on Starting Over. Towanda is also a member of Zeta Phi Beta sorority and pledged at Bowie State University in 1995.[20] In September 2005, People magazine's website reported that Towanda was pregnant.[21]\\r\\nTamar Braxton released her debut solo album Tamar in 2000. She also made a cameo in the music video for \\"He Wasn't Man Enough\\". She appeared for a short time as Sasha in the stage play version of Madea Goes to Jail in 2005 alongside Tyler Perry and Cassi Davis. Tamar co-wrote several songs and sang background vocals for several of Toni's albums including Snowflakes, More Than a Woman, Libra, and Pulse.[22] In 2012, Tamar released the single \\"Love and War\\", followed by two albums in 2013: a studio album entitled Love and War, followed by a Christmas album entitled Winter Loversland.\\r\\nIn 2010, The Braxtons, including Traci Braxton, appeared in sister Toni Braxton's music video for her dance single \\"Make My Heart\\".[23]\\r\\nIn January 2011, WE tv confirmed that it had signed Toni Braxton and her sisters, Traci, Towanda, Trina, and Tamar for a reality series, entitled Braxton Family Values, to be marketed as one of the network's flagship shows.[24] The show looks at the relationship between Toni, her mom, and her sisters along with the interpersonal relationships of each family member. After only four episodes, the series had renewed for a second season. There would be 13 more one-hour episodes of Braxton Family Values on WE tv in 2012, up from 10 during the debut season? which was later upped to a 26 episode second season, including the Reunion Show.[25]\\r\\nAs of the second season finale of Braxton Family Values, it is still unclear whether or not the EP that The Braxtons were working on will be released. During the show's reunion, Toni Braxton stated that she thought The Braxtons should \\"feature on [her] record\\" instead of her completely rejoining the group for a full EP.[26]\\r\\nThe Braxtons posed for the June 2011 VIBE magazine summer swimwear issue. They also presented the \\"Best Gospel Artist\\" award to Mary Mary at the 2011 BET Awards.[27]\\r\\nIn July 2014, a sneak peek of the fourth season of \\"Braxton Family Values\\" was uploaded via YouTube on WE tv's user account of the Braxton sisters discussing on doing a gospel record together.[28] In the same time, Toni, Tamar and Trina guest starred on their sister Traci's music video \\"Last Call\\".[29]\\r\\nIn October 2015, the group including Toni, Tamar, Traci, Trina and Towanda, released an album titled Braxton Family Christmas as five members.

The Strip is approximately 4.2 miles (6.8?km) in length,[1] located immediately south of the Las Vegas city limits in the unincorporated towns of Paradise and Winchester. However, the Strip is often referred to as being in Las Vegas.\\r\\nMany of the largest hotel, casino, and resort properties in the world are located on the Las Vegas Strip. The road's cityscape is highlighted by its use of contemporary architecture, lights and wide variety of attractions. Its hotels, casinos, restaurants, residential high-rises, entertainment offerings, and skyline have established the Las Vegas Strip as one of the most popular and iconic tourist destinations in the United States and the world.[2] Most of the Strip has also been designated as an All-American Road[3][4] and is considered a scenic route at night.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, the casinos that were not in Downtown Las Vegas along Fremont Street were limited to outside the city limits on Las Vegas Boulevard. In 1959, the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign was constructed exactly 4.5 miles (7.2?km) outside the city limits. The sign is today located in the median just south of Russell Road, across from the now-demolished Klondike Hotel & Casino, about 0.4 miles (0.64?km) south of the southernmost entrance to Mandalay Bay (the southernmost casino).[6]\\r\\nIn the strictest sense, \\"the Strip\\" refers only to the stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that is roughly between Sahara Avenue and Russell Road, a distance of 4.2 miles (6.8?km).[7][8] However, the term is often used to refer not only to the road but also to the various casinos and resorts that line the road, and even to properties that are not on the road but in proximity. Phrases such as Strip Area, Resort Corridor or Resort District are sometimes used to indicate a larger geographical area, including properties 1 mile (1.6?km) or more away from Las Vegas Boulevard, such as the Hard Rock, Rio, Palms, and Hooters casinos.\\r\\nA long-standing definition considers the Strip's northern terminus as the SLS, though travel guides typically extend it to include the Stratosphere, 0.4 miles (0.64?km) to the north. Mandalay Bay, located just north of Russell Road, is the southernmost resort considered to be on the Strip (the Klondike was the southernmost until 2006, when it was closed, although it was not included in Las Vegas Strip on some definitions and travel guides).\\r\\nBecause of the number and size of the resorts, the Resort Corridor can be quite wide. Interstate 15 runs roughly parallel and 0.5 to 0.8 miles (0.80 to 1.29?km) to the west of Las Vegas Boulevard for the entire length of the Strip. Paradise Road runs to the east in a similar fashion, and ends at St. Louis Avenue. The eastern side of the Strip is bounded by McCarran International Airport south of Tropicana Avenue.\\r\\nNorth of this point, the Resort Corridor can be considered to extend as far east as Paradise Road, although some consider Koval Lane as a less inclusive boundary. Interstate 15 is sometimes considered the western edge of the Resort Corridor from Interstate 215 to Spring Mountain Road. North of this point, Industrial Road serves as the western edge.\\r\\nNewer hotels and resorts such as South Point, Grandview Resort and the M Resort are on Las Vegas Boulevard South as distant as 8 miles south of the \\"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\\" sign. Marketing for these casinos usually states that they are on southern Las Vegas Boulevard and not \\"Strip\\" properties.\\r\\nThe first casino to be built on Highway 91 was the Pair-o-Dice Club in 1931, but the first resort on what is currently the Strip was the El Rancho Vegas, opening on April 3, 1941, with 63 rooms. That casino/ resort stood for almost 20 years before being destroyed by a fire in 1960. Its success spawned a second hotel on what would become the Strip, the Hotel Last Frontier, in 1942. Organized crime figures such as New York's Bugsy Siegel took interest in the growing gaming center leading to other resorts such as the Flamingo, which opened in 1946, and the Desert Inn, which opened in 1950. The funding for many projects was provided through the American National Insurance Company, which was based in the then notorious gambling empire of Galveston, Texas.[9][10]\\r\\nLas Vegas Boulevard South was previously called Arrowhead Highway, or Los Angeles Highway. The Strip was named by Los Angeles police officer and businessman Guy McAfee, after his hometown's Sunset Strip.[11]\\r\\nCaesars Palace was established in 1966. In 1968, Kirk Kerkorian purchased the Flamingo and hired Sahara Hotels Vice President Alex Shoofey as President. Alex Shoofey brought along 33 of Sahara's top executives. The Flamingo was used to train future employees of the International Hotel, which was under construction. Opening in 1969, the International Hotel, with 1,512 rooms, began the era of mega-resorts. The International is known as Westgate Las Vegas today. The first MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, also a Kerkorian property, opened in 1973 with 2,084 rooms. At the time, this was one of the largest hotels in the world by number of rooms. The Rossiya Hotel built in 1967 in Moscow, for instance, had 3,200 rooms; however, most of the rooms in the Rossiya Hotel were single rooms of 118 sq. ft (roughly 1/4 size of a standard room at the MGM Grand Resort). On November 21, 1980, the MGM Grand suffered the worst resort fire in the history of Las Vegas as a result of electrical problems, killing 87 people. It reopened eight months later. In 1986, Kerkorian sold the MGM Grand to Bally Manufacturing, and it was renamed Bally's.\\r\\nThe Wet 'n Wild water park opened in 1985 and was located on the south side of the Sahara hotel. The park closed at the end of the 2004 season and was later demolished. The opening of The Mirage in 1989 set a new level to the Las Vegas experience, as smaller hotels and casinos made way for the larger mega-resorts. The Rio and the Excalibur opened in 1990. These huge facilities offer entertainment and dining options, as well as gambling and lodging. This change affected the smaller, well-known and now historic hotels and casinos, like The Dunes, The Sands, the Stardust, and the Sahara.\\r\\nThe lights along the Strip have been dimmed in a sign of respect to six performers and one other major Las Vegas figure upon their deaths. They are Elvis Presley (1977), Sammy Davis Jr. (1990),[12] Dean Martin (1995), George Burns (1996), Frank Sinatra (1998), former UNLV basketball head coach Jerry Tarkanian (2015),[13] and Don Rickles (2017).[14] The Strip lights were dimmed later in 2017 as a memorial to victims of a mass shooting at a concert held adjacent to the Strip.[15] In 2005, Clark County renamed a section of Industrial Road (south of Twain Avenue) as Dean Martin Drive, also as a tribute to the famous Rat Pack singer, actor, and frequent Las Vegas entertainer.\\r\\nIn an effort to attract families, resorts offered more attractions geared toward youth, but had limited success. The (current) MGM Grand opened in 1993 with MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park, but the park closed in 2000 due to lack of interest. Similarly, in 2003 Treasure Island closed its own video arcade and abandoned the previous pirate theme, adopting the new ti name.[16]\\r\\nIn addition to the large hotels, casinos and resorts, the Strip is home to a few smaller casinos and other attractions, such as M&M World, Adventuredome and the Fashion Show Mall. Starting in the mid-1990s, the Strip became a popular New Year's Eve celebration destination.\\r\\nWith the opening of Bellagio, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn and Encore resorts, the strip trended towards the luxurious high end segment through most of the 2000s, while some older resorts added major expansions and renovations, including some de-theming of the earlier themed hotels. High end dining, specialty retail, spas and nightclubs increasingly became options for visitors in addition to gambling at most Strip resorts. There was also a trend towards expensive residential condo units on the strip.\\r\\nIn 2004, MGM Mirage announced plans for CityCenter, a 66-acre (27?ha), $7?billion multi-use project on the site of the Boardwalk hotel and adjoining land. It consists of hotel, casino, condo, retail, art, business and other uses on the site. City Center is currently the largest such complex in the world. Construction began in April 2006, with most elements of the project opened in late 2009. Also in 2006, the Las Vegas Strip lost its longtime status as the world's highest-grossing gambling center, falling to second place behind Macau.[17]\\r\\nIn 2012, the High Roller Ferris wheel and a retail district called The LINQ Promenade broke ground, in an attempt to diversify attractions beyond that of casino resorts. Renovations and rebrandings such as The Cromwell Las Vegas and the SLS Las Vegas continued to transform The Strip in 2014. The Las Vegas Festival Grounds opened in 2015. In 2016, the T-Mobile Arena, The Park, the Lucky Dragon Hotel and Casino, and the Park Theatre opened. Smaller changes and developments are taking place as well.[18]\\r\\nOn October 1, 2017, a mass shooting occurred on the Strip at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival, adjacent to the Mandalay Bay hotel. This incident became the deadliest mass shooting in modern United States history.[19]\\r\\nRTC Transit (previously Citizens Area Transit, or CAT) provides bus service on the Strip with double decker buses known as The Deuce. The Deuce runs between Mandalay Bay at the southern end of the Strip (and to the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign and South Strip Transfer Terminal after midnight) to the Bonneville Transit Center (BTC) and the Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas, with stops near every casino. RTC also operates an express bus called the Strip and Downtown Express (SDX). This route connects the Strip to the Las Vegas Convention Center and Downtown Las Vegas to the north, with stops at selected hotels and shopping attractions (Las Vegas Premium Outlets North & South).\\r\\nWhile not on the Strip itself, the Las Vegas Monorail runs on the east side of the Strip corridor from Tropicana Avenue to Sahara Avenue.[31]\\r\\nSeveral free trams operate on the west side of the Strip:\\r\\nPrior to CAT bus service beginning operations in 1992, mass transit on the Strip was provided by a private transit company, Las Vegas Transit. The Strip route was their only profitable route and supported the whole bus system.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Deuce bus (CAT Enviro500)\\r\\nAria Express\\r\\nMandalay Bay Tram\\r\\nConcerning pedestrian safety and to help alleviate traffic congestion at popular intersections, several pedestrian footbridges were erected in 1990s. Some feature designs that match the theme of the nearby resorts. The Tropicana ÿ Las Vegas Boulevard footbridges were the first to be installed, and based on the success of this project additional footbridges have been built on Las Vegas Boulevard at the Flamingo Road intersection connecting Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Bally's, and The Cromwell; between The Mirage/Treasure Island and The Venetian, and at the Las Vegas Boulevard-Spring Mountain and Sands Avenue intersection connecting the Wynn with the Fashion Show Mall, The Palazzo and Treasure Island. The latest to be completed connects Planet Hollywood, CityCenter and The Cosmopolitan at the Harmon Avenue intersection.[32]\\r\\nAccording to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority's annual Las Vegas Visitor Profile Study, only 36% of people said they walked around the Strip, a figure that is a drop from 2013 (52%).[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2000, Bali Hai Golf Club opened just south of Mandalay Bay and the Strip.[33]\\r\\nAs land values on the Strip have increased over the years, the resort-affiliated golf courses been removed to make way for building projects. The Tropicana Country Club closed in 1990[34] and the Dunes golf course in the mid-90s. Steve Wynn, founder of previously owned Mirage Resorts, purchased the Desert Inn and golf course for his new company Wynn Resorts and redeveloped the course as the Wynn Golf Club. This course closed in 2017. The Aladdin also had a nine-hole golf course in the 1960's.[35]\\r\\nIn 2016, a TopGolf opened near the Strip.[36]\\r\\nThe strip is home to many amusement parks and rides. These include:\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Strip is well known for its lounges, showrooms, theaters and nightclubs;[39] most of the attractions and shows on the Strip are located on the hotel casino properties. Some of the more popular free attractions visible from the Strip include the water fountains at Bellagio, the volcano at The Mirage, and the Fall of Atlantis and Festival Fountain at Caesars Palace. There are several Cirque du Soleil shows, such as K at the MGM Grand, O at Bellagio, Mystre at Treasure Island, Zumanity (for ages 18 and older) at New York-New York, Criss Angel Mindfreak at the Luxor, and Michael Jackson: One at Mandalay Bay.[40]\\r\\nMany notable artists have performed in Las Vegas, including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Wayne Newton, Liza Minnelli, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Liberace,[41] and in more recent years Celine Dion, Britney Spears, Barry Manilow, Cher, Elton John, Bette Midler, Donny and Marie Osmond, Garth Brooks, Jennifer Lopez, Reba McEntire, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, Criss Angel, and Olivia Newton-John have had residencies in the various resorts on the Strip. The only movie theatre directly on the Strip was the 10-screen Regal Showcase Theatre in the Showcase Mall. The theater opened in 1997 and was operated by Regal Entertainment Group,[42] until its closure in 2018.[43]\\r\\nThe Strip is home to many entertainment venues. Most of the resorts have a showroom, nightclub and/or live music venue on the property and a few have large multipurpose arenas.

Opened in 1957, the 26,372-foot (4.995?mi; 8.038?km) bridge (familiarly known as \\"Big Mac\\" and \\"Mighty Mac\\")[4] is the world's 19th-longest main span and the longest suspension bridge between anchorages in the Western Hemisphere.[5] The Mackinac Bridge is part of Interstate 75 and the Lakes Michigan and Huron components of the Great Lakes Circle Tours across the straits; it is also a segment of the U.S. North Country National Scenic Trail. The bridge connects the city of St. Ignace on the north end with the village of Mackinaw City on the south.\\r\\nEnvisioned since the 1880s, the bridge was designed by the engineer David B. Steinman and completed in 1957 only after many decades of struggles to begin construction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge opened on November 1, 1957,[6] connecting two peninsulas linked for decades by ferries. A year later, the bridge was formally dedicated as the \\"world's longest suspension bridge between anchorages\\", allowing a superlative comparison to the Golden Gate Bridge, which had a longer center span between towers, and the San FranciscoÿOakland Bay Bridge, which had an anchorage in the middle.\\r\\nIt remains the longest suspension bridge with two towers between anchorages in the Western Hemisphere.[5] Much longer anchorage-to-anchorage spans have been built in the Eastern Hemisphere, including the Akashi Kaiky Bridge in Japan (12,826?ft or 3,909?m). But the long leadups to the anchorages on the Mackinac make its total shoreline-to-shoreline length of 5 miles (8?km) longer than the Akashi-Kaikyo (2.4?mi or 3.9?km).\\r\\nThe length of the bridge's main span is 3,800 feet (1,158?m), which makes it the third-longest suspension span in the United States and 19th longest suspension span worldwide. It is also one of the world's longest bridges overall.\\r\\nThe Algonquian peoples who lived in the straits area prior to the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century called this region Michilimackinac, which is widely understood to mean the Great Turtle. This is thought to refer to the shape of what is now called Mackinac Island. This interpretation of the word is debated by scholars. Trading posts at the Straits of Mackinac attracted peak populations during the summer trading season; they also developed as intertribal meeting places.[7]\\r\\nAs exploitation of the state's mineral and timber resources increased during the 19th century, the area became an important transport hub. In 1881 the three railroads that reached the Straits, the Michigan Central, Grand Rapids & Indiana, and the Detroit, Mackinac & Marquette, jointly established the Mackinac Transportation Company to operate a railroad car ferry service across the straits and connect the two peninsulas.[8]\\r\\nImproved highways along the eastern shores of the Lower Peninsula brought increased automobile traffic to the Straits region starting in the 1910s. The state of Michigan initiated an automobile ferry service between Mackinaw City and St. Ignace in 1923; it eventually operated nine ferry boats that would carry as many as 9,000 vehicles per day. Traffic backups could stretch as long as 16 miles (26?km).[9]\\r\\nAfter the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883, local residents began to imagine that such a structure could span the straits. In 1884, a store owner in St. Ignace published a newspaper advertisement that included a reprint of an artist's conception of the Brooklyn Bridge with the caption \\"Proposed bridge across the Straits of Mackinac\\".[10]\\r\\nThe idea of the bridge was discussed in the Michigan Legislature as early as the 1880s. At the time, the Straits of Mackinac area was becoming a popular tourist destination, especially following the creation of Mackinac National Park on Mackinac Island in 1875.\\r\\nAt a July 1888 meeting of the board of directors of the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, Cornelius Vanderbilt II proposed that a bridge be built across the straits, of a design similar to the one then under construction across the Firth of Forth in Scotland. This would advance commerce in the region and help lengthen the resort season of the hotel.[10]\\r\\nDecades went by with no formal action. In 1920, the Michigan state highway commissioner advocated construction of a floating tunnel across the Straits. At the invitation of the state legislature, C. E. Fowler of New York City put forth a plan for a long series of causeways and bridges across the straits from Cheboygan, 17 miles (27?km) southeast of Mackinaw City, to St. Ignace, using Bois Blanc, Round, and Mackinac islands as intermediate steps.\\r\\nIn 1923, the state legislature ordered the State Highway Department to establish ferry service across the strait. More and more people used ferries to cross the straits each year, and as they did, the movement to build a bridge increased. Chase Osborn, a former governor, wrote,\\r\\n\\"Michigan is unifying itself, and a magnificent new route through Michigan to Lake Superior and the Northwest United States is developing, via the Straits of Mackinac. It cannot continue to grow as it ought with clumsy and inadequate ferries for any portion of the year.\\"[11]\\r\\nBy 1928, the ferry service had become so popular and so expensive to operate that Michigan Governor Fred W. Green ordered the department to study the feasibility of building a bridge across the strait. The department deemed the idea feasible, estimating the cost at $30?million (equivalent to $2.11?billion in 2016[12]).\\r\\nIn 1934, the Michigan Legislature created the Mackinac Straits Bridge Authority to explore possible methods of constructing and funding the proposed bridge. The Legislature authorized the Authority to seek financing for the project. In the mid-1930s, during the Great Depression, when numerous infrastructure projects received federal aid, the Authority twice attempted to obtain federal funds for the project but was unsuccessful. The United States Army Corps of Engineers and President Franklin D. Roosevelt endorsed the project but Congress never appropriated funds. Between 1936 and 1940, the Authority selected a route for the bridge based on preliminary studies. Borings were made for a detailed geological study of the route.\\r\\nThe preliminary plans for the bridge featured a 3-lane roadway, a railroad crossing on the underdeck of the span, and a center-anchorage double-suspension bridge configuration similar to the design of the San Francisco?ÿ Oakland Bay Bridge. Because this would have required sinking an anchorage pier in the deepest area of the Straits, the practicality of this design may have been questionable.[citation needed] A concrete causeway, approximately 4,000 feet (1,219?m), extending from the northern shore, was constructed in shallow water from 1939 to 1941. However, a unique engineering challenge was created by the tremendous forces that operate against the base of the bridge, because the lakes freeze during the winter, causing large icebergs to place enormous stress on the bridge.\\r\\nAt that time, with funding for the project still uncertain, further work was put on hold because of the outbreak of World War II. The Mackinac Straits Bridge Authority was abolished by the state legislature in 1947, but the same body created a new Mackinac Bridge Authority three years later in 1950. In June 1950, engineers were retained for the project. By then, it was reported that cars queuing for the ferry at Mackinaw City did not reach St. Ignace until five hours later, and the typical capacity of 460 vehicles per hour could not match the estimated 1600 for a bridge.[13]\\r\\nAfter a report by the engineers in January 1951,[14] the state legislature authorized the sale of $85?million (equivalent to $2.08?billion in 2016[12]) in bonds for bridge construction on April 30, 1952. However, a weak bond market in 1953 forced a delay of more than a year before the bonds could be issued.\\r\\nDavid B. Steinman was appointed as the design engineer in January 1953 and by the end of 1953, estimates and contracts had been negotiated. A Civil Engineer at the firm, Abul Hasnat, did the preliminary plans for the bridge. Total cost estimate at that time was $95?million (equivalent to $2.23?billion in 2016[12]) with estimated completion by November 1, 1956. Tolls collected were to pay for the bridge in 20 years.[15] Construction began on May 7, 1954. The American Bridge Division of United States Steel Corporation was awarded a contract of more than $44?million (equivalent to $1.05?billion in 2016[12]) to build the steel superstructure.\\r\\nConstruction, staged using the 1939-41 causeway, took three and a half years (four summers, no winter construction) at a total cost of $100 million and the lives of five workers. Contrary to popular belief, none of them are entombed in the Bridge.[16] It opened to traffic on schedule on November 1, 1957, and the ferry service was discontinued on the same day. The Bridge was formally dedicated on June 25, 1958.\\r\\nG. Mennen Williams was governor during the construction of the Mackinac Bridge. He began the tradition of the governor leading the Mackinac Bridge Walk across it every Labor Day.[17] U.S. Senator Prentiss M. Brown has been called the \\"father of the Mackinac Bridge,\\"[18] and was honored with a special memorial bridge token created by the Mackinac Bridge Authority.[19]\\r\\nThe bridge officially achieved its 100?millionth crossing exactly forty years after its dedication, on June 25, 1998.[2] The 50th anniversary of the bridge's opening was celebrated on November 1, 2007 in a ceremony hosted by the Mackinac Bridge Authority at the viewing park adjacent to the St. Ignace causeway.[2]\\r\\nThe design of the Mackinac Bridge was directly influenced by the lessons from the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which failed in 1940 because of its instability in high winds. Three years after that disaster, Steinman had published a theoretical analysis of suspension-bridge stability problems, which recommended that future bridge designs include deep stiffening trusses to support the bridge deck and an open-grid roadway to reduce its wind resistance. Both of these features were incorporated into the design of the Mackinac Bridge. The stiffening truss is open to reduce wind resistance. The road deck is shaped as an airfoil to provide lift in a cross wind, and the center two lanes are open grid to allow vertical (upward) air flow, which fairly precisely cancels the lift, making the roadway stable in design in winds of up to 150 miles per hour (240?km/h).\\r\\nThe Mackinac Bridge is currently a toll bridge on Interstate 75 (I-75). Prior to the coming of I-75, the bridge carried US Highway 27 (US?27). It is one of only three segments of I-75 that are tolled, the others being the American half of the International Bridge near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Alligator Alley in Florida. The current toll is $4.00 for automobiles and $5.00 per axle for trucks.[3] The Mackinac Bridge Authority raised the toll in 2007 to fund a $300?million renovation program, which would include completely replacing the bridge deck.[20]\\r\\nEvery Labor Day, the bridge is open to walkers for the Mackinac Bridge Walk.\\r\\nPainting of the bridge takes seven years,[21] and when painting of the bridge is complete, it begins again.\\r\\nThe bridge celebrated its 150 millionth vehicle crossing on September 6, 2009.[22]\\r\\nFive workers died during the construction of the bridge.[23]\\r\\nAll five men are memorialized on a plaque near the bridge's southern end. Contrary to folklore, no bodies are embedded in the concrete.[25][26]\\r\\nOne worker has died since the bridge was completed. Daniel Doyle fell 60 to 70 feet (18 to 21?m) from scaffolding on August 7, 1997. He survived the fall but fell victim to the 50?F (10?C) water temperature. His body was recovered the next day in 95 feet (29?m) of water.\\r\\nTwo vehicles have fallen off the bridge.\\r\\nOn September 10, 1978, a small private plane carrying United States Marine Corps Reserve officers Maj. Virgil Osborne, Capt. James Robbins, and Capt. Wayne W. Wisbrock smashed into one of the bridge's suspension cables while flying in a heavy fog. The impact tore the wings off the plane, which then plunged into the Straits of Mackinac. All three men were killed.[32]\\r\\nBecause the bridge is not accessible to pedestrians,[a] suicides by jumping from the bridge have been rare, with the most recent confirmed case taking place on December 31, 2012.[33] There have been roughly a dozen suicides by people jumping off the bridge.[34]\\r\\nSome individuals have difficulty crossing bridges, a phenomenon known as gephyrophobia. The Mackinac Bridge Authority has a Drivers Assistance Program that provides drivers for those with gephyrphobia, or anyone who is more comfortable having someone else drive them across. More than a thousand people use this service every year. Those interested can arrange, either by phone or with the toll collector, to have their cars or motorcycles driven to the other end. There is no additional fee for this service. Bicycles and pedestrians are not normally permitted on the bridge. An exception is allowed for riders of two annual bicycle tours. On an everyday basis, for a $5.00 fee, the Authority will transport bicyclists and their vehicles across the bridge.[3]\\r\\nTravelers across the Mackinac Bridge can listen to an AM radio broadcast that recounts the history of the bridge and provides updates on driving conditions.[35]\\r\\nThe Mackinac Bridge Walk has been held each year since 1958, when it was led by Governor G. Mennen Williams. The first walk was held during the Bridge's Dedication Ceremony held in late June, and has been held on Labor Day since 1959. School buses from local districts transport walkers from Mackinaw City to St. Ignace to begin the walk. Thousands of people, traditionally led by the Governor of Michigan, cross the five-mile (8?km) span on foot from St. Ignace to Mackinaw City. Before 1964, people walked the Bridge from Mackinaw City to St. Ignace. Prior to 2017, two lanes of the bridge would remain open to public vehicle traffic; this policy was changed in 2017 to close the entire bridge to public vehicle traffic for the duration of the event.[36] The Bridge Walk is the only day of the year that hikers can hike this section of the North Country National Scenic Trail.[37]\\r\\nDuring summers, the Upper Peninsula and the Mackinac Bridge have become a major tourist destination.[38] In addition to visitors to Mackinac Island, the bridge has attracted interest from a diverse group of tourists including bridge enthusiasts, bird-watchers, and photographers.[39]\\r\\nOn June 25, 1958, to coincide with the 1958 celebration of the November 1957 opening, the United States Postal Service (USPS) released a 3S commemorative stamp featuring the recently completed bridge. It was entitled \\"Connecting the Peninsulas of Michigan\\" and 107,195,200?copies were issued.[40] The USPS again honored the Mackinac Bridge as the subject of its 2010 priority mail $4.90 stamp, which went on sale February 3.[41] The bridge authority and MDOT unveiled the stamp, which featured a \\"seagulls-eye view\\" of the landmark, with a passing freighter below.[42] Artist Dan Cosgrove worked from panoramic photographs to create the artwork. This is one of several designs that Cosgrove has produced for the USPS.[43]\\r\\nA feature-length documentary entitled Building the Mighty Mac was produced by Hollywood filmmaker Mark Howell in 1997 and was shown on PBS. The program features numerous interviews with the key people who built the structure and includes restored 16mm color footage of the bridge's construction.[44]\\r\\nThe history and building of the bridge was featured in a 2003 episode of the History Channel TV show Modern Marvels.[45]\\r\\nOn July 19, 2007, the Detroit Science Center unveiled an 80-foot-long (24?m), 19-foot-tall (5.8?m) scale model of the Mackinac Bridge. The exhibit was part of the states 50th anniversary celebration of the bridge. Sherwin-Williams supplied authentic Mackinac Bridge-colored paint for the project.[46]\\r\\nThe bridge and its maintenance crew were featured in an episode of the Discovery Channel TV show Dirty Jobs on August 7, 2007. Host Mike Rowe and crew spent several days filming the episode in May 2007.[47][48]\\r\\nMDOT also featured the bridge on the cover of the 2007 state highway map to celebrate its 50th anniversary.[49]","input":"What kind of bridge is the mackinac bridge?"},{"output":"Edward Lorenz","context":"The butterfly effect is a concept that states that \\"small causes can have larger effects\\".\\r\\nThis concept was initially used in theories about weather prediction but later the term became a popular metaphor in science writing.[1]\\r\\nIn chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. [2]\\r\\nThe term itself was coined by Edward Lorenz, and is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (exact time of formation, exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant butterfly several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of his weather model with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome. [3]\\r\\nThe idea that small causes may have large effects in general and in weather specifically was used from Henri Poincar to Norbert Wiener. Edward Lorenz's work placed the concept of instability of the earth's atmosphere onto a quantitative base and linked the concept of instability to the properties of large classes of dynamic systems which are undergoing nonlinear dynamics and deterministic chaos.[1]\\r\\nThe butterfly effect can also be demonstrated by very simple systems. For example, the randomness of the outcomes of throwing dice depends on this characteristic to amplify small differences in initial conditionsthe precise direction, thrust, and orientation of the throwinto significantly different dice paths and outcomes, which makes it virtually impossible to throw a dice exactly the same way twice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Vocation of Man (1800), Fichte says that \\"you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole\\".\\r\\nChaos theory and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions were described in the literature in a particular case of the three-body problem by Henri Poincar in 1890.[4] He later proposed that such phenomena could be common, for example, in meteorology.[5]\\r\\nIn 1898,[4] Jacques Hadamard noted general divergence of trajectories in spaces of negative curvature. Pierre Duhem discussed the possible general significance of this in 1908.[4]\\r\\nThe idea that one butterfly could eventually have a far-reaching ripple effect on subsequent historic events made its earliest known appearance in \\"A Sound of Thunder\\", a 1952 short story by Ray Bradbury about time travel.[6]\\r\\nIn 1961, Lorenz was running a numerical computer model to redo a weather prediction from the middle of the previous run as a shortcut. He entered the initial condition 0.506 from the printout instead of entering the full precision 0.506127 value. The result was a completely different weather scenario.[7]\\r\\nLorenz wrote:\\r\\n\\"At one point I decided to repeat some of the computations in order to examine what was happening in greater detail. I stopped the computer, typed in a line of numbers that it had printed out a while earlier, and set it running again. I went down the hall for a cup of coffee and returned after about an hour, during which time the computer had simulated about two months of weather. The numbers being printed were nothing like the old ones. I immediately suspected a weak vacuum tube or some other computer trouble, which was not uncommon, but before calling for service I decided to see just where the mistake had occurred, knowing that this could speed up the servicing process. Instead of a sudden break, I found that the new values at first repeated the old ones, but soon afterward differed by one and then several units in the last decimal place, and then began to differ in the next to the last place and then in the place before that. In fact, the differences more or less steadily doubled in size every four days or so, until all resemblance with the original output disappeared somewhere in the second month. This was enough to tell me what had happened: the numbers that I had typed in were not the exact original numbers, but were the rounded-off values that had appeared in the original printout. The initial round-off errors were the culprits; they were steadily amplifying until they dominated the solution.\\" (E. N. Lorenz, The Essence of Chaos, U. Washington Press, Seattle (1993), page 134)[8]\\r\\nIn 1963 Lorenz published a theoretical study of this effect in a highly cited, seminal paper called Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow[9][10] (the calculations were performed on a Royal McBee LGP-30 computer).[11][12] Elsewhere he stated:\\r\\nOne meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a sea gull's wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever. The controversy has not yet been settled, but the most recent evidence seems to favor the sea gulls.[12]\\r\\nFollowing suggestions from colleagues, in later speeches and papers Lorenz used the more poetic butterfly. According to Lorenz, when he failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted Does the flap of a butterflys wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas? as a title.[13] Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.[14]\\r\\nThe phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the atmosphere that may ultimately alter the path of a tornado or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly's wings can cause the tornado: in the sense that the flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: domino effect). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly differentbut it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.\\r\\nThe butterfly effect presents an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial conditions for a system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of ensemble forecasting, in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.[15]\\r\\nSome scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial conditions as previously believed.[16] David Orrell argues that the major contributor to weather forecast error is model error, with sensitivity to initial conditions playing a relatively small role.[17][18] Stephen Wolfram also notes that the Lorenz equations are highly simplified and do not contain terms that represent viscous effects; he believes that these terms would tend to damp out small perturbations.[19]\\r\\nRecurrence, the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making complex systems, such as the weather, difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.\\r\\nA dynamical system displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate.[2] The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.\\r\\nIf M is the state space for the map \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle f^{t}}\\r\\n\\r\\n, then \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle f^{t}}\\r\\n\\r\\n displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in M and any Ѵ?>?0, there are y in M, with distance d(. , .) such that \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n<\\r\\nd\\r\\n(\\r\\nx\\r\\n,\\r\\ny\\r\\n)\\r\\n<\\r\\nѴ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle 0<d(x,y)<\\\\delta }\\r\\n\\r\\n and such that\\r\\nfor some positive parameter a.

The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: \\"Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat overstated.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases in semiclassical and quantum physics including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic Kepler problem.[21][22] Some authors have argued that extreme (exponential) dependence on initial conditions is not expected in pure quantum treatments;[23][24] however, the sensitive dependence on initial conditions demonstrated in classical motion is included in the semiclassical treatments developed by Martin Gutzwiller[25] and Delos and co-workers.[26]\\r\\nOther authors suggest that the butterfly effect can be observed in quantum systems. Karkuszewski et al. consider the time evolution of quantum systems which have slightly different Hamiltonians. They investigate the level of sensitivity of quantum systems to small changes in their given Hamiltonians.[27] Poulin et al. presented a quantum algorithm to measure fidelity decay, which \\"measures the rate at which identical initial states diverge when subjected to slightly different dynamics\\". They consider fidelity decay to be \\"the closest quantum analog to the (purely classical) butterfly effect\\".[28] Whereas the classical butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the position and/or velocity of an object in a given Hamiltonian system, the quantum butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the Hamiltonian system with a given initial position and velocity.[29][30] This quantum butterfly effect has been demonstrated experimentally.[31] Quantum and semiclassical treatments of system sensitivity to initial conditions are known as quantum chaos.[23][29]\\r\\nThe journalist Peter Dizikes, writing in The Boston Globe in 2008, notes that popular culture likes the idea of the butterfly effect, but gets it wrong. Whereas Lorenz suggested correctly with his butterfly metaphor that predictability \\"is inherently limited\\", popular culture supposes that each event can be explained by finding the small reasons that caused it. Dizikes explains: \\"It speaks to our larger expectation that the world should be comprehensible ÿ that everything happens for a reason, and that we can pinpoint all those reasons, however small they may be. But nature itself defies this expectation.\\"[32]","input":"Who came up with the butterfly effect theory?"},{"output":"electronic attack (EA)","context":"Electronic warfare (EW) is any action involving the use of the electromagnetic spectrum or directed energy to control the spectrum, attack of an enemy, or impede enemy assaults via the spectrum. The purpose of electronic warfare is to deny the opponent the advantage of, and ensure friendly unimpeded access to, the EM spectrum. EW can be applied from air, sea, land, and space by manned and unmanned systems, and can target humans, communications, radar, or other assets.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMilitary operations are executed in an information environment increasingly complicated by the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum portion of the information environment is referred to as the electromagnetic environment (EME). The recognized need for military forces to have unimpeded access to and use of the electromagnetic environment creates vulnerabilities and opportunities for electronic warfare (EW) in support of military operations.[1]\\r\\nWithin the information operations construct, EW is an element of information warfare; more specifically, it is an element of offensive and defensive counterinformation.[2]\\r\\nNATO has a different and arguably more encompassing and comprehensive approach to EW. A Military Committee conceptual document from 2007 (MCM_0142 Nov 2007 Military Committee Transformation Concept for Future NATO Electronic Warfare) recognised the EME as an operational manoeuvre space and warfighting environment/domain. In NATO, EW is considered to be warfare in the EME. NATO has adopted simplified language which parallel those used in the other warfighting environments like maritime, land and air/space. For example, Electronic Attack is offensive use of EM energy. ED is electronic defence and ES electronic surveillance. The use of the traditional NATO EW measures (ECM, EPM and ESM) has been retained as they contribute to and support EA, ED and ES. Besides EW, other EM operations include ISTAR and SIGINT. Subsequently NATO has issued EW Policy and Doctrine and is addressing the other NATO defence lines of development.\\r\\nElectronic warfare is any military action involving the use of the EM spectrum to include directed energy (DE) to control the EM spectrum or to attack an enemy. This is not limited to radio or radar frequencies but includes IR, visible, ultraviolet, and other less used portions of the EM spectrum. This includes self-protection, standoff, and escort jamming, and antiradiation attacks. EW is a specialized tool that enhances many air and space functions at multiple levels of conflict.[2]\\r\\nThe purpose of EW is to deny the opponent an advantage in the EM spectrum and ensure friendly unimpeded access to the EM spectrum portion of the information environment. EW can be applied from air, sea, land, and space by manned and unmanned systems. EW is employed to support military operations involving various levels of detection, denial, deception, disruption, degradation, protection, and destruction.[1]\\r\\nEW contributes to the success of information operations (IO) by using offensive and defensive tactics and techniques in a variety of combinations to shape, disrupt, and exploit adversarial use of the EM spectrum while protecting friendly freedom of action in that spectrum. Expanding reliance on the EM spectrum increases both the potential and the challenges of EW in information operations. All of the core, supporting, and related information operations capabilities either directly use EW or indirectly benefit from EW.[2]\\r\\nThe principal EW activities have been developed over time to exploit the opportunities and vulnerabilities that are inherent in the physics of EM energy. Activities used in EW include: electro-optical, infrared and radio frequency countermeasures; EM compatibility and deception; communications jamming, radar jamming and anti-jamming; electronic masking, probing, reconnaissance, and intelligence; electronics security; EW reprogramming; emission control; spectrum management; and wartime reserve modes.[1][2]\\r\\nElectronic warfare includes three major subdivisions: electronic attack (EA), electronic protection (EP), and electronic warfare support (ES).[1]\\r\\nElectronic attack (EA) (previously known as Electronic Counter Measures (ECM)) involves the use of EM energy, directed energy, or anti-radiation weapons to attack personnel, facilities, or equipment with the intent of degrading, neutralizing, or destroying enemy combat capability including human life. In the case of EM energy, this action is referred to as jamming and can be performed on communications systems (see Radio jamming) or radar systems (see Radar jamming and deception).\\r\\nElectronic Protection (EP) (previously known as electronic protective measures (EPM) or electronic counter countermeasures (ECCM)) involves actions taken to protect personnel, facilities, and equipment from any effects of friendly or enemy use of the electromagnetic spectrum that degrade, neutralize, or destroy friendly combat capability. Jamming is not part of EP, it is an EA measure.\\r\\nThe use of flare rejection logic on an Infrared homing missile to counter an adversarys use of flares is EP. While defensive EA actions and EP both protect personnel, facilities, capabilities, and equipment, EP protects from the effects of EA (friendly and/or adversary). Other examples of EP include spread spectrum technologies, use of Joint Restricted Frequency List (JRFL), emissions control (EMCON), and low observability or \\"stealth\\".[1]\\r\\nAn Electronic Warfare Self Protection (EWSP) is a suite of countermeasure systems fitted primarily to aircraft for the purpose of protecting the aircraft from weapons fire and can include among others: DIRCM (protects against IR missiles), Infrared countermeasures (protects against IR missiles), Chaff (protects against RADAR guided missiles), DRFM Decoys (Protects against Radar guided missiles), Flare (protects against IR missiles).\\r\\nAn Electronic Warfare Tactics Range (EWTR) is a practice range which provides for the training of aircrew in electronic warfare. There are two such ranges in Europe; one at RAF Spadeadam in the United Kingdom and the POLYGON range in Germany and France. EWTRs are equipped with ground-based equipment to simulate electronic warfare threats that aircrew might encounter on missions.\\r\\nAntifragile EW is a step beyond standard EP, occurring when a communications link being jammed actually increases in capability as a result of a jamming attack, although this is only possible under certain circumstances such as reactive forms of jamming.[3]\\r\\nElectronic Warfare Support (ES), is the subdivision of EW involving actions tasked by, or under direct control of, an operational commander to search for, intercept, identify, and locate or localize sources of intentional and unintentional radiated electromagnetic (EM) energy for the purpose of immediate threat recognition, targeting, planning, and conduct of future operations.[1] These measures begin with systems designed and operators trained to make Electronic Intercepts (ELINT) and then classification and analysis broadly known as Signals intelligence from such detection to return information and perhaps actionable intelligence (e.g. a ship's identification from unique characteristics of a specific radar) to the commander.\\r\\nThe overlapping discipline, signals intelligence (SIGINT) is the related process of analyzing and identifying the intercepted frequencies (e.g. as a mobile phone or radar). SIGINT is broken into three categories: ELINT, COMINT, and FISINT. the parameters of intercepted txn are-: communication equipment-: freq, bandwidth, modulation, polarisation etc. The distinction between intelligence and electronic warfare support (ES) is determined by who tasks or controls the collection assets, what they are tasked to provide, and for what purpose they are tasked. Electronic warfare support is achieved by assets tasked or controlled by an operational commander. The purpose of ES tasking is immediate threat recognition, targeting, planning and conduct of future operations, and other tactical actions such as threat avoidance and homing. However, the same assets and resources that are tasked with ES can simultaneously collect intelligence that meets other collection requirements.[1]\\r\\nWhere these activities are under the control of an operational commander and being applied for the purpose of situational awareness, threat recognition, or EM targeting, they also serve the purpose of Electronic Warfare surveillance (ES).\\r\\nIn the 2007 Operation Orchard Israeli attack on a suspected Syrian nuclear weapons site, the Israel Air Force used electronic warfare to take control of Syrian airspace prior to the attack.[4] Israeli electronic warfare (EW) systems took over Syrias air defense systems, feeding them a false sky-picture while Israel Air Force jets crossed much of Syria, bombed their targets and returned.[5]\\r\\nIn February 2015 the Russian army received their first set of the multifunctional electronic warfare system, known as Borisoglebsk 2.[6][7][8] Svenska Dagbladet claimed its initial usage caused concern within NATO.[9] A Russian blog describes Borisoglebsk 2 as \\"The 'Borisoglebsk-2' when compared to its predecessors has better technical characteristics: wider frequency bandwidth for conducting radar collection and jamming, faster scanning times of the frequency spectrum, and higher precision when identifying the location and source of radar emissions, and increased capacity for suppression.\\" [10]\\r\\nElectronic Warfare Systems:\\r\\nHistoric:\\r\\nU.S. specific:","input":"What are the three division of electronic warfare?"},{"output":"6,500ÿ6,200 BC","context":"Doggerland was an area now beneath the southern North Sea that connected Great Britain to continental Europe during and after the last glacial period.

Geological surveys have suggested that it stretched from Britain's east coast to the Netherlands and the western coasts of Germany and the peninsula of Jutland.[1] It was probably a rich habitat with human habitation in the Mesolithic period,[2] although rising sea levels gradually reduced it to low-lying islands before its final submergence, possibly following a tsunami caused by the Storegga Slide.[3]\\r\\nThe archaeological potential of the area had first been identified in the early 20th century, but interest intensified in 1931 when a fishing trawler operating east of the Wash dragged up a barbed antler point that was subsequently dated to a time when the area was tundra. Vessels have dragged up remains of mammoth, lion and other animals, as well as a few prehistoric tools and weapons.[4]\\r\\nDoggerland was named after the Dogger Bank, which in turn was named after the 17th century Dutch fishing boats called doggers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the middle Pleistocene, Britain was a peninsula of Europe, connected by the massive chalk WealdÿArtois Anticline across the Straits of Dover. During the Anglian glaciation, approximately 450,000 years ago, an ice sheet filled much of the North Sea, with a large proglacial lake in the southern part fed by the Rhine, Scheldt and Thames river systems. The catastrophic overflow of this lake carved a channel through the anticline, leading to the formation of the Channel River, which carried the combined Scheldt and Thames to the Atlantic. This probably created the potential for Britain to become isolated from the continent during periods of high sea level, although some scientists argue that the final break did not occur until a second ice-dammed lake overflowed during the MIS8 or MIS6 glaciations, around 340,000 or 240,000 years ago.[5]\\r\\nDuring the most recent glaciation of the Last Glacial Maximum, which ended around 18,000 years ago, the North Sea and much of the British Isles were covered with glacial ice and the sea level was about 120?m (390?ft) lower. Subsequently, the climate became warmer and during the Late Glacial Maximum around 12,000 BC Britain, as well as much of the North Sea and English Channel, was an expanse of low-lying tundra.[6]\\r\\nEvidence, including the contours of the present seabed, indicates that after the first main Ice Age, the watershed between the North Sea and English Channel extended east from East Anglia then south-east to the Hook of Holland, rather than across the Strait of Dover. The Seine, Thames, Meuse, Scheldt and Rhine rivers joined and flowed west along the English Channel as a wide slow river before eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean.[2][6] At about 10,000?BC the north-facing coastal area of Doggerland had a coastline of lagoons, saltmarshes, mudflats and beaches as well as inland streams, rivers, marshes and lakes. It may have been the richest hunting, fowling and fishing ground in Europe in the Mesolithic period.[2][7]\\r\\nOne big river system found by 3D seismic survey, undertaken by the Birmingham \\"North Sea Palaeolandscapes Project,\\" was the \\"Shotton River\\", which drained the south-east part of the Dogger Bank hill area into the east end of the Outer Silver Pit lake. It is named after Birmingham geologist Frederick William Shotton.\\r\\nAs ice melted at the end of the last glacial period of the current ice age, sea levels rose and the land began to tilt in an isostatic adjustment as the huge weight of ice lessened. Doggerland eventually became submerged, cutting off what was previously the British peninsula from the European mainland by around 6500?BC.[6][9] The Dogger Bank, an upland area of Doggerland, remained an island until at least 5000?BC.[6][9] Key stages are now believed to have included the gradual evolution of a large tidal bay between eastern England and Dogger Bank by 9000?BC and a rapid sea-level rise thereafter, leading to Dogger Bank becoming an island and Great Britain becoming physically disconnected from the continent.[10]\\r\\nA recent hypothesis postulates that much of the remaining coastal land was flooded by a megatsunami around 6200 BC, caused by a submarine landslide off the coast of Norway known as the Storegga Slide. This suggests: \\"that the Storegga Slide tsunami would have had a catastrophic impact on the contemporary coastal Mesolithic population.... Britain finally became separated from the continent and in cultural terms, the Mesolithic there goes its own way.\\"[10] A study published in 2014 suggested that the only remaining parts of Doggerland at the time of the Storegga Slide were low-lying islands, but supported the view that the area had been abandoned at about the same time as the tsunamis.[3]\\r\\nAnother view speculates that the Storegga tsunami devastated Doggerland but then ebbed back into the sea, and that later Lake Agassiz (in North America) burst releasing so much fresh water that sea levels over about two years rose to flood much of Doggerland and make Britain an island.[11]\\r\\nThe prehistoric existence of what is now known as Doggerland was established in the late 19th century. H. G. Wells referred to the concept in his short story A Story of the Stone Age of 1897, set in \\"a time when one might have walked dryshod from France (as we call it now) to England, and when a broad and sluggish Thames flowed through its marshes to meet its father Rhine, flowing through a wide and level country that is under water in these latter days, and which we know by the name of the North Sea...Fifty thousand years ago it was, fifty thousand years?if the reckoning of geologists is correct\\", though most of the action seems to occur in what is now Surrey and Kent, but stretching out to Doggerland.[12]\\r\\nThe remains of plants brought to the surface from Dogger Bank were studied in 1913 by paleobiologist Clement Reid, and the remains of animals and worked flints from the Neolithic period had also been found.[13] In his book The Antiquity of Man of 1915, anatomist Sir Arthur Keith discussed the archaeological potential of the area.[13] In 1931, the trawler Colinda hauled up a lump of peat whilst fishing near the Ower Bank, 40 kilometres (25?mi) east of Norfolk. The peat was found to contain a barbed antler point, possibly used as a harpoon or fish spear, 220 millimetres (8.5?in) long, which dated from between 4,000 and 10,000?BC when the area was tundra.[2][7]\\r\\nInterest was reinvigorated in the 1990s by Bryony Coles, who named the area \\"Doggerland\\" (\\"after the great banks in the southern North Sea\\")[7] and produced speculative maps of the area.[7][14] Although she recognised that the current relief of the southern North Sea seabed is not a sound guide to the topography of Doggerland,[14] this topography has more recently begun to be reconstructed more authoritatively using seismic survey data obtained from oil exploration. Between 2003 and 2007 a team at the University of Birmingham led by Vince Gaffney and Ken Thomson mapped around 23,000 square kilometres (8,900 square miles) of the Early Holocene landscape, using seismic data provided for research by Petroleum Geo-Services, as part of the work of the University of Birmingham North Sea Palaeolandscapes Project.[15] The results of this study were published as a technical monograph and a popular book on the history and archaeology of Doggerland[16][17][18]\\r\\nA skull fragment of a Neanderthal, dated at over 40,000 years old, was recovered from material dredged from the Middeldiep, some 16 kilometres (10?mi) off the coast of Zeeland, and exhibited in Leiden in 2009.[19] In March 2010 it was reported that recognition of the potential archaeological importance of the area could affect the future development of offshore wind farms.[20]\\r\\nIn July 2012, the results of study of Doggerland by the universities of Birmingham, St Andrews, Dundee, and Aberdeen, including artefacts survey results, were displayed at the Royal Society summer exhibition in London.[21] Richard Bates of St Andrews University said:[21]\\r\\nWe have speculated for years on the lost land's existence from bones dredged by fishermen all over the North Sea, but it's only since working with oil companies in the last few years that we have been able to re-create what this lost land looked like.... We have now been able to model its flora and fauna, build up a picture of the ancient people that lived there and begin to understand some of the dramatic events that subsequently changed the land, including the sea rising and a devastating tsunami.\\r\\nSince 2015, the University of Bradford's project Europe's Lost Frontiers project has continued mapping the prehistoric landscapes of Doggerland and has used this these data to direct a programme of extensive coring of marine palaeochannels. Sediment from the cores has provided sedimentary DNA as well as conventional environmental data and these will be used in a major computational modelling programme replicating colonisation of the submerged landscape.[22][23]","input":"When did britain become separated from the continent?"},{"output":"in warm, shallow water with low water flow","context":"Coral bleaching?occurs when coral polyps expel algae that live inside their tissues. Normally, coral polyps live in an endosymbiotic relationship with the algae and that relationship is crucial for the coral and hence for the health of the whole reef.[1] Bleached corals might continue to live for some time. But as the algae provide the coral with up to 90% of its energy, after expelling the algae the coral begins to starve.[2] After bleaching, some corals may recover, while some die. Above-average sea water temperatures caused by global warming have been identified as a leading cause for coral bleaching worldwide.[2] Between 2014 and 2016, the longest global bleaching events ever were recorded. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, these bleaching events killed coral on an unprecedented scale. In 2016, bleaching of coral on the Great Barrier Reef killed between 29 and 50 percent of the reef's coral.[3][4][5] In 2017, the bleaching further expanded to areas of the reef that were previously spared, such as the central one.[6][7] The average interval between bleaching events has halved between 1980 and 2016.[8]\\r\\nThe corals that form the great reef ecosystems of tropical seas depend upon a symbiotic relationship with algae-like single-celled flagellate protozoa called zooxanthellae that live within their tissues and give the coral its coloration. The zooxanthellae provide the coral with nutrients through photosynthesis, a crucial factor in the clear and nutrient-poor tropical waters. In exchange, the coral provide the zooxanthellae with the carbon dioxide and ammonium needed for photosynthesis. Negative environmental conditions thwart the coral's ability to provide for the zooxanthellae's needs. To ensure short-term survival, the coral-polyp then expels the zooxanthellae. This leads to a lighter or completely white appearance, hence the term \\"bleached\\".[9] As the zooxanthellae provide up to 90% of the coral's energy needs through products of photosynthesis, after expelling, the coral may begin to starve.\\r\\nCoral can survive short-term disturbances, but if the conditions that lead to the expulsion of the zooxanthellae persist, the coral's chances of survival diminish. In order to recover from bleaching, the zooxanthellae have to re-enter the tissues of the coral polyps and restart photosynthesis to sustain the coral as a whole and the ecosystem that depends on it.[10] If the coral polyps die of starvation after bleaching, they will decay. The hard coral species will then leave behind their calcium carbonate skeletons, which will be taken over by algae, effectively blocking coral re-growth. Eventually, the coral skeletons will erode, causing the reef structure to collapse.\\r\\nCoral bleaching may be caused by a number of factors. While localized triggers lead to localized bleaching, the large scale coral bleaching events of the recent years have been triggered by increased sea surface temperatures.[11] Coral reefs located in warm, shallow water with low water flow have been more affected than reefs located in areas with higher water flow.[12]\\r\\nElevated sea water temperatures are the main cause of mass bleaching events.[33] Sixty major episodes of coral bleaching have occurred between 1979 and 1990,[34][35] with the associated coral mortality affecting reefs in every part of the world. In 2016, the longest coral bleaching event was recorded.[36] The longest and most destructive coral bleaching event was because of the El Ni?o that occurred from 2014-2017.[37] During this time, over 70% of the coral reefs around the world have become damaged.[37]\\r\\nFactors that influence the outcome of a bleaching event include stress-resistance which reduces bleaching, tolerance to the absence of zooxanthellae, and how quickly new coral grows to replace the dead. Due to the patchy nature of bleaching, local climatic conditions such as shade or a stream of cooler water can reduce bleaching incidence.[38] Coral and zooxanthellae health and genetics also influence bleaching.[38]\\r\\nLarge coral colonies such as Porites are able to withstand extreme temperature shocks, while fragile branching corals such Acropora are far more susceptible to stress following a temperature change.[39] Corals consistently exposed to low stress levels may be more resistant to bleaching.[40][41]\\r\\nScientists believe that the oldest known bleaching was that of the Late Devonian (Frasnian/Famennian), also triggered by the rise of sea surface temperatures. It resulted in the demise of the largest coral reefs in the Earth's history.[42]\\r\\nIn the 2012ÿ2040 period, coral reefs are expected to experience more frequent bleaching events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sees this as the greatest threat to the world's reef systems.[43][44][45][46] Coral reefs worldwide were lost by 19%, and 60% of the remaining reefs are at immediate risk of being lost. There are a few ways to tell the impacts of coral bleaching on reefs. First by the coral cover, the more coral that is covering the ground the less of an impact bleaching had. Second, coral abundance, which is the number of different living species on the coral reef. (Shidqi et al. 2017)\\r\\nThe Great Barrier Reef along the coast of Australia experienced bleaching events in 1980, 1982, 1992, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2016 and 2017.[46][47] Some locations suffered severe damage, with up to 90% mortality.[48] The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54% respectively of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached.[49][50] However coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals.[51] An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes.[52] A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans. These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef. The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas. In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral. The highest coral death and reef habitat loss was inshore and mid-self reefs around Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay.[53] The IPCC's moderate warming scenarios (B1 to A1T, 2?C by 2100, IPCC, 2007, Table SPM.3, p.?13[54]) forecast that corals on the Great Barrier Reef are very likely to regularly experience summer temperatures high enough to induce bleaching.[49]\\r\\nMajor bleaching occurred in Hawaiian coral reefs in 1996 and in 2002.[55] In 2014, biologists from the University of Queensland observed the first mass bleaching event, and attributed it to The Blob.[56] In 2014 and 2015, a survey in Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve on Oahu found 47% of the corals suffering from coral bleaching and close to 10% of the corals dying.[57]\\r\\nAccording to a 2017 Japanese government report, almost 75% of Japan's largest coral reef in Okinawa has died from bleaching.[58]\\r\\nCoral reef provinces have been permanently damaged by warm sea temperatures, most severely in the Indian Ocean. Up to 90% of coral cover has been lost in the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Tanzania and in the Seychelles during the massive 1997-98 bleaching event.[59]\\r\\nMore than 60% of the coral in the Maldives has suffered from bleaching in 2016.[60]\\r\\nThailand experienced a severe mass bleaching in 2010 which affected 70% of the coral in the Andaman Sea. Between 30% and 95% of the bleached coral died.[61]\\r\\nIn 2017 there was a study done on two islands in Indonesia to see how their coral cover was. One of the places was Melinjo Islands and the other was Saktu Islands. In Saktu Island the lifeform conditions were categorized as bad, with an average coral cover of 22.3%. In Melinjo Islands the lifeform conditions were categorized as bad, with an average coral cover of 22.2%. (Shidqi et al. 2017)\\r\\nIn South Florida, a 2016 survey of large corals from Key Biscayne to Fort Lauderdale found that about 66% of the corals were dead or reduced to less than half of their live tissue.[62]\\r\\nThe first recorded mass bleaching event that took place in the Belize Barrier Reef was in 1998, where sea level temperatures reached up to 31.5?C (88.7?F) from 10 August to 14 October.[63] For a few days, Hurricane Mitch brought in stormy weather on October 27 but only reduced temperatures by 1 degree or less. During this time period, mass bleaching in the fore-reef and lagoon occurred. While some fore reef colonies suffered some damage, coral mortality in the lagoon was catastrophic.[63]\\r\\nThe most prevalent coral in the reefs of Belize in 1998 was the lettuce coral, Agaricia tenuifolia. On 22 and 23 October, surveys were conducted at two sites and the findings were devastating. Virtually all the living coral was bleached white and their skeletons indicated that they had died recently. At the lagoon floor, complete bleaching was evident among Agaricia tenuifolia. Furthermore, surveys done in 1999 and 2000 showed a near total mortality of Agaricia tenuifolia at all depths. Similar patterns occurred in other coral species as well. Measurements on water turbidity suggest that these mortalities were attributed to rising water temperatures rather than solar radiation.[63]\\r\\nHard coral cover on reefs in the Caribbean have declined by an estimated 80%, from an average of 50% cover in the 1970s to only about 10% cover in the early 2000s.[64] A 2013 study to follow up on a mass bleaching event in Tobago from 2010 showed that after only 1 year, the majority of the dominant species declined by about 62% while coral abundance declined by about 50%. However, between 2011 and 2013, coral cover increased for 10 of the 26 dominant species but declined for 5 other populations.[65]\\r\\nCoral in the south Red Sea does not bleach despite summer water temperatures up to 34?C (93?F).[40][66] Coral bleaching in the Red Sea is more common in the northern section of the reefs, the southern part of the reef has been plagued by coral eating starfish, dynamite fishing and human impacts on the environment. In 1988 there was a massive bleaching event that affected the reefs in Saudi Arabia and in Sudan, the southern reefs were more resilient and affected them very little. Previously it was thought that the North suffers more from coral bleaching but they show a fast turnover of coral and the southern reef was thought to not suffer from bleaching as harshly, they show more consistency. However, new research shows where the south reef should be bigger and healthier than the north it was not. This is believed to be because of major disturbances in recent history from bleaching events, and coral eating starfish.[67] In 2010, coral bleaching occurred in Saudi Arabia and Sudan, where the temperature rose 10 to 11 degrees. Certain taxa experienced 80% to 100% of their colonies bleaching, while some showed on average 20% of that taxa bleaching.[68]\\r\\nAccording to Brian Skoloff of The Christian Science Monitor, \\"If the reefs vanished, experts say, hunger, poverty and political instability could ensue.\\"[69] Since countless sea life depend on the reefs for shelter and protection from predators, the extinction of the reefs would ultimately create a domino effect that would trickle down to the many human societies that depend on those fish for food and livelihood. There has been a 44% decline over the last 20 years in the Florida Keys, and up to 80% in the Caribbean alone.[70]\\r\\nCoral reefs provide various ecosystem services, one of which is being a natural fishery, as many frequently consumed commercial fish spawn or live out their juvenile lives in coral reefs around the tropics.[71][72][73] Thus, reefs are a popular fishing site and are an important source of income for fishers, especially small, local fisheries.[73] As coral reef habitat decreases due to bleaching, reef associated fish populations also decrease, which affects fishing opportunities.[71] A model from one study by Speers et al. calculated direct losses to fisheries from decreased coral cover to be around $49 ÿ $69 billion, if human societies continue to emit high levels of greenhouse gases.[71] But, these losses could be reduced for a consumer surplus benefit of about $14 ÿ $20 billion, if societies chose to emit a lower level of greenhouse gases instead.[71] These economic losses also have important political implications, as they fall disproportionately on developing countries where the reefs are located, namely in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean.[71][73][74] It would cost more for countries in these areas to respond to coral reef loss as they would need to turn to different sources of income and food, in addition to losing other ecosystem services such as ecotourism.[72][74] A study completed by Chen et al. suggested that the commercial value of reefs decreases by almost 4% every time coral cover decreases by 1% because of losses in ecotourism and other potential outdoor recreational activities.[72]\\r\\nCoral reefs also act as a protective barrier for coastlines by reducing wave impact, which lowers the damage from storms, erosions, and flooding. Countries that lose this natural protection will lose more money because of the increased susceptibility of storms. This indirect cost, combined with the lost revenue in tourism, will result in enormous economic effects.[9]\\r\\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitors for bleaching \\"hot spots\\", areas where sea surface temperature rises 1?C or more above the long-term monthly average. The \\"hot spots\\" are the location in which thermal stress is measured and with the development of Degree Heating Week (DHW), the coral reef's thermal stress is monitored.[75][76] Global coral bleaching is being detected earlier due to the satellite remote sensing the rise of sea temperatures.[75][77] It is necessary to monitor the high temperatures because coral bleaching events are affecting coral reef reproduction and normal growth capacity, as well as it weakening corals, eventually leading to their mortality.[77] This system detected the worldwide 1998 bleaching event,[78][79] that corresponded to the 1997ÿ98 El Ni?o event.[80] Currently, 190 reef sites around the globe are monitored by the NOAA, and send alerts to research scientists and reef managers via NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) website.[81] By monitoring the warming of sea temperatures, the early warnings of coral bleaching, alerts reef managers to prepare and draw awareness to future bleaching events.[81] The first mass global bleaching events were recorded in 1998 and 2010, which was when the El Ni?o caused the oceans temperatures to rise and worsened the corals living conditions.[37] The 2014-2017 El Ni?o was recorded to be the longest and most damaging to the corals, which harmed over 70% of our coral reefs.[37] Over two thirds of the Great Barrier Reef have been reported to be bleached or dead.[37]\\r\\nIncreasing ocean acidification due to rises in carbon dioxide levels exacerbates the bleaching effects of thermal stress. Acidification affects the corals' ability to create calcareous skeletons, essential to their survival.[82] This is because ocean acidification decreases the amount of carbonate ion in the water, making it more difficult for corals to absorb the calcium carbonate they need for the skeleton. As a result, the resilience of reefs goes down, while it becomes easier for them to erode and dissolve.[83] In addition, the increase in CO2 allows herbivore overfishing and nutrification to change coral-dominated ecosystems to algal-dominated ecosystems.[84] A recent study from the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future found that with the combination of acidification and temperature rises, the levels of CO2 could become too high for coral to survive in as little as 50 years.[82]\\r\\nInfectious bacteria of the species Vibrio shiloi are the bleaching agent of Oculina patagonica in the Mediterranean Sea, causing this effect by attacking the zooxanthellae.[85][86][87] V. shiloi is infectious only during warm periods. Elevated temperature increases the virulence of V. shiloi, which then become able to adhere to a beta-galactoside-containing receptor in the surface mucus of the host coral.[86][88] V. shiloi then penetrates the coral's epidermis, multiplies, and produces both heat-stable and heat-sensitive toxins, which affect zooxanthellae by inhibiting photosynthesis and causing lysis.\\r\\nDuring the summer of 2003, coral reefs in the Mediterranean Sea appeared to gain resistance to the pathogen, and further infection was not observed.[89] The main hypothesis for the emerged resistance is the presence of symbiotic communities of protective bacteria living in the corals. The bacterial species capable of lysing V. shiloi had not been identified as of 2011.\\r\\nIn 2010, researchers at Penn State discovered corals that were thriving while using an unusual species of symbiotic algae in the warm waters of the Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean. Normal zooxanthellae cannot withstand temperatures as high as was there, so this finding was unexpected. This gives researchers hope that with rising temperatures due to global warming, coral reefs will develop tolerance for different species of symbiotic algae that are resistant to high temperature, and can live within the reefs.[90][91] In 2010, researchers from Stanford University also found corals around the Samoan Islands that experience a drastic temperature increase for about four hours a day during low tide. The corals do not bleach or die regardless of the high heat increase. Studies showed that the corals off the coast of Ofu Island near America Samoa have become trained to withstand the high temperatures. Researchers are now asking a new question: can we condition corals, that are not from this area, in this manner and slowly introduce them to higher temperatures for short periods of time and make them more resilient against rising ocean temperatures.[92]\\r\\nAfter corals experience a bleaching event to increased temperature stress some reefs are able to return to their original, pre-bleaching state.[93][94] Reefs either recover from bleaching, where they are recolonized by zooxanthellae, or they experience a regime shift, where previously flourishing coral reefs are taken over by thick layers of macroalgae.[95] This inhibits further coral growth because the algae produces antifouling compounds to deter settlement and competes with corals for space and light. As a result, macroalgae forms stable communities that make it difficult for corals to grow again. Reefs will then be more susceptible to other issues, such as declining water quality and removal of herbivore fish, because coral growth is weaker.[11] Discovering what causes reefs to be resilient or recover from bleaching events is of primary importance because it helps inform conservation efforts and protect coral more effectively.\\r\\nCorals have shown to be resilient to short-term disturbances. Recovery has been shown in after storm disturbance and crown of thorns starfish invasions.[93] Fish species tend to fare better following reef disturbance than coral species as corals show limited recovery and reef fish assemblages have shown little change as a result of short-term disturbances.[93] In contrast, fish assemblages in reefs that experience bleaching exhibit potentially damaging changes. One study by Bellwood et al. notes that while species richness, diversity, and abundance did not change, fish assemblages contained more generalist species and less coral dependent species.[93] Responses to coral bleaching are diverse between reef fish species, based on what resources are affected.[96] Rising sea temperature and coral bleaching do not directly impact adult fish mortality, but there are many indirect consequences of both.[96] Coral-associated fish populations tend to be in decline due to habitat loss; however, some herbivorous fish populations have seen a drastic increase due to the increase of algae colonization on dead coral.[96] Studies note that better methods are needed to measure the effects of disturbance on the resilience of corals.[93][97]\\r\\nUntil recently, the factors mediating the recovery of coral reefs from bleaching were not well studied. Research by Graham et al. (2005) studied 21 reefs around Seychelles in the Indo-Pacific in order to document the long-term effects of coral bleaching.[94] After the loss of more than 90% of corals due to bleaching in 1998 around 50% of the reefs recovered and roughly 40% of the reefs experienced regime shifts to macroalgae dominated compositions.[94] After an assessment of factors influencing the probability of recovery, the study identified five major factors: density of juvenile corals, initial structural complexity, water depth, biomass of herbivorous fishes, and nutrient conditions on the reef.[94] Overall, resilience was seen most in coral reef systems that were structurally complex and in deeper water.[94]\\r\\nThe ecological roles and functional groups of species also play a role in the recovery of regime shifting potential in reef systems. Coral reefs are affected by bioeroding, scraping, and grazing fish species. Bioeroding species remove dead corals, scraping species remove algae and sediment to further future growth, grazing species remove algae.[99] The presence of each type of species can influence the ability for normal levels of coral recruitment which is an important part of coral recovery.[99] Lowered numbers of grazing species after coral bleaching in the Caribbean has been likened to sea-urchin-dominated systems which do not undergo regime shifts to fleshy macroalgae dominated conditions.[95]\\r\\nThere is always the possibility of unobservable changes, or cryptic losses or resilience, in a coral community's ability to perform ecological processes.[93][99] These cryptic losses can result in unforeseen regime changes or ecological flips.[93] More detailed methods for determining the health of coral reefs that take into account long-term changes to the coral ecosystems and better-informed conservation policies are necessary to protect coral reefs in the years to come.[93][94][97][99]\\r\\nResearch is being done to help slow down the mortality rate of corals. Worldwide Projects are being completed to help replenish and restore our coral reefs. The population of corals is rapidly declining, so scientists are doing experiments in coral growth and research tanks to help replenish the population of corals.[37] These research tanks mimic the coral reefs natural environment in the ocean.[37]They are growing corals in these tanks to use for their experiments, so no more corals are being harmed or taken from the ocean.[37] They are also transplanting the successfully grown corals from the research tanks and putting them into the areas of the ocean where the reefs are dying out.[37] An experiment is being done in some coral growth and research tanks by Ruth Gates and Madelaine Van Oppen.[37]They are trying to make \\"super corals\\" that can withstand some of the environmental factors that the corals are currently dying from.[37] Van Oppen is also working on developing a type of algae that will have a symbiotic relationship with corals and can withstand water temperature fluctuations for long periods of time.[37] This project may be helping to replenish our reefs, but the growing process of corals in research tanks is very time consuming.[37] It can take at least 10 years for the corals to fully grow and mature enough to where they will be able to breed.[37]\\r\\nCoral reefs provide goods and services to an estimated quarter of all ocean species. [100] Experts estimate that coral reef services are worth up to $1.2 million per hectare which translates to an average of $172 billion per year.[101] The benefits of coral reefs include providing physical structures such as coastal shoreline protection, biotic services within and between ecosystems, biogeochemical services such as maintaining nitrogen levels in the ocean, climate records, and recreational and commercial (tourism) services.[102] Coral reefs are one of the best marine ecosystems to use to as a food source.[32] The coral reefs are also the perfect habitat for rare and economically important species of tropical fish, as they provide the perfect area for fish to breed and create nurseries in.[32] If the populations of the fish and corals in the reef are high, then we can use the area as a place to gather food and things with medicinal properties, which also helps create jobs for people who can collect these specimens.[32] The reefs also have some cultural importance in specific regions around the world.[32]\\r\\nIn 2010, the Convention on Biological Diversity's (CBD) Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 created twenty distinct targets for sustainable development for post-2015. Target 10 indicates the goal of minimizing \\"anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs\\".[103] Two programs were looked at, one that reduces coral reef loss by 50% that has a capital cost of $684 million and a recurrent cost of $81 million. The other program reduces coral reef loss by 80% and has a capital cost of $1,036 million with recurring costs of $130 million. CBD acknowledges that they may be underestimating the costs and resources needed to achieve this target due to lack of relevant data but nonetheless, the cost-benefit analysis shows that the benefits outweigh the costs by a great enough amount for both programs (Benefit Cost Ratio of 95.3 and 98.5) that \\"there is ample scope to increase outlays on coral protection and still achieve a benefit to cost ratio that is well over one\\".[103]","input":"Where is coral bleaching most likely to occur?"},{"output":"Bronx County","context":"","input":"What county is the bronx in new york?"},{"output":"1,237","context":"Buffalo Wild Wings (originally, Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck,[2] thus the numeronym \\"BW3\\") is an American casual dining restaurant and sports bar franchise in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, which specializes in Buffalo wings and sauces.\\r\\nAs of June 2017, it had 1,237 locations (625 directly owned by the company, and 612 franchised locations) across all 50 U.S. states and DC.[3] An alternate nickname in recent usage by the company is B-Dubs.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBuffalo Wild Wings was founded in 1982 by Jim Disbrow, Scott Lowery, and Bernard Spencer. Disbrow, Lowery, and Spencer came up with the idea one weekend when they got together in Kent, Ohio, for Disbrow to judge an amateur figure skating competition at Kent State University in 1980. They decided to open up their own restaurant, first in Columbus, Ohio, and then in Westerville, Ohio one year later.[6]\\r\\nOriginally called Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck,[7] from which the abbreviation bw-3 was created (the third W was for the beef on weck sandwich, a staple of the Buffalo region), in 1990 Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck began to franchise. In 1998, the name was changed to Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar.[8]\\r\\nThe corporate headquarters was located in Cincinnati, Ohio until 1997 when it moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota.[9]\\r\\nIn 2010, the company announced an expansion into Canada.[10] In 2015, Buffalo Wild Wings expanded in the United Arab Emirates when it opened a restaurant in Dubai.[11]\\r\\nThe chain is best known for Buffalo-style chicken wings along with over a dozen dipping sauces, as well as a complement of other items such as chicken tenders and legs. The chain's menu also features appetizers, burgers, tacos, salads, and desserts, along with beer, wine, and other beverages. They are known for their famous \\"Blazin Wing Challenge.\\" They challenge customers to eat 12 of their hottest wings under six minutes. The winners receive a free T-shirt and get their picture on their wall of fame. The restaurants feature an open layout with a bar area and patio seating flanked by over 50 televisions and media screens.[12] Starting in 2016, the new restaurants being built follow a new type of layout that gives the guests the feeling as if they were actually in a sports stadium. Server uniforms consist of gray shorts and jerseys with the number 82, signifying the year that the chain was established in 1982.[13] Not only is the chain attributable to its famous wings, beer, and sports, but it is also recognized as a big partner with the organization the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Multiple times a year, the company does fundraisers and accepts monetary donations that are later given to the Boys and Girls Club that allows them to participate in extracurricular and sporting events.\\r\\nOn September 11th of 2017, customers at the Eastvale, California franchise complained that an employee muted the sound for the United States National Anthem at the start of the Monday Night Football game claiming that it was controversial and that it was not company policy to play it.

It is the fourth largest island in the Bahamas island chain of approximately 700 islands and 2,400 cays. The island is approximately 153 kilometres (95?mi) long west to east and 24 kilometres (15?mi) at its widest point north to south. Administratively, the island consists of the Freeport Bonded Area and the districts of East Grand Bahama and West Grand Bahama.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish gave the island the name Gran Bajamar, meaning \\"Great Shallows\\", and what the eventual name of the Bahamas islands as a whole is derived from. However, the Lucayan (pre-Columbian) name for the island was Bahama.[2] Grand Bahama's existence for almost two centuries was largely governed by the nature of these \\"great shallows\\" - the coral reefs surrounding the island were treacherous, and repelled its Spanish claimants (who largely left it alone apart from infrequent en route stops by ships for provisions) while attracting pirates, who would lure ships onto the reefs where they would run aground and be plundered. The Spaniards took little interest in the island after enslaving the native Lucayan inhabitants.[3]\\r\\nThe islands were claimed by Great Britain in 1670. Piracy continued to thrive for at least half a century after the British takeover, though the problem was eventually brought under control.\\r\\nGrand Bahama remained relatively quiet until the mid-19th century, with only around 200-400 regular inhabitants in the capital, West End. In 1834, the towns of Pinders Point, Russell Town and Williams Town were established by former Bahamian slaves after slavery was abolished in the British empire. The island remained under-developed until a brief boom of economic activity during the American Civil War, when it was a center for blockade runners smuggling goods (mostly weaponry, sugar and cotton) to the Confederacy. A second brief smuggling boom occurred during the years of prohibition in the US.[4]\\r\\nBy the mid-20th century, Grand Bahama's population numbered around 500 and the island was one of the least developed of the Bahamas' islands. However it finally gained a stable source of income when in 1955 a Virginian financier named Wallace Groves began redevelopment with the Bahamian government to build the city of Freeport under the Hawksbill Creek Agreement and create the Grand Bahama Port Authority. Soon after, the ambitious Edward St. George, with the financial help of Sir Jack Hayward, took the company to new frontiers. Seeing the success of Cuba as a tourist destination for wealthy Americans, St. George was eager to develop Grand Bahama in a similar vein. The city grew rapidly, with St. George adding a harbour, an airport soon after the city was founded, and the tourist center of Port Lucaya in 1962. Grand Bahama became the second most populous island in the Bahamas (over 50,000 in 2004).[5]\\r\\nTourism is the mainstay of the island's economy. The resort area at Port Lucaya and visits by cruise ships provide the bulk of this activity. Grand Bahama's tourism sector is complemented by the BORCO oil bunkering facility owned by Buckeye,[6] the South Riding Point oil storage and transhipment terminal owned by Statoil,[7] and a transshipment/container port partly owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa and the Grand Bahama Port Authority. There are also quarrying operations on the island and a large shipyard.\\r\\nThere are two airports on the island: Grand Bahama International Airport in Freeport, and West End Airport in West End. Grand Bahama International Airport is the larger of the two, and West End Airport is open sporadically for private aircraft only.\\r\\nGrand Bahama is divided into three districts and seven town areas for administrative purposes. Each district is run by a Chief Councilor, and each town area or township is run by a Chairperson. As of 1996 Grand Bahama has three districts.[8]\\r\\nElections are held every 5 years in Grand Bahama.

The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes and is portrayed by actress Sarah Drew.[1] She was introduced in the episode \\"Invasion\\" as a former surgical resident at Mercy West Hospital who joins the staff at Seattle Grace Mercy West after the two hospitals merge to compensate for the absence of some of the central cast members, and was created to be disliked by her colleagues.[2] The character was originally set to appear in two episodes, Drew's contract was extended to the remainder of the sixth season, with her becoming a series regular in the seventh season.[2][3] The character's focal storyline involved her struggle with fitting into the new work environment, her religious beliefs and balancing her duties as the hospital's chief resident and her friendship with her colleagues and as of the end of season eight, her relationship with her best friend and now ex-husband Jackson Avery.\\r\\nAlthough initially focusing on neurosurgery during her residency,[4] Kepner finally settles on trauma surgery as a specialty.[5] After failing her boards, Kepner departs upon her contracts expiration, but returns as a surgical attending when Chief Hunt offers her job back. Characterizing the character, ABC noted her determination, thoroughness, and intelligence as her main traits, while her insecurity, over-eagerness and vulnerability were highlighted as her main weakness. The character received mixed reviews from critics.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApril Kepner was born in Columbus, Ohio on April 23, 1982.[8] Her mother Karen is a teacher and her father Joe is a farmer. She is the second of four daughters; her sisters are Libby, Kimmie, and Alice. Kepner is initially a surgical resident at Mercy West Hospital. She joins the staff at Seattle Grace Mercy West after the merger of the two hospitals, alongside Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner), and Charles Percy (Robert Baker). Kepner is first shown to possess a red diary, in which she writes all her feelings and thoughts which is stolen by Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh). Grey uses the personal information written in the notebook to unnerve and blackmail Kepner but later apologizes. After she made a mistake that led to a patient's death, she is fired. However, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) rehires her when he becomes the new Chief of Surgery. As she is not confident anymore, she spends her time doing errands for Shepherd and develops a crush on him, earning her the nickname \\"Shepherd's flunky\\". In the season six finale, she discovers the body of her best friend Reed Adamson, who has been shot. She later runs into the shooter, Gary Clark, who lets her go after she tells him about her life after remembering a technique she says she learned from Oprah. Following the shooting, Kepner and Avery move into Meredith Grey's (Ellen Pompeo) house.\\r\\nKepner reveals that she is a virgin because she is a Christian and made a promise to God to stay a virgin until she was married, she also states that she thinks men find her annoying after yelling at Alex, Meredith, Lexie and Jackson about secrets, she claims that the fact that she is a 28 year old virgin is not a drinks conversation. She shows potential as a trauma surgeon during a trauma drill. She develops feelings for Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) who almost makes her lose her virginity. When Avery, now her best friend finds out about this, he assaults Karev. Later, Kepner agrees to go on a date with Robert Stark, believing him to have a good side. Her fellow residents make fun of her which prompts her to break up with him. April also impresses Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) and she is ultimately granted the position of Chief Resident in the season seven finale. Kepner initially struggles with her new status as her fellow doctors do not listen to her and do not take her seriously.\\r\\nAs the end of the fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Kepner, prepare for their boards exams for the different fellowships they plan on joining. The night before taking the exam, April loses her virginity to Avery. This causes her to re-evaluate her faith during her Boards Exams, making the examiners feel uncomfortable. It is revealed that she is the only one out of the residents to have failed her Boards Exams. She receives phone calls from other hospital retracting their offers of fellowships and is laid off from Seattle Grace. Although Avery has true feelings for her, she pushes him away because she believes that he feels guilty for having sex with her. As a celebration of the conclusion of their residencies, the former chief of surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) organizes his annual dinner for them. The eighth season ends with Kepner, Avery, Karev and Webber waiting for Meredith and Yang, who are victims of an aviation accident.\\r\\nMonths later, Hunt goes to visit April, who had moved back to her parents' farm in Moline, Ohio. In the wake of the tragic aviation accident, he offers her an attending position at the hospital. When she gets back to Seattle Grace, she resumes her sexual relationship with Avery, despite claiming she wants to re-virginise. April has a pregnancy scare and Jackson promises that he will be there every step of the way, even marry her, if she tests positive. When April finds out that she is not pregnant, she is overjoyed, but inadvertently hurts Jackson's feelings by saying that they dodged a bullet, seemingly thrilled that they don't have to get married anymore. Jackson breaks up with April.\\r\\nApril suggests to Jackson that they each take a date to Bailey's wedding in an attempt to move on. Jackson takes intern Stephanie; the two bond and eventually have sex. When Jackson tells April that he is sleeping with somebody else, she is visibly crushed and tells him that they can't be friends again until she has gotten over him. In the next episode, a very attractive paramedic named Matthew (Justin Bruening) asks April out for coffee and they start seeing each other. Shortly afterwards she turns to Jackson for dating advice and it is hinted that Jackson is still in love with her when he shows signs of jealousy but Jackson overcomes his jealousy and they then re-establish their friendship. She confesses to Matthew that she is not a virgin anymore as she led him to believe and he breaks up with her because she lied to him. However, in the next episode, Matthew forgives April and they get back together. He asks her to marry him through a flash mob and she says yes. In the season 9 finale, April thinks she lost Jackson when a bus blew up and tells him she loves him, but he only has a few injuries. She remains engaged to Matthew while Jackson dates Stephanie. At the wedding, Jackson realizes he still loves April and stands up professing his love. Jackson and April are seen driving off together at the start of the following episode and later it is revealed that they have secretly eloped.\\r\\nAt first April and Jackson do not tell their friends about their marriage, but later they do because of a new rule at the hospital. Catherine Avery is not at all happy about her son's elopement with April, and the fact that there wasn't a prenuptial agreement. They soon make up after April signs a postnuptial agreement. Jackson and April soon hit a rough patch when they realize that they have different views in the way their children should be raised religious. Not long after their fight, April realizes she is pregnant. April and Jackson's baby is diagnosed during pregnancy with Osteogenesis Imperfecta type 2, and learn that the baby will not survive long after birth. Jackson believes that termination is the best option, however April would rather give birth to the baby knowing it will not live very long. They scheduled an induction for the next day, at the beginning of the appointment they are asked to sign their baby's death certificate, which is too hard for the couple to bear. April doesn't sign the papers and returns to work the same day praying for a miracle, while at work she has a heart to heart with a lady who lost her fianc the night before. They decide to give birth to the baby via induction at 24 weeks gestation having it baptized right then. She gave birth to Samuel Norbert Avery, and he died a few hours after birth. In the following weeks after Samuel's death, April and Jackson find it hard to be around each other and be intimate with one another. After April tries to seduce Jackson in a supply closet, Jackson asks if she is sure she wants this so soon after the death of their son, leaving April to storm out in anger. In the series 11 finale April decides to join Owen Hunt for 3 months as a trauma surgeon in the army; this not being well received by Jackson. But after April states she needs this in order to grieve Samuel - Jackson lets her leave. Over the following months April lengthens her stay in the army, this having a strain on her and Jackson's marriage as Jackson can rarely get a hold of her or talk to her over the phone. On Christmas Day after already being away for some time, April announces to Jackson while on video chat that she is staying for a longer service period, Jackson becomes angry with April but the conversation is cut short by sounds of gunfire and explosions from April's base camp, leaving her to terminate the call; meanwhile Jackson is unsure whether his wife is hurt or if she is ever coming home.

Complications arise when April's water breaks and when rushed to the hospital, she appears to be in critical condition; however she survives the delivery (via c-section) and she and Jackson are shown their new daughter.\\r\\nDrew was cast in late September 2009 and first appeared on the show in the fifth episode of the sixth season as one of the residents from the Mercy West Hospital after its merger with Seattle Grace.[2] Drew was brought aboard Grey's Anatomy after former collaborations with the Series' producer and creator Shonda Rhimes;[3] she was formally featured as a guest in two episodes of Private Practice in 2008 and was one of the main cast in Rhimes television pilot Inside the Box (2009) which was eventually not picked up by ABC.[3] Her casting came after the absence of some of the central cast members, notably Katherine Heigl departure after her maternity leave and Ellen Pompeo's absence due to pregnancy.[2][3]\\r\\nDrew was originally contracted to guest star in a multi-episodes story arc where her character would be eventually fired from the series after two episodes.[3] She explained: \\"I came on to the show and I was told from day one that I was only going to be there for two episodes. I did not expect anything beyond that. The morning my firing episode aired, my agent got a call that they were talking about a contract and I was just completely floored.\\"[3] However she was promoted to a series regular on June 9, 2010 for the seventh season of the show.[9] Rhimes said in the wake of the news: \\"Kepner has really been folded into the group\\" of Grey's Anatomy adding \\"It'll depend on what the studio and the network decide to do with those actors, but I fully advocate to have [the characters]\\".[10] Drew received the call for her promotion the morning after the sixth episode of season six was telecast on October 29, 2009. She described the call as a \\"totally happy surprise\\".[11]\\r\\nDrew's character has been called intelligent, hardworking, thorough and determined by Grey's Anatomy executives.[13] But she is also considered vulnerable, insecure, sensitive and overly eager by her colleagues.[13] Of the character, Drew said: \\"April is a very, very good doctor. She really knows what she's doing, she's worked really hard, and she certainly wants to do her best and stick around.\\"[2] but also described her as \\"annoying\\", \\"neurotic\\" and \\"really insecure\\".[14] In the eighth season, April's position as chief resident and her struggle to get a handle on her fellow residents formed the central arc of her storyline. Rhimes explained: \\"Watching April try to be in charge of Cristina and Alex and Jackson is a pretty impossible task, and its made for comedy, its one of the funniest things were working on this season.\\"[15] One of Kepner's central characteristics is her religious belief, notably her chastity and her instance on saving herself for someone she truly loves.[16] In an interview, Drew assessed that: There certainly has never been a 28-year-old virgin on Greys. I dont even think theres been a 28-year-old virgin on television. Unless its someone who is sort of a recluse. A normal, smart, doctor.pretty, healthythat in and of itself is really fascinating, and really interesting, and totally different. Its neat to see someone who is just totally clueless in that area. Everyone else [On Grey' Anatomy] seems like they know exactly what theyre doing. April is totally, totally clueless. Shonda told one of the directors, there are virgins that have sort of done everything else. But not April. Aprils really pretty much done nothing. Shes completely untouched.\\"[17]\\r\\nKepner entertained several relationships throughout her time on Grey's Anatomy. In her early appearances, she is introduced as the best friend and roommate of her fellow Mercy West resident, Reed Adamson. In the season six finale, when Reed is tragically murdered by Gary Clark during the shooting, April is the first to find her when she trips over her dead body. In season seven April forms a friendship with Meredith Grey and she eventually moves into her house. Ellen Pompeo offered regarding their bond: \\"Meredith will accept April in order to get the audience to accept her,\\"[18] and Drew further explained: \\"Shes being plugged into the community. Meredith has really taken her under her wing, is really looking out for her. Having Meredith come around to April helps the audience come around to April.\\"[17]\\r\\nShe first develops a crush on Derek Shepherd in season six. Carina MacKenzie from The Los Angeles Times called it \\"ridiculous\\" and added: \\"April is drooling all over Chief McDreamy. Vomit. (...) She's been reduced to a 12-year-old with hearts in her eyes and a painful inability to be subtle.\\"[7] Drew herself was skeptical about it, saying: \\"The biggest thing that people did not like about my character was they thought I was a threat for the Mer/Der relationship, which I kind of found was super ridiculous (...) I never saw it as anything that would ever transpire into something that might threaten them. I only saw it as a really pathetic little crush.\\"[17] She briefly has feelings for Alex Karev who almost makes her lose her virginity when he tries to sleep with her in Something's Gotta Give. Wetpaint commented that he made her feel \\"worthless and unwanted when she was at her most vulnerable.\\"[19] Kepner also briefly dates Dr. Robert Stark, a senior pediatric surgical attending. After her fellow residents make fun of her, she breaks up with him, creating a coldness between them. However, it is Stark who recommends her as chief resident to Dr. Hunt. Drew stated: She sees a side to Dr. Stark that he doesnt show to anyone else at the hospital, and she finds that part endearing...I think they enjoy the companionship.[20]\\r\\nIn the end of season eight, Kepner embarks on a relationship with her best friend turned lover Jackson Avery (Williams), who she loses her virginity to and that eventually leads her to reflect on her faith and fail her boards.[21] Critics praised the chemistry between April and Jackon.[22] Rhimes commented on the dynamic between the two in season nine and said: I think its going to be funny, sexy, and good.[23]\\r\\nThe character received mixed reviews from critics and fans alike. Initially, Carina MacKenzie of the Los Angeles Times highly praised the characterization of Kepner. writing: \\"One of my favorite Mercy Westers is intern April (Sarah Drew). Her saccharine-sweet attitude and wide-eyed insincerity were hilarious, as was her super-mysterious hot pink notebook full of morale-boosting platitudes.\\"[7] However, she criticized the later development of her story, especially her crush on Derek Shepherd calling it \\"vomit\\"[24] PopSugar noted similarities between Kepner and Lexie Grey, stating: \\"Am I the only one who thinks the new doctor is kind of like Lexie 2.0? Their dynamic reminded me of when Lexie first started and tries really hard to make nice with Mere, but gets the cold shoulder in return.\\"[25] Mariella Mosthof from Wetpaint stated: \\"Despite her obnoxious yet well-meaning tendencies, we briefly flirted with the idea of liking April's character last season, and it looks like there's plenty of opportunity for her to come back and charm us again yet again this time around.\\" Reviewing the first part of the eight season, Courtney Morrison of TV Fanatic wrote: \\"Although the girl has grown in terms of likeability, her downfalls still outweigh the positives. She doesn't really bring too much to the table. She wasn't the best choice for Chief Resident; she doesn't seem to be on the same level surgical wise and she hasn't carried a story on her own that makes us care about her.\\"[26]\\r\\nKepner was included in TV Guide's list of The Most Loathed TV Characters, adding: \\"The extremely neurotic April (she makes Liz Lemon look laid back) has slowly made strides with fans thanks to her personal setbacks  she lost her treasured virginity to her best friend and failed her boards  but she still has a long way to go.\\"[6] Entertainment Weekly also named her one of the \\"21 Most Annoying TV Characters Ever\\", commenting: \\"April's lightened up a little this season [season 9], but a few episodes of sympathetic behavior can't erase the painful memories of Seattle Grace-Mercy West's most irritating doctor being.\\"[27] TV Fanatic included her in their list of Worst Character on TV. Christina Tran commented: \\"Could she be any more annoying?!?\\"[28] Drew stated that it was initially \\"hard\\" for her as an actress to play an unpopular character but deemed her \\"interesting\\" and when she was informed by the writers that her character would get Dr. Shepherd (Dempsey) shot in the season six finale, her reaction was: \\"Oh, come on, guys, really? They already hate my character, now they're going to hate her even more!\\"[14]\\r\\nCritics reception gradually changed positively. Entertainment Weekly noted: \\"April was chirpy, irritating, and immature, and her crush on Derek didn't endear her to us either. But these days, we say hooray for April; since Meredith declared that the two of them are pals, April's become a lot more tolerable, instead of being Lexie 2.0.\\"[29] Courtney Morrison of TVFanatic wrote: \\"April has grown since her character was introduced. Shes no longer much less annoying than she used to be, and shes honest. A girl with principles is a girl you want to do well.\\" and described her and Avery as \\"a couple for whom viewers can root\\".[30] The Hollywood Reporter also remarked: \\"It's nice to see April with a bit of a backbone and putting Alex in his place as the newfound confidence suits her well.\\"[31]\\r\\nSpecific\\r\\nGeneral","input":"When did april kepner join grey's anatomy?"},{"output":"an act of both penance and charity","context":"Works of Mercy (sometimes known as acts of mercy) are practices which Christians perform.\\r\\nThe practice is popular in the Catholic Church as an act of both penance and charity. In addition, the Methodist church teaches that the works of mercy are a means of grace which lead to holiness[1] and aid in sanctification.[2]\\r\\nThe works of mercy have been traditionally divided into two categories, each with seven elements:[3]\\r\\nPope John Paul II issued a papal encyclical \\"Dives in misericordia\\" on 30 November 1980 declaring that \\"Jesus Christ taught that man not only receives and experiences the mercy of God, but that he is also called 'to practice mercy' towards others.\\"[4] Another notable devotion associated with the works of mercy is the Divine Mercy, which are reputed to be apparitions of Jesus Christ to Saint Faustina Kowalska.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on Jesus' doctrine of the sheep and the goats, the corporal and spiritual works of mercy are a means of grace as good deeds[5] and their omission is a reason for damnation.[6] Because the Messianic Age will be a time of mercy,[7] and because the church believes this age began at Jesus' coming[8] and believes Jesus obeyed every mitzvah and fulfilled the Scriptures,[9] Catholics perform the works of mercy.[10]\\r\\nIn particular cases, a given individual will not be obligated or even competent to perform four of the spiritual works of mercy, namely: instructing the ignorant, counseling the doubtful, admonishing sinners, and comforting the afflicted. These works may require a definitely superior level of authority or knowledge or an extraordinary amount of tact. The other works of mercy, however, are considered to be an obligation of all faithful to practise unconditionally.[11] In an address on the 2016 World Day of Prayer for Creation, Pope Francis suggested \\"care for creation\\" as a new work of mercy. Corporally, it means simple daily gestures of peace and love; spiritually, it means contemplation of the world.[12]\\r\\nCorporal works of mercy are those that tend to the bodily needs of other creatures. They come from Isaiah 58[13] and the mitzvah of hospitality.[14] The seventh work of mercy comes from the Book of Tobit[15] and from the mitzvah of burial,[16] although it was not added to the list until the Middle Ages.[17]\\r\\nThe works include:[18]\\r\\nJust as the corporal works of mercy are directed towards relieving corporeal suffering, the aim of the spiritual works of mercy is to relieve spiritual suffering. The first four come from Ezekiel 33,[20] the fifth comes from the mitzvah of forgiving others before receiving forgiveness from God,[21] the sixth comes from Deuteronomy 15,[22] and the seventh comes from Maccabees 2.[23]\\r\\nThe works include:[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Corporal works of mercy are an important subject of Christian iconography. In some representations of the Middle Ages, the seven works were allegorically juxtaposed with the seven deadly sins (avarice, anger, envy, laziness, unchastity, intemperance, pride). The pictorial representation of the works of mercy began in the 12th century.\\r\\nThe Master of Alkmaar painted the polyptych of the Seven works of mercy (ca. 1504) for the Church of Saint Lawrence in Alkmaar, Netherlands. His series of wooden panel paintings show the works of mercy, with Jesus in the background viewing each, in this order: feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, bury the dead, shelter the traveler, comfort the sick, and ransom the captive.\\r\\nThe painting of the Seven Works of Mercy by Frans II Francken (1605) represents the acts not as a picture cycle, but in one single composition.\\r\\nA major work of the iconography of mercy is the altarpiece of Caravaggio (1606/07) in Naples, which was commissioned by the Confraternit del Pio Monte della Misericordia for their church. This charity brotherhood was founded in 1601 in Naples. The artist painted the Seven Works of Mercy in one single composition. Regarding the sharp contrasts of the paintings chiaroscuro, the art historian Ralf van Bhren explains the bright light as a metaphor for mercy, which \\"helps the audience to explore mercy in their own lives\\".[24]\\r\\nIn Methodist teaching, doing merciful acts is a prudential means of grace.[25] Along with works of piety, they are necessary for the believer to move on to Christian perfection.[26] In this sense, the Methodist concern for people at the margins is closely related to its worship.[27] As such, these beliefs have helped create the emphasis of the social gospel in the Methodist Church.[28]","input":"What are the catholic corporal works of mercy?"},{"output":"September 18, 1851","context":"","input":"When was the first new york times published?"},{"output":"Qinghai","context":"","input":"What is the source of the yangtze river?"},{"output":"Weird Sisters or Wayward Sisters","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Three Witches or Weird Sisters or Wayward Sisters are characters in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth (c. 1603ÿ1607). They hold a striking resemblance to the three \\"Fates\\" (in Greek mythology), and are, perhaps, intended as a twisted version of the white-robed incarnations of destiny. The witches eventually lead Macbeth to his demise. Their origin lies in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), a history of England, Scotland and Ireland. Other possible sources, aside from Shakespeare's imagination itself, include British folklore, such contemporary treatises on witchcraft as King James VI of Scotland's Daemonologie, the Norns of Norse mythology, and ancient classical myths of the Fates: the Greek Moirai and the Roman Parcae. Productions of Macbeth began incorporating portions of Thomas Middleton's contemporaneous play, The Witch,  circa 1618, two years after Shakespeare's death.\\r\\n\\r\\nShakespeare's witches are prophets who hail Macbeth, the general, early in the play, and predict his ascent to kingship. Upon killing the king and gaining the throne of Scotland, Macbeth hears them ambiguously predict his eventual downfall. The witches, and their \\"filthy\\" trappings and supernatural activities, all set an ominous tone for the play.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtists in the eighteenth century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) depicted the witches variously, as have many directors since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, or have adapted them to different cultures, as in Orson Welles's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"weird sisters\\" is found in most modern editions of Macbeth. However, the First Folio's text reads:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn later scenes in the first folio the witches are called \\"weyward\\", but never \\"weird\\". The modern appellation \\"weird sisters\\" derives from Holinshed's original Chronicles.[1] However, modern English spelling was only starting to become fixed by Shakespeare's time and also the word 'weird' (from Old English wyrd, fate) had connotations beyond the common modern meaning.  The Wiktionary etymology for \\"weird\\" includes this observation: \\"[The word] was extinct by the 16th century in English. It survived in Scots, whence Shakespeare borrowed it in naming the Weird Sisters, reintroducing it to English. The senses \\"abnormal\\", \\"strange\\" etc. arose via reinterpretation of \\"Weird Sisters\\" and date from after this reintroduction.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Shakespeare's principal sources for the Three Witches is found in the account of King Duncan in Raphael Holinshed's history of Britain, The Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1587). In Holinshed, the future King Macbeth of Scotland and his companion Banquo encounter \\"three women in strange and wild apparell, resembling creatures of elder world\\" who hail the men with glowing prophecies and then vanish \\"immediately out of their sight\\". Holinshed observes that \\"the common opinion was that these women were either the Weird Sisters, that is the goddesses of destiny, or else some nymphs or fairies endued with knowledge of prophecy by their necromantical science.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother principal source was the Daemonologie of King James published in 1597 which included a news pamphlet titled Newes from Scotland that detailed the infamous North Berwick witch trials of 1590. Not only had this trial taken place in Scotland, witches involved confessed to attempt the use of witchcraft to raise a tempest and sabotage the very boat King James and the Queen of Scots were on board during their return trip from Denmark. This is evidenced by the following passages:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\npurposely to be cassin into the sea to raise winds for destruction of ships. - Macbeth, I.iii.15ÿ25.\\r\\nThe news pamphlet states:\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover she confessed that at the time when his Majesty was in Denmark, she being accompanied with the parties before specially named, took a Cat and christened it, and afterward bound to each part of that Cat, the cheefest parts of a dead man, and several joints of his body, and that in the night following the said Cat was conveyed into the midst of the sea by all these witches sailing in their riddles or Cues as aforesaid, and so left the said Cat right before the Town of Leith in Scotland: this done, there did arise such a tempest in the Sea, as a greater has not been seen: which tempest was the cause of the perishing of a Boat or vessel coming over from the town of Brunt Island to the town of Leith, of which was many Jewels and rich gifts, which should have been presented to the current Queen of Scotland, at her Majestys coming to Leith. Again it is confessed, that the said christened Cat was the cause that the King Majestys Ship at his coming forth of Denmark, had a contrary wind to the rest of his Ships, then being in his company, which thing was most strange and true, as the Kings Majesty acknowledges  ÿ Daemonologie, Newes from Scotland\\r\\nThe concept of the Three Witches themselves may have been influenced by the Old Norse skaldic poem Darraearlj܇e (found in chapter 157 of Njls saga), in which twelve valkyries weave and choose who is to be slain at the Battle of Clontarf (fought outside Dublin in 1014).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nShakespeare's creation of the Three Witches may have also been influenced by an anti-witchcraft law passed by King James nine years previously, a law that was to stay untouched for over 130 years.[5] His characters' \\"chappy fingers,\\" \\"skinny lips,\\" and \\"beards,\\" for example, are not found in Holinshed.[6] Macbeth's Hillock near Brodie, between Forres and Nairn in Scotland, has long been identified as the mythical meeting place of Macbeth and the witches.[7][8] (Map) Traditionally, Forres is believed to have been the home of both Duncan and Macbeth.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Samuel Taylor Coleridge proposed that the three weird sisters should be seen as ambiguous figures, never actually being called witches by themselves or other characters in the play. Moreover, they were depicted as more fair than foul both in Holinshed's account and in that of contemporary playgoer Simon Forman.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Three Witches first appear in Act 1.1 where they agree to meet later with Macbeth. In 1.3, they greet Macbeth with a prophecy that he shall be king, and his companion, Banquo, with a prophecy that he shall generate a line of kings. The prophecies have great impact upon Macbeth. As the audience later learns, he has considered usurping the throne of Scotland. The Witches next appear in what is generally accepted to be a non-Shakespearean scene,[citation needed] 3.5, where they are reprimanded by Hecate for dealing with Macbeth without her participation. Hecate orders the trio to congregate at a forbidding place where Macbeth will seek their art. In 4.1, the Witches gather as Hecate ordered and produce a series of ominous visions for Macbeth that herald his downfall. The meeting ends with a \\"show\\" of Banquo and his royal descendants. The Witches then vanish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Three Witches represent evil, darkness, chaos, and conflict, while their role is as agents and witnesses. Their presence communicates treason and impending doom. During Shakespeare's day, witches were seen as worse than rebels, \\"the most notorious traitor and rebel that can be\\".[11] They were not only political traitors, but spiritual traitors as well. Much of the confusion that springs from them comes from their ability to straddle the play's borders between reality and the supernatural. They are so deeply entrenched in both worlds that it is unclear whether they control fate, or whether they are merely its agents. They defy logic, not being subject to the rules of the real world.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe witches' lines in the first act: \\"Fair is foul, and foul is fair / Hover through the fog and filthy air\\" are often said to set the tone for the remainder of the play by establishing a sense of moral confusion. Indeed, the play is filled with situations in which evil is depicted as good, while good is rendered evil. The line \\"Double, double toil and trouble,\\" (often sensationalised to a point that it loses meaning), communicates the witches' intent clearly: they seek only to increase trouble for the mortals around them.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the witches do not deliberately tell Macbeth to kill King Duncan, they use a subtle form of temptation when they inform Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing this thought in his mind, they effectively guide him on the path to his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation attributed to the Devil in the contemporary imagination: the Devil was believed to be a thought in a person's mind, which he or she might either indulge or reject. Macbeth indulges the temptation, while Banquo rejects it.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral non-Shakespearean moments are thought to have been added to Macbeth around 1618 and include all of 3.5 and 4.1.39ÿ43 and 4.1.125-32, as well as two songs.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a version of Macbeth by William Davenant (1606ÿ1668) a scene was added in which the witches tell Macduff and his wife of their future as well as several lines for the two before Macbeth's entrance in Act 4. Most of these lines were taken directly from Thomas Middleton's play The Witch. David Garrick kept these added scenes in his eighteenth-century version.[14] Horace Walpole created a parody of Macbeth in 1742 entitled The Dear Witches in response to political problems of his time. The witches in his play are played by three everyday women who manipulate political events in England through marriage and patronage, and manipulate elections to have Macbeth made Treasurer and Earl of Bath. In the final scene, the witches gather around a cauldron and chant \\"Double, double, Toil and Trouble / parties burn and Nonsense bubble.\\" Into their concoction they throw such things as \\"Judgment of a Beardless Youth\\" and \\"Liver of a Renegade\\". The entire play is a commentary on the political corruption and insanity surrounding the period.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrson Welles' stage production of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses. As with earlier versions, the women are bystanders to the murder of Banquo, as well as Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Their role in each of these scenes suggests they were behind Macbeth's fall in a more direct way than Shakespeare's original portrays. The witches encroach further and further into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Marowitz created A Macbeth in 1969, a streamlined version of the play which requires only eleven actors. The production strongly suggests that Lady Macbeth is in league with the witches. One scene shows her leading the three to a firelight incantation. In Eugne Ionesco's satirical version of the play Macbett (1972), one of the witches removes a costume to reveal that she is, in fact, Lady Duncan, and wants to be Macbeth's mistress. Once Macbeth is King and they are married, however, she abandons him, revealing that she was not Lady Duncan all along, but a witch. The real Lady Duncan appears and denounces Macbeth as a traitor.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish poet and playwright Le܇n Felipe wrote a version of Shakespeare's play in Spanish which significantly changes the witches' role, especially in the final scene. After Macbeth's death, the Three Witches reappear in the midst of wind and storm, which they have been associated with throughout the play, to claim his corpse. They carry it to a ravine and shout, \\"Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! / We have an appointment with you in Hell!\\" In the play, they also connect themselves to a painting by Francisco Goya called Volaverunt, in which three mysterious figures are flying through the air and supporting a more discernible royal female figure.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDrawings contained in Holinshed's Chronicles, one of the sources Shakespeare used when creating the characters, portray them as members of the upper class. They are wearing elaborate dresses and hairstyles and appear to be noblewomen as Macbeth and Banquo approach. Shakespeare seems to have diverted quite a bit from this image, making the witches (as Banquo says) \\"withered, and so wild in their attire, / That look not like th' inhabitants o' th' earth. . . each at once her choppy fingers laying / Upon her skinny lips. You should be women, / And yet your beards forbid me to interpret / That you are so.\\"[6][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Three Witches of Macbeth have inspired several painters over the years who have sought to capture the supernatural darkness surrounding Macbeth's encounters with them. For example, by the eighteenth century, belief in witches had waned in the United Kingdom. Such things were thought to be the simple stories of foreigners, farmers, and superstitious Catholics. However art depicting supernatural subjects was very popular. John Runciman, as one of the first artists to use Shakespearean characters in his work, created an ink-on-paper drawing entitled The Three Witches in 1767ÿ68. In it, three ancient figures are shown in close consultation, their heads together and their bodies unshown. Runciman's brother created another drawing of the witches called The Witches show Macbeth The Apparitions painted circa 1771ÿ1772, portraying Macbeth's reaction to the power of the witches' conjured vision. Both brothers' work influenced many later artists by removing the characters from the familiar theatrical setting and placing them in the world of the story.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry Fuseli would later create one of the more famous portrayals of the Three Witches in 1783, entitled The Weird Sisters or The Three Witches. In it, the witches are lined up and dramatically pointing at something all at once, their faces in profile. This painting was parodied by James Gillray in 1791 in Weird Sisters; Ministers of Darkness; Minions of the Moon. Three figures are lined up with their faces in profile in a way similar to Fuseli's painting. However, the three figures are recognisable as Lord Dundas (the home secretary at the time), William Pitt (prime minister), and Lord Thurlow (Lord Chancellor). The three of them are facing a moon, which contains the profiled faces of George III and Queen Charlotte. The drawing is intended to highlight the insanity of King George and the unusual alliance of the three politicians.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nFuseli created two other works depicting the Three Witches for a Dublin art gallery in 1794. The first, entitled Macbeth, Banquo and the Three Witches was a frustration for him. His earlier paintings of Shakespearean scenes had been done on horizontal canvases, giving the viewer a picture of the scene that was similar to what would have been seen on stage. Woodmason requested vertical paintings, shrinking the space Fuseli had to work with. In this particular painting he uses lightning and other dramatic effects to separated Macbeth and Banquo from the witches more clearly and communicate how unnatural their meeting is. Macbeth and Banquo are both visibly terrified, while the witches are confidently perched atop a mound. Silhouettes of the victorious army of Macbeth can be seen celebrating in the background, but lack of space necessitates the removal of the barren, open landscape seen in Fuseli's earlier paintings for the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery of the same scene.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nFuseli's other Macbeth Woodmason painting Macbeth and the Armed Head depicts a later scene in which Macbeth is shown MacDuff and warned to be wary of him. Fuseli evidently intended the two paintings to be juxtaposed. He said, \\"when Macbeth meets with the witches on the heath, it is terrible, because he did not expect the supernatural visitation; but when he goes to the cave to ascertain his fate, it is no longer a subject of terror.\\" Fuseli chose to make MacDuff a near-likeness of Macbeth himself, and considered the painting one of his most poetic in that sense, asking, \\"'What would be a greater object of terror to you if, some night on going home, you were to find yourself sitting at your own table . . . would not this make a powerful impression on your mind?\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least fifteen operas have been based on Macbeth,[22] but only one is regularly performed today. This is Macbeth, composed by Giuseppe Verdi to a libretto by Francesco Maria Piave and premired in Florence in 1847.  In the opera, the Three Witches became a chorus of at least eighteen singers, divided into three groups. Each group enters separately at the start of the opera for the scene with Macbeth and Banquo; after the men's departure, they have a chorus of triumph which does not derive from Shakespeare. They reappear in Act 3, when they conjure up the three apparitions and the procession of kings. When Verdi revised the opera for performance in Paris in 1865, he added a ballet (rarely performed nowadays) to this scene. In it, Hecate, a non-dancing character, mimes instructions to the witches before a final dance and Macbeth's arrival.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Henry Purcell's opera Dido and Aeneas with libretto by Nahum Tate, the Sorceress addresses the two Enchantresses as \\"Wayward Sisters,\\" identifying the three of them with the fates, as well as with the malevolent witches of Shakespeare's Macbeth.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrson Welles created a film version of the play in 1948, sometimes called the bermensch Macbeth, which altered the witches' roles by having them create a voodoo doll of Macbeth in the first scene. Critics take this as a sign that they control his actions completely throughout the film. Their voices are heard, but their faces are never seen, and they carry forked staves as dark parallels to the Celtic cross. Welles' voiceover in the prologue calls them \\"agents of chaos, priests of hell and magic\\". At the end of the film, when their work with Macbeth is finished, they cut off the head of his voodoo doll.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrone of Blood, a Japanese version filmed in 1958 by Akira Kurosawa, replaces the Three Witches with the Forest Spirit, an old hag who sits at her spinning wheel, symbolically entrapping Macbeth's equivalent, Washizu, in the web of his own ambition. She lives outside \\"The Castle of the Spider's Web\\", another reference to Macbeth's entanglement in her trap.[26] Behind her hut, Washizu finds piles of rotting bones. The hag, the spinning wheel, and the piles of bones are direct references to the Noh play Adachigahara (also called Kurozuka), one of many artistic elements Kurosawa borrowed from Noh theatre for the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoman Polanski's 1971 film version of Macbeth contained many parallels to his personal life in its graphic and violent depictions. His wife Sharon Tate had been murdered two years earlier by Charles Manson and three women. Many critics saw this as a clear parallel to Macbeth's murders at the urging of the Three Witches within the film.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nScotland, PA, a 2001 parody film directed by Billy Morrissette, sets the play in a restaurant in 1970s Pennsylvania. The witches are replaced by three hippies who give Joe McBeth drug-induced suggestions and prophecies throughout the film using a Magic 8-Ball. After McBeth has killed his boss, Norm Duncan, one of them suggests, \\"I've got it! Mac should kill McDuff's entire family!\\" Another hippie sarcastically responds, \\"Oh, that'll work! Maybe a thousand years ago. You can't go around killing everybody.\\"[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nVishal Bhardwaj's 2004 film Maqbool takes place in the setting of warring gangs in the Bombay underworld. The Three Witches are replaced by two corrupt policemen, who don't just pronounce prophecies but also actively shape events to \\"balance forces\\".[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeoffrey Wright's 2006 Macbeth takes place in the midst of a modern Australian gang and drug culture. The Three Witches are replaced by three teenage goth schoolgirls who are knocking down headstones in a graveyard in the opening scene. They whisper their prophecies in Macbeth's ear as they dance in a deserted nightclub.\\r\\n\\r\\nJustin Kurzel's hyperrealist 2015 Macbeth portrays the witches as poor women dabbling in witchcraft living off the countryside of Scotland with their children. While they appear amidst battles and make strangely accurate prophecies, they do not manifest anything supernatural otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nCome and Go, a short play written in 1965 by Samuel Beckett, recalls the Three Witches. The play features only three characters, all women, named Flo, Vi, and Ru. The opening line: When did we three last meet? [30] recalls the When shall we three meet again? of Macbeth: Act 1, Scene 1.[31] The Third Witch, a 2001 novel written by Rebecca Reisert, tells the story of the play through the eyes of a young girl named Gilly, one of the witches. Gilly seeks Macbeth's death out of revenge for killing her father.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nJ. K. Rowling has cited the Three Witches as an influence in her Harry Potter series. In an interview with The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet, when asked, \\"What if [ Voldemort ] never heard the prophecy?\\", she said, \\"It's the 'Macbeth' idea. I absolutely adore 'Macbeth.' It is possibly my favourite Shakespeare play. And that's the question isn't it? If Macbeth hadn't met the witches, would he have killed Duncan? Would any of it have happened? Is it fated or did he make it happen? I believe he made it happen.\\"[33] On her website, she referred to Macbeth again in discussing the prophecy: \\"the prophecy (like the one the witches make to Macbeth, if anyone has read the play of the same name) becomes the catalyst for a situation that would never have occurred if it had not been made.\\"[34] More playfully, Rowling also invented a musical band popular in the Wizarding world called The Weird Sisters that appears in passing in several books in the series as well as the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The third Harry Potter movie's soundtrack featured a song by John Williams called \\"Double Trouble\\", a reference to the witches' line, \\"Double double, toil and trouble\\". The lyrics of the song were adapted from the Three Witches' spell in the play.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerry Pratchett's 1988 Discworld novel Wyrd Sisters bears obvious reference to Shakespeare's three witches, as well as to a number of other plays by Shakespeare.","input":"What are the three witches in macbeth called?"},{"output":"October 7, 1996","context":"The Fox News Channel (FNC) is an American basic cable and satellite news television channel that was founded by media mogul Rupert Murdoch in 1996.

The frequency of dark-coloured moths increased at that time, an example of industrial melanism. Later, when pollution was reduced, the light-coloured form again predominated. Industrial melanism in the peppered moth was an early test of Charles Darwin's natural selection in action, and remains as a classic example in the teaching of evolution.[1][2] Sewall Wright described it as \\"the clearest case in which a conspicuous evolutionary process has actually been observed.\\"[3]\\r\\nThe dark-coloured or melanic form of the peppered moth (var. carbonaria) was not known before 1811. After field collection in 1848 from Manchester, an industrial city in England, the frequency of the variety was found to have increased drastically. By the end of the 19th century it almost completely outnumbered the original light-coloured type (var. typica), with a record of 98% in 1895.[4] The evolutionary importance of the moth was only speculated upon during Darwin's lifetime. It was 14 years after Darwin's death, in 1896, that J.W. Tutt presented it as a case of natural selection.[5] Due to this, the idea widely spread, and more people believed in Darwin's theory.\\r\\nBernard Kettlewell was the first to investigate the evolutionary mechanism behind peppered moth adaptation, between 1953 and 1956. He found that a light-coloured body was an effective camouflage in a clean environment, such as in Dorset, while the dark colour was beneficial in a polluted environment like in Birmingham. This selective survival was due to birds which easily caught dark moths on clean trees, and white moths on trees darkened with soot. The story, supported by Kettlewell's experiment, became the canonical example of Darwinian evolution and evidence for natural selection used in standard textbooks.[6]\\r\\nHowever, failure to replicate the experiment and criticism of Kettlewell's methods by Theodore David Sargent in the late 1960s led to general skepticism. When Judith Hooper's Of Moths and Men was published in 2002, Kettlewell's story was more sternly attacked, accused of fraud, and became widely disregarded. The criticism became a major argument for creationists. Michael Majerus was the principal defender. His seven-year experiment beginning in 2001, the most elaborate of its kind in population biology, the results of which were published posthumously in 2012, vindicated Kettlewell's work in great detail. This restored peppered moth evolution as \\"the most direct evidence\\", and \\"one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action\\".[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, the black peppered moth was rare. The first black specimen (of unknown origin) was kept in the University of Oxford in 1811.[8][9][10] The first live specimen was caught by R.S. Edleston in Manchester, England in 1848, but he reported this only 16 years later in 1864 in the journal Entomologist.[11] Edleston notes that by 1864 it was the more common type of moth in his garden in Manchester. The light-bodied moths were able to blend in with the light-coloured lichens and tree bark, and the less common black moth was more likely to be eaten by birds. As a result of the common light-coloured lichens and English trees, therefore, the light-coloured moths were much more effective at hiding from predators, and the frequency of the dark allele was about 0.01%.[12]\\r\\nDuring the early decades of the Industrial Revolution in England, the countryside between London and Manchester became blanketed with soot from the new coal-burning factories. Many of the light-bodied lichens died from sulphur dioxide emissions, and the trees became darkened. This led to an increase in bird predation for light-coloured moths, as they no longer blended in as well in their polluted ecosystem: indeed, their bodies now dramatically contrasted with the colour of the bark. Dark-coloured moths, on the other hand, were camouflaged very well by the blackened trees.[6] The population of dark-coloured moth rapidly increased. By the mid-19th century, the number of dark-coloured moths had risen noticeably, and by 1895, the percentage of dark-coloured moths in Manchester was reported at 98%, a dramatic change (of almost 100%) from the original frequency.[6] This effect of industrialization in body colour led to the coining of the term \\"industrial melanism\\".[2]\\r\\nThe implications of industrial melanism to Charles Darwin's natural selection was evident during his lifetime. Albert Brydges Farn (1841ÿ1921), a British entomologist, wrote to Darwin on 18 November 1878 to discuss his observation of colour variations in the Annulet moth (then Gnophos obscurata, now Charissa obscurata). He noted the existence of dark moths in peat in the New Forest, brown moths on clay and red soil in Herefordshire, and white moths on chalk cliffs in Lewes. He suggested this variation as an example of \\"survival of the fittest\\".[13] Surprisingly, scientific explanation came only in 1896, 14 years after Darwins death, when J.W. Tutt explicitly linked peppered moth melanism to natural selection. However, in a letter to Darwin, Farn explained his discovery of industrial melanism in Gnophos obscurata.[14] This letter shows that Darwin could have confirmed his theory of natural selection, had he realized the potential significance of the information that Farn provided.[12]\\r\\nMelanism has appeared in the European and North American peppered moth populations. Information about the rise in frequency is scarce. Much more is known about the subsequent fall in phenotype frequency, as it has been measured by lepidopterists using moth traps.\\r\\nSteward compiled data for the first recordings of the peppered moth by locality, and deduced that the carbonaria morph was the result of a single mutation that subsequently spread. By 1895, it had reached a reported frequency of 98% in Manchester.[15]\\r\\nFrom around 1962 to the present, the phenotype frequency of carbonaria has steadily fallen in line with cleaner air around industrial cities. Its decline has been measured more accurately than its rise, through more rigorous scientific studies. Notably, Bernard Kettlewell conducted a national survey in 1956, Bruce Grant conducted a similar one in early 1996,[16] and L.M. Cook in 2003.[17]\\r\\nSimilar results were found in America. Melanic forms have not been found in Japan. It is believed that this is because peppered moths in Japan do not inhabit industrialised regions.[citation needed]\\r\\nJ.W. Tutt was the first to propose the \\"differential bird predation hypothesis\\" in 1896, as a mechanism of natural selection. The melanic morphs were better camouflaged against the bark of trees without foliose lichen, whereas the typica morphs were better camouflaged against trees with lichens. As a result, birds would find and eat those morphs that were not camouflaged with increased frequency.[18]\\r\\nIn 1924, J.B.S. Haldane calculated, using a simple general selection model, the selective advantage necessary for the recorded natural evolution of peppered moths, based on the assumption that in 1848 the frequency of dark-coloured moths was 2%, and by 1895 it was 95%. The dark-coloured, or melanic, form would have had to be 50% more fit than the typical, light-coloured form. Even taking into consideration possible errors in the model, this reasonably excluded the stochastic process of genetic drift, because the changes were too fast.[19] Haldane's statistical analysis of selection for the melanic variant in peppered moths became a well known part of his effort to demonstrate that mathematical models that combined natural selection with Mendelian genetics could explain evolution  an effort that played a key role in the foundation of the discipline of population genetics, and the beginnings of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory with genetics.[20]\\r\\nIn peppered moths, the allele for dark-bodied moths is dominant, while the allele for light-bodied moths is recessive, meaning that the typica moths have a phenotype (visible or detectable characteristic) that is only seen in a homozygous genotype (an organism that has two copies of the same allele), and never in a heterozygous one. This helps explain how dramatically quickly the population changed when being selected for dark colouration.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe peppered moth Biston betularia is also a model of parallel evolution in the incidence of melanism in the British form (f. carbonaria) and the American form (f. swettaria) as they are indistinguishable in appearance. Genetic analysis indicates that both phenotypes are inherited as autosomal dominants. Cross hybridizations indicate the phenotypes are produced by isoalleles at a single locus.[21]\\r\\nSeveral alternative hypotheses to natural selection as the driving force of evolution were proposed during the 1920s and 1930s. Random mutation, migration or genetic drift were also seen as major forces of evolution.[22] However, the magnitude of the changes observed can only be accounted for by natural selection. It can be seen from population genetics that a non-differential change will not cause evolution. If the allele frequencies are denoted by the algebraic terms p and q, and (say) p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, then a non-differential reduction in population size from say 2000 to 100 individuals, will still produce the same values of (approximately) p = 0.6 and q = 0.4.\\r\\nP.A. Riley proposed an additional selective factor, where heavy metal chelation by melanin may protect peppered moths against the toxic effects of heavy metals associated with industrialisation. This selective advantage would supplement the major selective mechanism of differential bird predation.[23]\\r\\nJohn William Heslop-Harrison (1920) rejected Tutt's differential bird predation hypothesis, on the basis that he did not believe that birds ate moths. Instead he advocated the idea that pollutants could cause changes to the soma and germ plasm of the organism. This hypothesis probably has its roots in the 1890s, when it was proposed as a form of Lamarckism. It is important to note its historical context.[citation needed]\\r\\nHasebroek (1925) was the first to try to prove this hypothesis. He contended that air pollution altered lepidopteran physiology, thus producing an excess of black pigment. He exposed pupae of Lepidoptera to various doses of pollutant gases, namely hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3) and \\"pyredin\\" (presumably his spelling of pyridine). He used eight species in his studies, four of which were species of butterfly that did not exhibit melanism. Ford (1964) contends that Hasebroek's illustrations showed that the abnormal forms that appeared were not melanics, and Hasebroek failed to study their genetics.[citation needed]\\r\\nHeslop-Harrison (Harrison and Garrett 1926; Harrison 1928) suggested that the increase of melanic moths in industrialised regions was due to \\"mutation pressure\\", not to selection by predators which he regarded as negligible. Salts of lead and manganese were present in the airborne pollutant particles, and he suggested that these caused the mutation of genes for melanin production but of no others. He used Selenia bilunaria and Tephrosia bistortata as material. The larvae were fed with leaves that had incorporated these salts and melanics subsequently appeared. Similar experiments by Hughes McKenney (1932) and Thomasen and Lemche (1933) failed to replicate these results. However, the statistician and geneticist Ronald Fisher showed that Heslop-Harrison's controls were inadequate.[24] This hypothesis, however, appeared to be falsified by breeding experiments.\\r\\nThe first important experiments on the peppered moth were carried out by Bernard Kettlewell at Oxford University, under the supervision of E. B. Ford, who helped him gain a grant from the Nuffield Foundation to perform the experiments. In 1953, Kettlewell started a preliminary experiment in which moths were released into a large (18?m G 6?m) aviary, where they were fed on by great tits (Parus major). His main experiment, at Cadbury Nature Reserve in Birmingham, England, involved marking, releasing and recapturing marked moths. He found that in this polluted woodland typica moths were preferentially preyed upon. He thus showed that the melanic phenotype was important to the survival of peppered moths in such a habitat. Kettlewell repeated the experiment in 1955 in unpolluted woodlands in Dorset and again in the polluted woods in Birmingham. He was accompanied by Nico Tinbergen, and they made a film together.[2][18] In 1956 he repeated the experiments and found similar results; in Birmingham birds ate most of the white moths (75%), whereas in Dorset most of the dark moths (86%) were eaten.[1][25]\\r\\nTheodore David Sargent, professor of zoology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, published a critique of Kettlewell's work. Based on his experiments between 1965 and 1969, he concluded that it was not possible to reproduce Kettlewell's results, and said that birds showed no preference on moth on either black or white tree trunks.[26][27] He suggested that Kettlewell had trained the birds to pick moths on tree trunks to obtain desired results.[3][28]\\r\\nMichael Majerus's 1998 book Melanism: Evolution in Action is an adaptation of Kettlewell's The Evolution of Melanism, which discussed criticisms of Kettlewell's original experimental methods.[18] When the biologist Jerry Coyne reviewed this book in Nature, he stated that the most serious problem was that only two peppered moths had been found on tree trunks. He also wrote that the white moths had increased in numbers before the lichen had returned and that Kettlewell's findings of moths choosing matching backgrounds had not been replicated in later experiments. Coyne compared his reaction to \\"the dismay attending my discovery, at the age of 6, that it was my father and not Santa who brought the presents on Christmas Eve\\". He concluded that \\"for the time being we must discard Biston as a well-understood example of natural selection in action, although it is clearly a case of evolution. There are many studies more appropriate for use in the classroom\\" and that further studies of the animal's habits were needed.[29]\\r\\nContrary to this review, Majerus had stressed that the basic findings from that work were correct, and that differential bird predation of polluted environment \\"is the primary influence of the evolution of melanism in the peppered moth\\".[30][31] Coyne's statement that only two peppered moths had been found on tree trunks was incorrect, as the book gives the resting positions of 47 peppered moths Majerus had found in the wild between 1964 and 1996; twelve were on tree trunks (six exposed, six unexposed), twenty were at the trunk/branch joint, and fifteen resting on branches.[30] Majerus found that the review did not reflect the factual content of the book or his own views,[32] and cited an assessment by the entomologist Donald Frack that there was essentially no resemblance between the book and Coyne's review,[33] which appeared to be a summary of the Sargent et al. paper rather than Majerus's book.[34]\\r\\nThe review was subsequently picked up by the journalist Robert Matthews, who wrote an article for The Sunday Telegraph, 14 March 1999, claiming that \\"the rise and fall of the peppered moth, is based on a series of scientific blunders. Experiments using the moth in the Fifties and long believed to prove the truth of natural selection are now thought to be worthless, having been designed to come up with the 'right' answer.\\" Majerus regarded this view as surprising, and not one that would be shared by those involved in the field. He noted numerous scientific inaccuracies, misquotations and misrepresentations in the article, but thought this was common in press reports.[33] He stated that he had spoken to Matthews for over half an hour and had to explain many details as Matthews hadn't read the book, but \\"Even then, he got nearly everything wrong.\\"[32]\\r\\nThe 2002 book Of Moths and Men, by the journalist Judith Hooper,[35] said Kettlewell's experiments had appeared to be \\"the slam-dunk of natural selection\\", but argued that the cause of the dark forms appearing was still an \\"irreducible mystery\\".[36] Although not a creationist herself, Hooper argued that the peppered moth experiments failed to represent evolution. She claimed that Kettlewell's field notes could not be found and suggested that his experiment was fraudulent, on the basis of Sargent's criticisms alleging that the photographs of the moths were taken of dead moths placed on a log. She said that E. B. Ford was a \\"Darwinian zealot\\",[37] and claimed that he exploited the scientifically naive Kettlewell to obtain the desired experimental results. She then alleged that scientists in general showed \\"credulous and biased\\" acceptance of evolution.[38] The book's reception led to claims that the peppered moth evolution story ought to be deleted from textbooks.[39][40]\\r\\nScientists have examined the allegations made by Hooper, and found them to be without merit.[17][41][42] Majerus described the book as \\"littered with errors, misrepresentations, misinterpretations and falsehoods\\".[33] David W. Rudge, after critical analyses of Kettlewell' works, declared that \\"none of Hooper's arguments is found to withstand careful scrutiny\\",[43] and that all \\"these charges are baseless and stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of science as a process.\\"[44] He concluded \\"that Hooper does not provide one shred of evidence to support this serious allegation.\\"[43]\\r\\nWhen serious criticism and controversy arose, the story was picked up by creationists. Coyne's review was taken up by intelligent design creationists, and at a seminar presenting the wedge strategy on 13 March 1999, creationist and professor of law Phillip E. Johnson said that the moths \\"do not sit on tree trunks\\", \\"moths had to be glued to the trunks\\" for pictures and that the experiments were \\"fraudulent\\" and a \\"scam.\\"[45] This led Frack to exchange with intelligent design proponent Jonathan Wells, who conceded that Majerus listed six moths on exposed tree trunks (out of 47), but argued that this was \\"an insignificant proportion\\".[46] Wells wrote an essay on the subject, a shortened version of which appeared in The Scientist of 24 May 1999, claiming that \\"In 25 years of fieldwork, C.A. Clarke and his colleagues found only one peppered moth on a tree trunk\\", and concluding that \\"The fact that peppered moths do not normally rest on tree trunks invalidates Kettlewell's experiments\\".[47]\\r\\nIn 2000 Wells wrote Icons of Evolution, in which he claims, \\"What the textbooks don't explain, however, is that biologists have known since the 1980s that the classical story has some serious flaws. The most serious is that peppered moths in the wild don't even rest on tree trunks. The textbook photographs, it turns out, have been staged.\\"[48] The arguments were dismissed by Majerus, Cook and Bruce Grant who describes Wells as distorting the picture by selectively omitting or scrambling references in a way that is dishonest.[30] Professional photography to illustrate textbooks uses dead insects because of the considerable difficulty in getting good images of both forms of moth in the same shot. The scientific studies actually consisted of observational data rather than using such photographs. The photographs in Majerus's Melanism: Evolution in Action are unstaged pictures of live moths in the wild, and the photographs of moths on tree-trunks, apart from some slight blurring, look little different from the \\"staged\\" photographs.[30] While an experiment did involve the gluing of dead moths to trees, this practice was just one of many different ways used to study different individual elements of the overall hypothesis. This particular experiment was not meant to exactly reproduce natural conditions but instead was used to assess how the numbers of moths available (their density) affected the foraging practices of birds.[49]\\r\\nOn 27 November 2000, the school board of Pratt County, Kansas continued efforts to favor intelligent design teaching by requiring the use of alternative resources, such as Of Pandas and People designed by Wells and other ID scholars.[50] (In the book Wells accused Kettlewell's experiment as \\"fraudulent\\" and \\"staged\\".)[51] Coyne and Grant wrote a letter to The Pratt Tribune in which they defended the moth experiments and revealed the misrepresentations by Wells.[52]\\r\\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Majerus carried out experiments in Cambridge to resolve the various valid criticisms of Kettlewell's experiment. During his experiment, he noted the natural resting positions of peppered moths. Of the 135 moths examined over half were on tree branches, mostly on the lower half of the branch, 37% were on tree trunks, mostly on the north side, and only 12.6% were resting on or under twigs. Following correspondence with Hooper he added an experiment to find if bats, not birds, could be the main predators. He observed a number of species of bird actually preying on the moths, and that differential bird predation was a major factor responsible for the decline in carbonaria frequency compared to typica.[18] He described his results as a complete vindication of the natural selection theory of peppered moth evolution, and said \\"If the rise and fall of the peppered moth is one of the most visually impacting and easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action, it should be taught. It provides after all the proof of evolution.\\"[53]\\r\\nMajerus died before he could complete the writing up of his experiments, so the work was carried on by Cook, Grant, Saccheri and Mallet, and published on 8 February 2012 as \\"Selective bird predation on the peppered moth: the last experiment of Michael Majerus.\\"[54] The experiment became the largest ever in the study of industrial melanism, involving 4,864 individuals in a six-year investigation, and it confirmed that melanism in moths is a genuine example of natural selection involving camouflage and predation. Their concluding remark runs: \\"These data provide the most direct evidence yet to implicate camouflage and bird predation as the overriding explanation for the rise and fall of melanism in moths.\\"[7]\\r\\nCoyne responded by saying, \\"Despite the defensiveness of British evolutionists, I think my criticisms carried some weight, because Cambridge biologist Michael Majerus decided to repeat Kettlewell's experiments, but doing them correctly this time.\\" He quoted the Cook et al. conclusion that \\"These new data answer criticisms of earlier work and validate the methodology employed in many previous predation experiments that used tree trunks as resting sites. The new data, coupled with the weight of previously existing data convincingly show that 'industrial melanism in the peppered moth is still one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action'.\\" Coyne said he was \\"delighted to agree with this conclusion, which answers my previous criticisms about the Biston story.\\"[55]","input":"What caused natural selection among the peppered moths of manchester england?"},{"output":"three","context":"The Qaumi Taranah (Urdu: ???? ???????, Qaumؐ Tarnah pronounced?[?q??.mi ?t??.r?.n], lit.

It was officially adopted as Pakistan's national anthem in August 1954[1] and was recorded in the same year by eleven major singers of Pakistan including Ahmad Rushdi, Kaukab Jahan, Rasheeda Begum, Najam Ara, Naseema Shaheen, Zawar Hussain, Akhtar Abbas, Ghulam Dastagir, Anwar Zaheer and Akhtar Wasi Ali.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1948, A.

In December 1948, the Government of Pakistan established the National Anthem Committee (NAC) with the task of coming up with the composition and lyrics for the official national anthem of Pakistan. The NAC was initially chaired by the Information Secretary, Sheikh Muhammad Ikram, and its members included several politicians, poets and musicians, including Abdur Rab Nishtar, Ahmad G.

In 1950, the impending state visit of the Shah of Iran added urgency to the matter and resulted in the Government of Pakistan asking the NAC to submit an anthem without further delay. The NAC Chairman, then Federal Minister for Education, Fazlur Rahman, asked several poets and composers to write lyrics but none of the submitted works were deemed suitable. The NAC also examined several different tunes and eventually selected the one presented by Ahmed G. Chagla and submitted it for formal approval.[4] On 21 August 1949, the Government of Pakistan adopted Chaglas tune for the national anthem.[5]\\r\\nThe anthem, without lyrics, was performed for the first time for a foreign head of state on the state visit of the Shah of Iran to Pakistan in Karachi on 1 March 1950 by a Pakistan Navy band.\\r\\nIt was later played for Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan during his official visit to the United States on 3 May 1950. It was played before the NAC on 10 August 1950.[6] Official recognition to the national anthem, however, was not given until August 1954.[6] The NAC distributed records of the composed tune amongst prominent poets, who responded by writing and submitting several hundred songs for evaluation by the NAC. Eventually, the lyrics written by Hafeez Jullundhri were approved and the new national anthem was broadcast publicly for the first time on Radio Pakistan on 13 August 1954, sung by Hafeez Jullundhri himself. Official approval was announced by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on 16 August 1954. The composer, Ahmed G. Chagla, died in 1953, before the new national anthem was officially adopted.

Bhabha founded the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.[4] Physicist Raja Ramanna played an essential role in nuclear weapons technology research; he expanded and supervised scientific research on nuclear weapons and was the first directing officer of the small team of scientists that supervised and carried out the test.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Indian independence from the British Empire, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru authorised the development of a nuclear programme headed by Homi Bhabha. The Atomic Energy Act of 1948 focused on peaceful development.[4] India was heavily involved in the development of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but ultimately opted not to sign it.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must develop this atomic energy quite apart from war ÿ indeed I think we must develop it for the purpose of using it for peaceful purposes.  ... Of course, if we are compelled as a nation to use it for other purposes, possibly no pious sentiments of any of us will stop the nation from using it that way.\\r\\nIn 1954, Bhabha steered the nuclear programme in the direction of weapons design and production. Two important infrastructure projects were commissioned. The first established Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment at Mumbai (Bombay). The other created a governmental secretariat, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), of which Bhabha was the first secretary. From 1954 to 1959, the nuclear programme grew swiftly. By 1958, the DAE had one-third of the defence budget for research purposes.[4] In 1954, India reached a verbal understanding with Canada and the United States under the Atoms for Peace programme; Canada and the United States ultimately agreed to provide and establish the CIRUS research reactor also at Trombay. The acquisition of CIRUS was a watershed event in nuclear proliferation with the understanding between India and the United States that the reactor would be used for peaceful purposes only.[4] CIRUS was an ideal facility to develop a plutonium device, and therefore Nehru refused to accept nuclear fuel from Canada and started the programme to develop an indigenous nuclear fuel cycle.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1958, Nehru authorised \\"Project Phoenix\\" to build a reprocessing plant with a capacity of 20 tons of fuel a year ÿ a size to match the production capacity of CIRUS.[clarification needed][4] The plant used the PUREX process and was designed by the American firm Vitro International.[4] Construction of the plutonium plant began at Trombay on 27 March 1961, and it was commissioned in mid-1964.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear programme continued to mature, and by 1960, Nehru made the critical decision to move the programme into production.[4] At about the same time, Nehru held discussions with the American firm Westinghouse Electric to construct India's first nuclear power plant in Tarapur, Maharashtra.[4] Kenneth Nichols, a US Army engineer, recalls from a meeting[6] with Nehru, \\"it was that time when Nehru turned to Bhabha and asked Bhabha for the timeline of the development of a nuclear weapon\\". Bhabha estimated he would need about a year to accomplish the task.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1962, the nuclear programme was still developing, but at a slow rate.  Nehru was distracted by the Sino-Indian War, during which India lost territory to China.[4] Nehru turned to the Soviet Union for help, but the Soviet Union was preoccupied with the Cuban Missile Crisis.[4] The Soviet Politburo turned down Nehru's request for arms and continued backing the Chinese.[4] India concluded that the Soviet Union was an unreliable ally, and this conclusion strengthened India's determination to create a nuclear deterrent.[4] Design work began in 1965 under Bhabha and proceeded under Raja Ramanna who took over the programme after the former's death.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBhabha was now aggressively lobbying for nuclear weapons and made several speeches on Indian radio.[7]  In 1964, Bhabha told the Indian public via Indian radio that \\"such nuclear weapons are remarkably cheap\\" and supported his arguments by referring to the economical cost of American nuclear testing programme (Plowshare).[7] Bhabha stated to the politicians that a 10 kt device would cost around $350,000, and $600,000 for a 2 mt.[7] From this, he estimated that \\"a stockpile\\" of around 50 atomic bombs would cost under $21 million and a stockpile of 50 two-megaton hydrogen bombs would cost around $31.5 million.\\"[7] Bhabha did not realise, however, that the U.S. Plowshare cost-figures were produced by a vast industrial complex costing tens of billions of dollars, which had already manufactured nuclear weapons numbering in the tens of thousands.[7] The delivery systems for nuclear weapons typically cost several times as much as the weapons themselves.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear programme was partially slowed down when Lal Bahadur Shastri became the prime minister.[8] In 1965, Shastri faced another war with Pakistan.

Iyengar visited the Soviet Union with three colleagues and toured the nuclear research facilities at Dubna, Russia.[9] During his visit, Iyengar was impressed by the plutonium-fueled pulsed fast reactor.[9] Upon his return to India, Iyengar set about developing plutonium reactors approved by the Indian political leadership in January 1969.[9] The secret plutonium plant was known as Purnima,[10] and construction began in March 1969. The plant's leadership included Iyengar, Ramanna, Homi Sethna, and Sarabhai. Sarabhai's presence indicates that, with or without formal approval, the work on nuclear weapons at Trombay had been commenced.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia continued to harbour ambivalent feelings about nuclear weapons, and accorded low priority to their production until the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. In December 1971, Richard Nixon sent a carrier battle group led by the USS?Enterprise?(CVN-65) into the Bay of Bengal in an attempt to intimidate India. The Soviet Union responded by sending a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok to trail the US task force. The Soviet response demonstrated the deterrent value and significance of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile submarines to Indira Gandhi.[11] India gained the military and political initiative over Pakistan after acceding to the treaty that divided Pakistan into two different political entities.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 September 1972, near the peak of her post-war popularity, Indira Gandhi authorised the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) to manufacture a nuclear device and prepare it for a test.[5]  Although the Indian Army was not fully involved in the nuclear testing, the army's highest command was kept fully informed of the test preparations.[9] The preparations were carried out under the watchful eyes of the Indian political leadership, with civilian scientists assisting the Indian Army.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe device was formally called the \\"Peaceful Nuclear Explosive\\", but it was usually referred to as the Smiling Buddha.[2] The device was detonated on 18 May 1974, Buddha Jayanti (a festival day in India marking the birth of Gautama Buddha).[12]  Indira Gandhi maintained tight control of all aspects of the preparations of the Smiling Buddha test, which was conducted in extreme secrecy; besides Gandhi, only advisers Parmeshwar Haksar and Durga Dhar were kept informed.[2] Scholar Raj Chengappa asserts the Indian Defence Minister Jagjivan Ram was not provided with any knowledge of this test and came to learn of it only after it was conducted.[13] Swaran Singh, the Minister of External Affairs, was given 48 hours advance notice.[14] The Indira Gandhi administration employed no more than 75 civilian scientists while General G. G. Bewoor, Indian army chief, and the commander of Indian Western Command were the only military commanders kept informed.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head of this entire nuclear bomb project was the director of the BARC, Raja Ramanna. In later years, his role in the nuclear programme would be more deeply integrated as he remained head of the nuclear programme most of his life. The designer and creator of the bomb was P. K. Iyengar, who was the second in command of this project. Iyengar's work was further assisted by the chief metallurgist, R. Chidambaram, and by Nagapattinam Sambasiva Venkatesan of the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, who developed and manufactured the high explosive implosion system. The explosive materials and the detonation system were developed by Waman Dattatreya Patwardhan of the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overall project was supervised by chemical engineer Homi Sethna, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India. Chidambaram, who would later coordinate work on the Pokhran-II tests, began work on the equation of state of plutonium in late 1967 or early 1968. To preserve secrecy, the project employed no more than 75 scientists and engineers from 1967ÿ74.[5][15] Abdul Kalam also arrived at the test site as the representative of the DRDO.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe device was of the implosion-type design and had a close resemblance to the American nuclear bomb called the Fat Man.[2] The implosion system was assembled at the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL) of the DRDO in Chandigarh.[2] The detonation system was developed at the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL) of the DRDO in Pune, Maharashtra State.[2]  The 6?kg of plutonium came from the CIRUS reactor at BARC.[2] The neutron initiator was of the poloniumÿberyllium type and code-named Flower. The complete nuclear bomb was engineered and finally assembled by Indian engineers at Trombay before transportation to the test site.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fully assembled device had a hexagonal cross section, 1.25 metres in diameter, and weighed 1400?kg.[2] The device was mounted on a hexagonal metal tripod, and was transported to the shaft on rails which the army kept covered with sand.[2] The device was detonated when Dastidar pushed the firing button at 8.05 a.m.; it was in a shaft 107 m under the army Pokhran test range in the Thar Desert (or Great Indian Desert), Rajasthan.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nuclear yield of this test still remains controversial, with unclear data provided by Indian sources, although Indian politicians have given the country's press a range from 2?kt to 20?kt.[2] The official yield was initially set at 12?kt; post-Operation Shakti claims have raised it to 13?kt.[2] Independent seismic data from outside and analysis of the crater features indicate a lower figure.[2] Analysts usually estimate the yield at 4 to 6?kt, using conventional seismic magnitude-to-yield conversion formulas. In recent years, both Homi Sethna and P. K. Iyengar have conceded the official yield to be an exaggeration.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIyengar has variously stated that the yield was 8ÿ10?kt, that the device was designed to yield 10?kt, and that the yield was 8?kt \\"exactly as predicted\\". Although seismic scaling laws lead to an estimated yield range between 3.2 kt and 21 kt,[16] an analysis of hard rock cratering effects suggests a narrow range of around 8?kt for the yield,[2] which is within the uncertainties of the seismic yield estimate.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had already gained much popularity and publicity after her successful military campaign against Pakistan in the 1971 war.[17]   The test caused an immediate revival of Indira Gandhi's popularity, which had flagged considerably from its high after the 1971 war. The overall popularity and image of the Congress Party was enhanced and the Congress Party was well received in the Indian Parliament.[17] In 1975, Homi Sethna, a chemical engineer and the chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission (AECI), Raja Ramanna of BARC, and  Basanti Nagchaudhuri of DRDO, all were honoured with the Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award.[17] Five other project members received the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award.[17] India consistently maintained that this was a peaceful nuclear bomb test and that it had no intentions of militarising its nuclear programme. However, according to independent monitors, this test was part of an accelerated Indian nuclear programme.[1]\\r\\nIn 1997 Raja Ramanna, speaking to the Press Trust of India, maintained:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pokhran test was a bomb, I can tell you now.... An explosion is an explosion, a gun is a gun, whether you shoot at someone or shoot at the ground.... I just want to make clear that the test was not all that peaceful.\\r\\nWhile India continued to state that the test was for peaceful purposes, it encountered opposition from many quarters.  The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) was formed in reaction to the Indian tests to check international nuclear proliferation.[18] The NSG decided in 1992 to require full-scope IAEA safeguards for any new nuclear export deals,[19] which effectively ruled out nuclear exports to India, but in 2008 it waived this restriction on nuclear trade with India as part of the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nPakistan did not view the test as a \\"peaceful nuclear explosion\\", and cancelled talks scheduled for 10 June on normalisation of relations.[5] Pakistan's Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto vowed in June 1974 that he would never succumb to \\"nuclear blackmail\\" or accept \\"Indian hegemony or domination over the subcontinent\\".[21] The chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Munir Ahmed Khan, said that the test would force Pakistan to test its own nuclear bomb.[22] Pakistan's leading nuclear physicist, Pervez Hoodbhoy, stated in 2011 that he believed the test \\"pushed [Pakistan] further into the nuclear arena\\".[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plutonium used in the test was created in the CIRUS reactor supplied by Canada and using heavy water supplied by the United States. Both countries reacted negatively, especially in light of then ongoing negotiations on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the economic aid both countries had provided to India.[5][24] Canada concluded that the test violated a 1971 understanding between the two states, and froze nuclear energy assistance for the two heavy water reactors then under construction.[5] The United States concluded that the test did not violate any agreement and proceeded with a June 1974 shipment of enriched uranium for the Tarapur reactor.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance sent a congratulatory telegram to India but later withdrew it.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite many proposals, India did not carry out further nuclear tests until 1998. After the 1998 general elections, Operation Shakti (also known as Pokhran-II) was carried out at the Pokhran test site, using devices designed and built over the preceding two decades.[5][26]","input":"When did india conduct her first nuclear test?"},{"output":"a group of conditions where a disturbance in the person's mood is the main underlying feature","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nMood disorder, also known as mood (affective) disorders, is a group of conditions where a disturbance in the person's mood is the main underlying feature.[1] The classification is  in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD).\\r\\n\\r\\nMood disorders fall into the basic groups of elevated mood, such as mania or hypomania; depressed mood, of which the best-known and most researched is major depressive disorder (MDD) (commonly called clinical depression, unipolar depression, or major depression); and moods which cycle between mania and depression, known as bipolar disorder (BD) (formerly known as manic depression). There are several sub-types of depressive disorders or psychiatric syndromes featuring less severe symptoms such as dysthymic disorder (similar to but milder than MDD) and cyclothymic disorder (similar to but milder than BD).[2][page?needed] Mood disorders may also be substance induced or occur in response to a medical condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish psychiatrist Henry Maudsley proposed an overarching category of affective disorder.[3] The term was then replaced by mood-disorder, as the latter term refers to the underlying or longitudinal emotional state,[4] whereas the former refers to the external expression observed by others.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nA minority of people with bipolar disorder have high creativity, artistry or a particular gifted talent. Before the mania phase becomes too extreme, its energy, ambition, enthusiasm and grandiosity often bring people with this type of mood disorder life's masterpieces.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nA mood disorder can be classified as substance-induced if its etiology can be traced to the direct physiologic effects of a psychoactive drug or other chemical substance, or if the development of the mood disorder occurred contemporaneously with substance intoxication or withdrawal. Also, an individual may have a mood disorder coexisting with a substance abuse disorder. Substance-induced mood disorders can have features of a manic, hypomanic, mixed, or depressive episode. Most substances can induce a variety of mood disorders. For example, stimulants such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine can cause manic, hypomanic, mixed, and depressive episodes.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh rates of major depressive disorder occur in heavy drinkers and those with alcoholism. Controversy has previously surrounded whether those who abused alcohol and developed depression were self-medicating their pre-existing depression. But recent research has concluded that, while this may be true in some cases, alcohol misuse directly causes the development of depression in a significant number of heavy drinkers. Participants studied were also assessed during stressful events in their lives and measured on a Feeling Bad Scale. Likewise, they were also assessed on their affiliation with  deviant  peers, unemployment, and their partners substance use and criminal offending.[33][34][35] High rates of suicide also occur in those who have alcohol-related problems.[36] It is usually possible to differentiate between alcohol-related depression and depression that is not related to alcohol intake by taking a careful history of the patient.[35][37][38] Depression and other mental health problems associated with alcohol misuse may be due to distortion of brain chemistry, as they tend to improve on their own after a period of abstinence.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nBenzodiazepines, such as alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam and diazepam, can cause both depression and mania.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nBenzodiazepines are a class of medication commonly used to treat anxiety, panic attacks and insomnia, and are also commonly misused and abused. Those with anxiety, panic and sleep problems commonly have negative emotions and thoughts, depression, suicidal ideations, and often have comorbid depressive disorders. While the anxiolytic and hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines disappear as tolerance develops, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist.[41] Unfortunately, these symptoms are often interpreted as an exacerbation or as a natural evolution of previous disorders and the chronic use of sedatives is overlooked.[41] Benzodiazepines do not prevent the development of depression, can exacerbate preexisting depression, can cause depression in those with no history of it, and can lead to suicide attempts.[41][42][43][44][45] Risk factors for attempted and completed suicide while using benzodiazepines include high dose prescriptions (even in those not misusing the medications), benzodiazepine intoxication, and underlying depression.[40][46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long-term use of benzodiazepines may have a similar effect on the brain as alcohol, and are also implicated in depression.[48] As with alcohol, the effects of benzodiazepine on neurochemistry, such as decreased levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, are believed to be responsible for the increased depression.[49][50][51][52][53][54] Additionally, benzodiazepines can indirectly worsen mood by worsening sleep (i.e., benzodiazepine-induced sleep disorder). Like alcohol, benzodiazepines can put people to sleep but, while asleep, they disrupt sleep architecture: decreasing sleep time, delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep sleep (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood).[55][56][57] Just as some antidepressants can cause or worsen anxiety in some patients due to being activating, benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression due to being a central nervous system depressantworsening thinking, concentration and problem solving (i.e., benzodiazepine-induced neurocognitive disorder).[40] However, unlike antidepressants, in which the activating effects usually improve with continued treatment, benzodiazepine-induced depression is unlikely to improve until after stopping the medication.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a long-term follow-up study of patients dependent on benzodiazepines, it was found that 10 people (20%) had taken drug overdoses while on chronic benzodiazepine medication despite only two people ever having had any pre-existing depressive disorder. A year after a gradual withdrawal program, no patients had taken any further overdoses.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as with intoxication and chronic use, benzodiazepine withdrawal can also cause depression.[59][60][61] While benzodiazepine-induced depressive disorder may be exacerbated immediately after discontinuation of benzodiazepines, evidence suggests that mood significantly improves after the acute withdrawal period to levels better than during use.[41] Depression resulting from withdrawal from benzodiazepines usually subsides after a few months but in some cases may persist for 6ÿ12 months.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Mood disorder due to a general medical condition\\" is used to describe manic or depressive episodes which occur secondary to a medical condition.[64] There are many medical conditions that can trigger mood episodes, including neurological disorders (e.g. dementias), metabolic disorders (e.g. electrolyte disturbances), gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. cirrhosis), endocrine disease (e.g. thyroid abnormalities), cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart attack), pulmonary disease (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cancer, and autoimmune diseases .[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nMood disorder not otherwise specified (MD-NOS) is a mood disorder that is impairing but does not fit in with any of the other officially specified diagnoses. In the DSM-IV MD-NOS is described as \\"any mood disorder that does not meet the criteria for a specific disorder.\\"[65] MD-NOS is not used as a clinical description but as a statistical concept for filing purposes.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost cases of MD-NOS represent hybrids between mood and anxiety disorders, such as mixed anxiety-depressive disorder or atypical depression.[66] An example of an instance of MD-NOS is being in minor depression frequently during various intervals, such as once every month or once in three days.[65] There is a risk for MD-NOS not to get noticed, and for that reason not to get treated.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeta-analyses show that high scores on the personality domain neuroticism is a strong predictor for the development of mood disorders.[68] A number of authors have also suggested that mood disorders are an evolutionary adaptation.[69] A low or depressed mood can increase an individual's ability to cope with situations in which the effort to pursue a major goal could result in danger, loss, or wasted effort.[70] In such situations, low motivation may give an advantage by inhibiting certain actions. This theory helps to explain why negative life incidents precede depression in around 80 percent of cases,[71][72] and why they so often strike people during their peak reproductive years. These characteristics would be difficult to understand if depression were a dysfunction.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nA depressed mood is a predictable response to certain types of life occurrences, such as loss of status, divorce, or death of a child or spouse. These are events that signal a loss of reproductive ability or potential, or that did so in humans' ancestral environment. A depressed mood can be seen as an adaptive response, in the sense that it causes an individual to turn away from the earlier (and reproductively unsuccessful) modes of behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nA depressed mood is common during illnesses, such as influenza. It has been argued that this is an evolved mechanism that assists the individual in recovering by limiting his/her physical activity.[73]  The occurrence of low-level depression during the winter months, or seasonal affective disorder, may have been adaptive in the past, by limiting physical activity at times when food was scarce.[73]  It is argued that humans have retained the instinct to experience low mood during the winter months, even if the availability of food is no longer determined by the weather.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of what we know about the genetic influence of clinical depression is based upon research that has been done with identical twins. Identical twins both have exactly the same genetic code. It has been found that when one identical twin becomes depressed the other will also develop clinical depression approximately 76% of the time. When identical twins are raised apart from each other, they will both become depressed about 67% of the time. Because both twins become depressed at such a high rate, the implication is that there is a strong genetic influence. If it happened that when one twin becomes clinically depressed the other always develops depression, then clinical depression would likely be entirely genetic.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nBipolar disorder is also considered a mood disorder. In the case of bipolar disorder several causes have been considered as possible, please see the Wikipedia page Bipolar disorder for more details on the most common attributed causes. Recently, apart of the recent knowledge, it is hypothesized and there is evidence [75] that bipolar disorder might be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction or mitochondrial disease.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DSM-5, released in May 2013, separates the mood disorder chapter from the DSM-TR-IV into two sections: Depressive and Related Disorders and Bipolar and Related Disorders. Bipolar Disorders falls in between Depressive Disorders and Schizophrenia Spectrum and Related Disorders in recognition of their place as a bridge between the two diagnostic classes in terms of symptomatology, family history and genetics (Ref. 1, p 123).[78] Bipolar Disorders underwent a few changes in the DSM-5, most notably the addition of more specific symptomology related to hypomanic and mixed manic states. Depressive Disorders underwent the most changes, the addition of three new disorders: disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, persistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (previously in Appendix B, the section for disorders needing further research). Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is meant as a diagnosis for children and adolescents who would normally be diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a way to limit the bipolar diagnosis in this age cohort. Major depressive disorder (MDD) also underwent a notable change, in that the bereavement clause has been removed. Those previously exempt from a diagnosis of MDD due to bereavement are now candidates for the MDD diagnosis.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are different types of treatments available for mood disorders, such as therapy and medications. Behaviour therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy and interpersonal therapy have all shown to be potentially beneficial in depression.[80][81] Major depressive disorder medications usually include antidepressants, while bipolar disorder medications can consist of antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants[82] and/or lithium. Lithium specifically has been proven to reduce suicide and all causes of mortality in people with mood disorders.[83] If mitochondrial dysfunction or mitochondrial diseases are the cause of mood disorders like bipolar disorder,[76] then it has been hypothesized that N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR), S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), creatine monohydrate (CM), and melatonin could be potential treatment options.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a substantial amount of epidemiology studies conducted, women are twice as likely to develop certain mood disorders, such as major depression.  Although there is an equal number of men and women diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, women have a slightly higher frequency of the disorder.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, mood disorders were the most common reason for hospitalization among children aged 1ÿ17 years in the United States, with approximately 112,000 stays.[86] Mood disorders were top principal diagnosis for Medicaid super-utilizers in the United States in 2012.[87] Further, a study of 18 States found that mood disorders accounted for the highest number of hospital readmissions among Medicaid patients and the uninsured, with 41,600 Medicaid patients and 12,200 uninsured patients being readmitted within 30 days of their index staya readmission rate of 19.8 per 100 admissions and 12.7 per 100 admissions, respectively.[88] In 2012, mood and other behavioral health disorders were the most common diagnoses for Medicaid-covered and uninsured hospital stays in the United States (6.1% of Medicaid stays and 5.2% of uninsured stays).[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study conducted in 1988 to 1994 amongst young American adults involved a selection of demographic and health characteristics. A population-based sample of 8,602 men and women ages 17ÿ39 years participated. Lifetime prevalence were estimated based on six mood measures: \\r\\n\\r\\nKay Redfield Jamison and others have explored the possible links between mood disorders  especially bipolar disorder  and creativity. It has been proposed that a \\"ruminating personality type may contribute to both [mood disorders] and art.\\"[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nJane Collingwood notes an Oregon State University study that\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Liz Patereks article \\"Bipolar Disorder and the Creative Mind\\"[93] she wrote\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between depression and creativity appears to be especially strong among poets.[94][95]","input":"What is the definition of a mood disorder?"},{"output":"import certain material and equipment on a duty-free and tariff-free basis for assembly, processing, or manufacturing and then export the assembled, processed and/or manufactured products, sometimes back to the raw materials' country of origin","context":"In Mexico, a maquiladora (Spanish pronunciation:?[makila?eo?a]) or maquila (IPA:?[ma?kila])[1] is a manufacturing operation, where factories import certain material and equipment on a duty-free and tariff-free basis for assembly, processing, or manufacturing and then export the assembled, processed and/or manufactured products, sometimes back to the raw materials' country of origin.[citation needed] They are an example of special economic zones as seen in many countries.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1964, the Bracero Program, which allowed Mexican agricultural workers to work legally in the U.S. on a seasonal basis, came to an end.[citation needed] Less than a year after the end of the Bracero Program, the Mexican Government launched the Border Industrialization Program (BIP) or the Maquiladora Program, to solve the problem of rising unemployment along the border.[citation needed][2] The maquiladoras became attractive to US firms due to the availability of cheap labor, devaluations of the peso and favorable changes in US customs laws.[citation needed] In 1985, maquiladoras overtook tourism as the largest source of foreign exchange, and since 1996 they have been the second largest industry in Mexico behind the petroleum industry.[3]\\r\\nFollowing the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the growth of maquila plants skyrocketed.[citation needed] During the five years before NAFTA, the maquila employment had grown at a rate of 47%; this figure increased to 86% in the next five years. The number of factories also increased dramatically. In the five years preceding NAFTA, 564 new plants opened; in the five years following, 1460 plants opened. However, the maquiladora growth is largely attributable to growth in US demand, and devaluation of the peso and not NAFTA itself.[4][5][6] In the 1970s, most maquiladoras were located around the MexicoÿUnited States border. By 1994, these were spread in the interior parts of the country, although the majority of the plants were still near the border. Recent research indicates that the maquiladora industry affects U.S. border city employment in service sectors.[7]\\r\\nAlthough the maquiladora industry suffered due to the early 2000s recession, maquiladoras constituted 54% of the US-Mexico trade in 2004, and by 2005, the maquiladora exports accounted for half of Mexico's exports.[6] The industry had become an important source of foreign direct investment and foreign exchange for Mexico.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the 2000s, the maquila industry faced competition due to rise of other countries with availability of cheap labor, including Malaysia, India, and Pakistan. The biggest threat came from China's Special Economic Areas.[6]\\r\\nDuring the later half of the sixties, maquiladora industries rapidly expanded geographically and economically and by 1985, had become Mexicos second largest source of income from exports, behind oil.[8] Since 1973, maquiladoras have also accounted for nearly half of Mexicos export assembly.[8] Between 1995 and 2000, exports of assembled products in Mexico tripled, and the rate of the industrys growth amounted to about one new factory per day.[9] By the late twentieth century, the industry accounted for 25 percent of Mexicos gross domestic product, and 17 percent of total Mexican employment.[10]\\r\\nSince globalization and physical restructuring[citation needed] have contributed to the competition and advent of low-cost offshore assembly in places such as China, and countries in Central America, maquiladoras in Mexico have been on the decline since 2000: According to federal sources, approximately 529 maquiladoras shut down and investment in assembly plants decreased by 8.2 percent in 2002 after the imposition of countervailing duties on Chinese products, not available in North America, that were part of the electronics supply chain.[9] Despite the decline, over 3,000 maquiladoras still exist along the 2,000 mile-long United StatesÿMexico border, providing employment for approximately one million workers, and importing more than $51 billion in supplies into Mexico.[11] Research indicates that maquiladoras' post-NAFTA growth is connected to changes in Mexican wages relative to those in Asia and in the United States, and to fluctuations in U.S. industrial production.[12] As of 2006, maquiladoras still accounted for 45 percent of Mexicos exports.[13] Maquiladoras, in general, are best represented among operations that are particularly assembly intensive.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne of the main goals of the Border Industrialization Program was to attract foreign investment. Mexican blue-collar labor is kept cheap and competitive with other major export countries by devaluations in the peso, often corresponding with the end of presidential terms. Mexicans work for approximately one-sixth of the U.S. hourly rate.[14]\\r\\nYoung women are often preferred over older women, as younger women are capable of working longer hours. Although Mexican labor law is much more stringent than American labor laws (e.g. the requirement that workers be paid three months severance after as much time on the job, should they be let go without cause), women are sometimes subjected to unsafe and unsanitary working conditions.[15] Poverty is a key factor that motivates women, in particular, to work in maquiladoras. The minimum wage set by the Mexican government is barely enough to help sustain a family. The minimum wage \\"buys only about a quarter of the basic necessities that are essential for a typical workers family\\".[16] Maquilas pay at much higher than the minimum wage in most markets since there is a lot of competition for the best workers, and workers will not work without transportation and other bonuses. The 2015 Minimum wage is 70.1 pesos per day in Tijuana (minimum wages vary by zone and worker classification) or about $0.55 per hour at the current exchange rate of 16 pesos per dollar,[17] while most entry level positions in maquilas pay closer to $2 per hour including bonuses and 25% Social Security and housing and retirement.[18]\\r\\nMexico possesses a strong system of labor laws, yet enforcement of these laws within the maquiladora industry is often lax.?[19]?(p1) While most people who were employed under the original Bracero Program were men, the majority of maquiladora employees are young women.[19](p3)\\r\\nBoth the United States and Mexican governments claim to be committed to environmental protection, yet environmental policies have not always been enforced.?[19]?(p42) However, maquilas are required to be certified and to provide an environmental impact statement. In Mexico, most maquiladoras are global players that use international standards for waste treatment and disposal that exceed Mexican requirements and that require any waste generated to be re-exported. Although the La Paz Agreement signed by Mexico and the United States in 1983 requires hazardous waste created by United States corporations to be transported back to the United States for disposal, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that only 91 of the 600 maquiladoras located along the Texas-Mexico border have returned hazardous waste to the United States since 1987.[20] This is likely due to the fact that most maquiladoras are factories that perform sewing and assembly of consumer products and many of the materials that are considered hazardous are incorporated into those products.[citation needed]\\r\\nMaquiladoras offer showers and sanitary facilities to workers that often lack running water,[clarification needed] thus reducing waste. The United States Geological Survey, the state of California, and the Imperial County Health Departmentamong others[21]have all asserted that the New River, which flows from Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico near the MexicoÿUnited States border into California's Salton Sea, is \\"...the dirtiest river in America.\\"[22]\\r\\nThe EPA's USÿMexico Border 2012 Program has an extensive plan to help with environmental issues along that border.[23]\\r\\nMaquiladora Slavery,.[1] June 1, 2009","input":"What is the relationship between the maquiladoras and the global economy?"},{"output":"Cretaceous Period","context":"","input":"What time period did the t rex live in?"},{"output":"Book of Genesis","context":"Enoch (/?i?n?k/; Hebrew: ???????, Modern?H?anokh, Tiberian???n?; Arabic: ?????????? ?Akhnkh, [commonly in Qur'nic literature]: ???????? ?Idrؐs) is a figure in Biblical literature. \\"In the seventh generation from Adam,\\"[2] he was considered the author of the Book of Enoch[3] and also called Enoch the scribe of judgment.[4] In addition to an appearance in the Book of Genesis of the Hebrew Bible, Enoch is the subject of many Jewish, Christian, and Muslim writings.\\r\\nEnoch was the son of Jared (Genesis 5:19ÿ21), the father of Methuselah, and the great-grandfather of Noah.

The Christian New Testament has three references to Enoch from the lineage of Seth (Luke 3:37, Hebrews 11:5, Jude 1:14ÿ15).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnoch appears in the Book of Genesis of the Pentateuch as the seventh of the ten pre-Deluge Patriarchs. Genesis recounts that each of the pre-Flood Patriarchs lived for several centuries. Genesis 5 provides a genealogy of these ten figures (from Adam to Noah), providing the age at which each fathered the next, and the age of each figure at death. Enoch is considered by many to be the exception, who is said to \\"not see death\\". (Hebrews 11:5) Furthermore, Genesis 5:22ÿ29 states that Enoch lived 365 years which is extremely short in the context of his peers, who are all recorded as dying at over 700 years of age. The brief account of Enoch in Genesis 5 ends with the cryptic note that \\"he [was] not; for God took him\\".[8]\\r\\nThree extensive apocryphal works are attributed to Enoch:\\r\\nThese recount how Enoch was taken up to Heaven and was appointed guardian of all the celestial treasures, chief of the archangels, and the immediate attendant on God's throne. He was subsequently taught all secrets and mysteries and, with all the angels at his back, fulfils of his own accord whatever comes out of the mouth of God, executing His decrees. Much esoteric literature like the 3rd Book of Enoch identifies Enoch as the Metatron, the angel which communicates God's word. In consequence, Enoch was seen, by this literature, and the Rabbinic kabbala of Jewish mysticism, as having been the one which communicated God's revelation to Moses, in particular, the dictator of the Book of Jubilees.\\r\\nThe Book of Giants is a pseudepigraphical Jewish work from the 3rd century BC and resembles the Book of Enoch. At least six and as many as eleven copies were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls collections.[11]\\r\\nThe third-century BC translators who produced the Greek Septuagint rendered the phrase \\"God took him\\" with the Greek verb metatithemi (ךϫ?Ĳ)[12] meaning moving from one place to another.[13] Sirach 44:16, from about the same period, states that \\"Enoch pleased God and was translated into paradise that he may give repentance to the nations.\\" The Greek word used here for paradise, 'paradeisos' (ϫ?Ѵ?), was derived from an ancient Persian word meaning \\"enclosed garden\\", and was used in the Septuagint to describe the garden of Eden. Later, however, the term became synonymous for heaven, as is the case here.[14]\\r\\nIn classical Rabbinical literature, there are various views of Enoch. One view regarding Enoch was that found in the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, which thought of Enoch as a pious man, taken to Heaven, and receiving the title of Safra rabba (Great scribe). After Christendom was completely separated from Judaism, this view became the prevailing rabbinical idea of Enoch's character and exaltation.[15]\\r\\nAccording to Rashi[16] [from Genesis Rabba[17]], Enoch was a righteous man, but he could easily be swayed to return to do evil. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, hastened and took him away and caused him to die before his time. For this reason, Scripture changed [the wording] in [the account of] his demise and wrote, and he was no longer in the world to complete his years.\\r\\nAmong the minor Midrashim, esoteric attributes of Enoch are expanded upon. In the Sefer Hekalot, Rabbi Ishmael is described as having visited the 7th Heaven, where he met Enoch, who claims that earth had, in his time, been corrupted by the demons Shammazai, and Azazel, and so Enoch was taken to Heaven to prove that God was not cruel.[15] Similar traditions are recorded in Sirach. Later elaborations of this interpretation treated Enoch as having been a pious ascetic, who, called to mix with others, preached repentance, and gathered (despite the small number of people on Earth) a vast collection of disciples, to the extent that he was proclaimed king. Under his wisdom, peace is said to have reigned on earth, to the extent that he is summoned to Heaven to rule over the sons of God. In a parallel with Elijah, in sight of a vast crowd begging him to stay, he ascends to Heaven on a horse.\\r\\nThe New Testament contains three references to Enoch.\\r\\nThe introductory phrase \\"Enoch, the Seventh from Adam\\" is also found in 1 Enoch (1 En. 60:8), though not in the Old Testament.[25] In the New Testament this Enoch prophesies \\"to\\"[b] ungodly men, that God shall come with His holy ones to judge and convict them (Jude 1:14-15).Jude 1:14-15</ref>\\r\\nEarly Christianity contains various traditions concerning the \\"translation\\" of Enoch.\\r\\nRegarding the quotation in Jude, most of early Christianity considered it an independent quotation pre-dating the flood. Regarding the Book of Enoch itself Origen, Jerome and Augustin mention it, but as of no authority. Justin, Athenagoras, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Lactantius, and others borrowed an opinion out of this book of Enoch, that the angels had sexual relations with the daughters of men, of whom they had offspring ('the giants of the past'). Tertullian, in several places, speaks of this book with esteem and would persuade us that it was preserved by Noah during the deluge.\\r\\nAccording to the Figurists (a group of Jesuit missionaries mainly led by Joachim Bouvet into China at the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth century and based on ideas of Matteo Ricci 1552 to 1610),[29][30][31] Fu Xi in China's ancient history is actually Enoch.[32][33][34]\\r\\nEnoch is not counted as a saint in Roman Catholic tradition, though Enoch has a saint's day, July 26, in the Armenian Apostolic Church. The \\"St. Enoch\\" in the place name St. Enoch's Square, Glasgow, is a corruption from the site of a medieval chapel to Saint Teneu, the legendary mother of Saint Mungo, and unconnected with Enoch.\\r\\nEnoch is revered in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and the Enochic texts Jubilees and 1 Enoch regarded as the 13th and 14th books, respectively, of the Tewahedo Old Testament canon.[35] Most churches, including the Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Protestant churches, do not accept the books.\\r\\nSome Church Fathers, like St. John of Damascus, as well as some modern Evangelical commentators consider Enoch to be one of the Two Witnesses in the Book of Revelation due to the fact that he did not die according to Genesis 5:24. Two televangelists holding this view, for example, are Pastor John Hagee of Christians United for Israel and Hebrew Roots Bible teacher Perry Stone.\\r\\nAmong the Latter Day Saint movement and particularly in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Enoch is viewed as having founded an exceptionally righteous city, named Zion, in the midst of an otherwise wicked world. This view is encountered in the Mormon scripture (see Standard Works), the Pearl of Great Price and the Doctrine and Covenants, which states that not only Enoch, but the entire peoples of the city of Zion, were taken off this earth without death, because of their piety. (Zion is defined as \\"the pure in heart\\" and this city of Zion will return to the earth at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.) The Doctrine and Covenants further states that Enoch prophesied that one of his descendants, Noah, and his family, would survive a Great Flood and thus carry on the human race and preserve the Scripture. The Book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price has several chapters that give an account of Enoch's preaching, visions and conversations with God. In these same chapters are details concerning the wars, violence and natural disasters in Enoch's day, and notable miracles performed by Enoch. The Book of Moses is itself an excerpt from Joseph Smith's translation of the Bible, which is published in full, complete with these chapters concerning Enoch, by Community of Christ, as the Holy Scriptures/Inspired Version of the Bible, where it appears as part of the Book of Genesis. D&C 104:24 (CofC) / 107:48-49 (LDS) states that Adam ordained Enoch to the higher priesthood (now called the Melchizedek, after the great high priest) at age 25, that he was 65 when Adam blessed him, and he lived 365 years after that until he was translated, so making him 430 years old when that occurred.\\r\\nAdditionally in LDS theology, Enoch is implied to be the scribe who recorded Adam's blessings and prophecies at Adam-ondi-Ahman, as recorded in D&C 107:53-57 (LDS) / D&C 104:29b (CofC).\\r\\nThe left column lists the Bibles teachings about Enoch, plus some not from the Bible; the right column lists additional information found in the LDS cannon.\\r\\nIn Islam, Enoch (Arabic: ???Akhnkh ????????, [commonly in Islamic literature]: ?Idrؐs ?????????)) is identified with Idris, as for example by the History of Al-Tabari intrepretation and the Meadows of Gold.[36] The Quran contains two references to Idris; in Surah Al-Anbiya (The Prophets) verse number 85, and in Surah Maryam (Mary) verses 56-57:\\r\\nIdris is closely linked in Muslim tradition with the origin of writing and other technical arts of civilization,[37] including the study of astronomical phenomena, both of which Enoch is credited with in the Testament of Abraham.[37] Nonetheless, even aside from the identification of Idris and Enoch, many Muslims still honor Enoch as one of the earliest prophets, regardless of whether they equate him with Idris or not.[38] Thus, views on Enoch are divided into two groups:","input":"Where is enoch first mentioned in the bible?"},{"output":"June 1, 2005","context":"The first season of Dancing with the Stars (U.S.) debuted on ABC on June 1, 2005.

It was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style to a design of Arnolfo di Cambio and was structurally completed by 1436, with the dome designed by Filippo Brunelleschi.[1] The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink, bordered by white, and has an elaborate 19th-century Gothic Revival fa?ade by Emilio De Fabris.\\r\\nThe cathedral complex, in Piazza del Duomo, includes the Baptistery and Giotto's Campanile. These three buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major tourist attraction of Tuscany. The basilica is one of Italy's largest churches, and until the development of new structural materials in the modern era, the dome was the largest in the world. It remains the largest brick dome ever constructed.\\r\\nThe cathedral is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Florence, whose archbishop is currently Giuseppe Betori.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Maria del Fiore was built on the site of Florence's second cathedral dedicated to Saint Reparata[2]; the first was the Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze whose first building was consecrated as a church in 393 by St. Ambrose of Milan. The ancient structure, founded in the early 5th century and having undergone many repairs, was crumbling with age, according to the 14th-century Nuova Cronica of Giovanni Villani,[3] and was no longer large enough to serve the growing population of the city.[3] Other major Tuscan cities had undertaken ambitious reconstructions of their cathedrals during the Late Medieval period, such as Pisa and particularly Siena where the enormous proposed extensions were never completed.\\r\\nThe new church was designed by Arnolfo di Cambio and approved by city council in 1294. Di Cambio was also architect of the church of Santa Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio. He designed three wide naves ending under the octagonal dome, with the middle nave covering the area of Santa Reparata. The first stone was laid on September 9, 1296, by Cardinal Valeriana, the first papal legate ever sent to Florence. The building of this vast project was to last 140 years; Arnolfo's plan for the eastern end, although maintained in concept, was greatly expanded in size.\\r\\nAfter Arnolfo died in 1310, work on the cathedral slowed for thirty years. When the relics of Saint Zenobius were discovered in 1330 in Santa Reparata, the project gained a new impetus. In 1331, the Arte della Lana, the guild of wool merchants, took over patronage for the construction of the cathedral and in 1334 appointed Giotto to oversee the work. Assisted by Andrea Pisano, Giotto continued di Cambio's design. His major accomplishment was the building of the campanile. When Giotto died the January 8th of 1337, Andrea Pisano continued the building until work was halted due to the Black Death in 1348.\\r\\nIn 1349, work resumed on the cathedral under a series of architects, starting with Francesco Talenti, who finished the campanile and enlarged the overall project to include the apse and the side chapels. In 1359, Talenti was succeeded by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini (1360ÿ1369) who divided the center nave in four square bays. Other architects were Alberto Arnoldi, Giovanni d'Ambrogio, Neri di Fioravante and Andrea Orcagna. By 1375, the old church Santa Reparata was pulled down. The nave was finished by 1380, and by 1418, only the dome remained incomplete.\\r\\nOn 18 August 1418, the Arte della Lana announced an architectural design competition for erecting Neri's dome. The two main competitors were two master goldsmiths, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi, the latter of whom was supported by Cosimo de Medici. Ghiberti had been the winner of a competition for a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery in 1401 and lifelong competition between the two remained sharp. Brunelleschi won and received the commission.[4]\\r\\nGhiberti, appointed coadjutator, drew a salary equal to Brunelleschi's and, though neither was awarded the announced prize of 200 florins, was promised equal credit, although he spent most of his time on other projects. When Brunelleschi became ill, or feigned illness, the project was briefly in the hands of Ghiberti. But Ghiberti soon had to admit that the whole project was beyond him. In 1423, Brunelleschi was back in charge and took over sole responsibility.[5]\\r\\nWork started on the dome in 1420 and was completed in 1436. The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene IV on March 25, 1436, (the first day of the year according to the Florentine calendar). It was the first 'octagonal' dome in history to be built without a temporary wooden supporting frame. It was one of the most impressive projects of the Renaissance. During the consecration in 1436, Guillaume Dufay's motet Nuper rosarum flores was performed. The structure of this motet was strongly influenced by the structure of the dome.\\r\\nThe decoration of the exterior of the cathedral, begun in the 14th century, was not completed until 1887, when the polychrome marble fa?ade was completed with the design of Emilio De Fabris. The floor of the church was relaid in marble tiles in the 16th century.\\r\\nThe exterior walls are faced in alternate vertical and horizontal bands of polychrome marble from Carrara (white), Prato (green), Siena (red), Lavenza and a few other places. These marble bands had to repeat the already existing bands on the walls of the earlier adjacent baptistery the Battistero di San Giovanni and Giotto's Bell Tower. There are two side doors: the Doors of the Canonici (south side) and the Door of the Mandorla (north side) with sculptures by Nanni di Banco, Donatello, and Jacopo della Quercia. The six side windows, notable for their delicate tracery and ornaments, are separated by pilasters. Only the four windows closest to the transept admit light; the other two are merely ornamental. The clerestory windows are round, a common feature in Italian Gothic.\\r\\nDuring its long history, this cathedral has been the seat of the Council of Florence (1439), heard the preachings of Girolamo Savonarola and witnessed the murder of Giuliano di Piero de' Medici on Sunday, 26 April 1478 (with Lorenzo Il Magnifico barely escaping death), in the Pazzi conspiracy.\\r\\nThe cathedral of Florence is built as a basilica, having a wide central nave of four square bays, with an aisle on either side. The chancel and transepts are of identical polygonal plan, separated by two smaller polygonal chapels. The whole plan forms a Latin cross. The nave and aisles are separated by wide pointed Gothic arches resting on composite piers.\\r\\nThe dimensions of the building are enormous: building area 8,300 square metres (89,340 square feet), length 153 metres (502 feet), width 38 metres (125 feet), width at the crossing 90 metres (300 feet). The height of the arches in the aisles is 23 metres (75 feet). The height of the dome is 114.5 metres (375.7 feet).[6]\\r\\nBy the beginning of the 15th century, after a hundred years of construction, the structure was still missing its dome. The basic features of the dome had been designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1296. His brick model, 4.6 metres (15.1?ft) high, 9.2 metres (30.2 feet) long, was standing in a side aisle of the unfinished building, and had long been sacrosanct.[7] It called for an octagonal dome higher and wider than any that had ever been built, with no external buttresses to keep it from spreading and falling under its own weight.\\r\\nThe commitment to reject traditional Gothic buttresses had been made when Neri di Fioravanti's model was chosen over a competing one by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini.[9] That architectural choice, in 1367, was one of the first events of the Italian Renaissance, marking a break with the Medieval Gothic style and a return to the classic Mediterranean dome. Italian architects regarded Gothic flying buttresses as ugly makeshifts. Furthermore, the use of buttresses was forbidden in Florence, as the style was favored by central Italy's traditional enemies to the north.[10] Neri's model depicted a massive inner dome, open at the top to admit light, like Rome's Pantheon, but enclosed in a thinner outer shell, partly supported by the inner dome, to keep out the weather. It was to stand on an unbuttressed octagonal drum. Neri's dome would need an internal defense against spreading (hoop stress), but none had yet been designed.\\r\\nThe building of such a masonry dome posed many technical problems. Brunelleschi looked to the great dome of the Pantheon in Rome for solutions. The dome of the Pantheon is a single shell of concrete, the formula for which had long since been forgotten. The Pantheon had employed structural centring to support the concrete dome while it cured [11]. This could not be the solution in the case of a dome this size and would put the church out of use. For the height and breadth of the dome designed by Neri, starting 52 metres (171?ft) above the floor and spanning 44 meters (144?ft), there was not enough timber in Tuscany to build the scaffolding and forms.[12] Brunelleschi chose to follow such design and employed a double shell, made of sandstone and marble. Brunelleschi would have to build the dome out of brick, due to its light weight compared to stone and being easier to form, and with nothing under it during construction. To illustrate his proposed structural plan, he constructed a wooden and brick model with the help of Donatello and Nanni di Banco, a model which is still displayed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo. The model served as a guide for the craftsmen, but was intentionally incomplete, so as to ensure Brunelleschi's control over the construction.\\r\\nBrunelleschi's solutions were ingenious, such as his use of the catenary arch for support.[13] The spreading problem was solved by a set of four internal horizontal stone and iron chains, serving as barrel hoops, embedded within the inner dome: one at the top, one at the bottom, with the remaining two evenly spaced between them. A fifth chain, made of wood, was placed between the first and second of the stone chains. Since the dome was octagonal rather than round, a simple chain, squeezing the dome like a barrel hoop, would have put all its pressure on the eight corners of the dome. The chains needed to be rigid octagons, stiff enough to hold their shape, so as not to deform the dome as they held it together.[8]\\r\\nEach of Brunelleschi's stone chains was built like an octagonal railroad track with parallel rails and cross ties, all made of sandstone beams 43 centimetres (17?in) in diameter and no more than 2.3 metres (7.5?ft) long. The rails were connected end-to-end with lead-glazed iron splices. The cross ties and rails were notched together and then covered with the bricks and mortar of the inner dome. The cross ties of the bottom chain can be seen protruding from the drum at the base of the dome. The others are hidden. Each stone chain was supposed to be reinforced with a standard iron chain made of interlocking links, but a magnetic survey conducted in the 1970s failed to detect any evidence of iron chains, which if they exist are deeply embedded in the thick masonry walls. Brunelleschi also included vertical \\"ribs\\" set on the corners of the octagon, curving towards the center point. The Ribs, 13 feet (4 meters) deep, are supported by 16 concealed ribs radiating from center.[14] The ribs had slits to take beams that supported platforms, thus allowing the work to progress upward without the need for scaffolding.[15]\\r\\nA circular masonry dome can be built without supports, called centering, because each course of bricks is a horizontal arch that resists compression. In Florence, the octagonal inner dome was thick enough for an imaginary circle to be embedded in it at each level, a feature that would hold the dome up eventually, but could not hold the bricks in place while the mortar was still wet. Brunelleschi used a herringbone brick pattern to transfer the weight of the freshly laid bricks to the nearest vertical ribs of the non-circular dome.[16][17][18][19]\\r\\nThe outer dome was not thick enough to contain embedded horizontal circles, being only 60 centimetres (2?ft) thick at the base and 30 centimetres (1?ft) thick at the top. To create such circles, Brunelleschi thickened the outer dome at the inside of its corners at nine different elevations, creating nine masonry rings, which can be observed today from the space between the two domes. To counteract hoop stress, the outer dome relies entirely on its attachment to the inner dome and has no embedded chains.[20]\\r\\nA modern understanding of physical laws and the mathematical tools for calculating stresses were centuries in the future. Brunelleschi, like all cathedral builders, had to rely on intuition and whatever he could learn from the large scale models he built. To lift 37,000 tons of material, including over 4 million bricks, he invented hoisting machines and lewissons for hoisting large stones. These specially designed machines and his structural innovations were Brunelleschi's chief contribution to architecture. Although he was executing an aesthetic plan made half a century earlier, it is his name, rather than Neri's, that is commonly associated with the dome.\\r\\nBrunelleschi's ability to crown the dome with a lantern was questioned and he had to undergo another competition, even though there had been evidence that Brunelleschi had been working on a design for a lantern for the upper part of the dome. The evidence is shown in the curvature, which was made steeper than the original model.[21] He was declared the winner over his competitors Lorenzo Ghiberti and Antonio Ciaccheri. His design (now on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo) was for an octagonal lantern with eight radiating buttresses and eight high arched windows. Construction of the lantern was begun a few months before his death in 1446. Then, for 15 years, little progress was possible, due to alterations by several architects. The lantern was finally completed by Brunelleschi's friend Michelozzo in 1461. The conical roof was crowned with a gilt copper ball and cross, containing holy relics, by Verrocchio in 1469. This brings the total height of the dome and lantern to 114.5 meters (375?ft). This copper ball was struck by lightning on 17 July 1600 and fell down. It was replaced by an even larger one two years later.\\r\\nThe commission for this bronze ball [atop the lantern] went to the sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio, in whose workshop there was at this time a young apprentice named Leonardo da Vinci. Fascinated by Filippo's [Brunelleschi's] machines, which Verrocchio used to hoist the ball, Leonardo made a series of sketches of them and, as a result, is often given credit for their invention.[22]\\r\\nLeonardo might have also participated in the design of the bronze ball, as stated in the G manuscript of Paris \\"Remember the way we soldered the ball of Santa Maria del Fiore\\".[23]\\r\\nThe decorations of the drum gallery by Baccio d'Agnolo were never finished after being disapproved by no one less than Michelangelo.\\r\\nA huge statue of Brunelleschi now sits outside the Palazzo dei Canonici in the Piazza del Duomo, looking thoughtfully up towards his greatest achievement, the dome that would forever dominate the panorama of Florence. It is still the largest masonry dome in the world.[24]\\r\\nThe building of the cathedral had started in 1296 with the design of Arnolfo di Cambio and was completed in 1469 with the placing of Verrochio's copper ball atop the lantern. But the fa?ade was still unfinished and would remain so until the 19th century.\\r\\nThe original fa?ade, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio and usually attributed to Giotto, was actually begun twenty years after Giotto's death.[citation needed] A mid-15th-century pen-and-ink drawing of this so-called Giotto's fa?ade is visible in the Codex Rustici, and in the drawing of Bernardino Poccetti in 1587, both on display in the Museum of the Opera del Duomo. This fa?ade was the collective work of several artists, among them Andrea Orcagna and Taddeo Gaddi. This original fa?ade was completed in only its lower portion and then left unfinished. It was dismantled in 1587ÿ1588 by the Medici court architect Bernardo Buontalenti, ordered by Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici, as it appeared totally outmoded in Renaissance times. Some of the original sculptures are on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo, behind the cathedral. Others are now in the Berlin Museum and in the Louvre. The competition for a new fa?ade turned into a huge corruption scandal. The wooden model for the fa?ade of Buontalenti is on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo. A few new designs had been proposed in later years, but the models (of Giovanni Antonio Dosio, Giovanni de' Medici with Alessandro Pieroni and Giambologna) were not accepted. The fa?ade was then left bare until the 19th century.\\r\\nIn 1864, a competition held to design a new fa?ade was won by Emilio De Fabris (1808ÿ1883) in 1871. Work began in 1876 and was completed in 1887. This neo-gothic fa?ade in white, green and red marble forms a harmonious entity with the cathedral, Giotto's bell tower and the Baptistery, but some think it is excessively decorated.\\r\\nThe whole fa?ade is dedicated to the Mother of Christ.\\r\\nThe three huge bronze doors date from 1899 to 1903. They are adorned with scenes from the life of the Madonna. The mosaics in the lunettes above the doors were designed by Niccol Barabino. They represent (from left to right): Charity among the founders of Florentine philanthropic institutions; Christ enthroned with Mary and John the Baptist; and Florentine artisans, merchants and humanists. The pediment above the central portal contains a half-relief by Tito Sarrocchi of Mary enthroned holding a flowered scepter. Giuseppe Cassioli sculpted the right-hand door.\\r\\nOn top of the fa?ade is a series of niches with the twelve Apostles with, in the middle, the Madonna with Child. Between the rose window and the tympanum, there is a gallery with busts of great Florentine artists.\\r\\nThe Gothic interior is vast and gives an empty impression. The relative bareness of the church corresponds with the austerity of religious life, as preached by Girolamo Savonarola.\\r\\nMany decorations in the church have been lost in the course of time, or have been transferred to the Museum Opera del Duomo, such as the magnificent cantorial pulpits (the singing galleries for the choristers) of Luca della Robbia and Donatello.\\r\\nAs this cathedral was built with funds from the public, some important works of art in this church honour illustrious men and military leaders of Florence:\\r\\n? Lorenzo Ghiberti had a large artistic impact on the cathedral. Ghiberti worked with Filippo Brunelleschi on the cathedral for eighteen years and had a large number of projects on almost the whole east end. Some of his works were the stained glass designs, the bronze shrine of Saint Zenobius and marble revetments on the outside of the cathedral.\\r\\nAbove the main door is the colossal clock face with fresco portraits of four Prophets or Evangelists by Paolo Uccello (1443). This one-handed liturgical clock shows the 24 hours of the hora italica (Italian time), a period of time ending with sunset at 24 hours. This timetable was used until the 18th century. This is one of the few clocks from that time that still exist and are in working order.\\r\\nThe church is particularly notable for its 44 stained glass windows, the largest undertaking of this kind in Italy in the 14th and 15th century. The windows in the aisles and in the transept depict saints from the Old and the New Testament, while the circular windows in the drum of the dome or above the entrance depict Christ and Mary. They are the work of the greatest Florentine artists of their times, such as Donatello, Lorenzo Ghiberti, Paolo Uccello and Andrea del Castagno.\\r\\nChrist crowning Mary as Queen, the stained-glass circular window above the clock, with a rich range of coloring, was designed by Gaddo Gaddi in the early 14th century.\\r\\nDonatello designed the stained-glass window (Coronation of the Virgin) in the drum of the dome (the only one that can be seen from the nave).\\r\\nThe beautiful funeral monument of Antonio d'Orso (1323), bishop of Florence, was made by Tino da Camaino, the most important funeral sculptor of his time.\\r\\nThe monumental crucifix, behind the Bishop's Chair at the high altar, is by Benedetto da Maiano (1495ÿ1497). The choir enclosure is the work of the famous Bartolommeo Bandinelli. The ten-paneled bronze doors of the sacristy were made by Luca della Robbia, who has also two glazed terracotta works inside the sacristy: Angel with Candlestick and Resurrection of Christ.\\r\\nIn the back of the middle of the three apses is the altar of Saint Zanobius, first bishop of Florence. Its silver shrine, a masterpiece of Ghiberti, contains the urn with his relics. The central compartment shows us one of his miracles, the reviving of a dead child. Above this shrine is the painting Last Supper by the lesser-known Giovanni Balducci. There was also a glass-paste mosaic panel The Bust of Saint Zanobius by the 16th-century miniaturist Monte di Giovanni, but it is now on display in the Museum Opera del Duomo.\\r\\nMany decorations date from the 16th-century patronage of the Grand Dukes, such as the pavement in colored marble, attributed to Baccio d'Agnolo and Francesco da Sangallo (1520ÿ26). Some pieces of marble from the fa?ade were used, topside down, in the flooring (as was shown by the restoration of the floor after the 1966 flooding).\\r\\nIt was suggested that the interior of the 45 metre (147?ft) wide dome should be covered with a mosaic decoration to make the most of the available light coming through the circular windows of the drum and through the lantern. Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold, but his death in 1446 put an end to this project, and the walls of the dome were whitewashed. Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment. This enormous work, 3,600?metres2 (38 750?ft2) of painted surface, was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579. The upper portion, near the lantern, representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574. Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators, such as Domenico Cresti, finished the other portions: (from top to bottom) Choirs of Angels; Christ, Mary and Saints; Virtues, Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes; and at the bottom of the cupola: Capital Sins and Hell. These frescoes are considered Zuccari's greatest work. But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques. Vasari had used true fresco, while Zuccari had painted in secco. During the restoration work, which ended in 1995, the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue. All the restoration information along with reconstructed images of the frescos were stored and managed in the Thesaurus Florentinus computer system.[25][26]\\r\\nThe cathedral underwent difficult excavations between 1965 and 1974. The archaeological history of this huge area was reconstructed through the work of Dr. Franklin Toker: remains of Roman houses, an early Christian pavement, ruins of the former cathedral of Santa Reparata and successive enlargements of this church. Close to the entrance, in the part of the crypt open to the public, is the tomb of Brunelleschi. While its location is prominent, the actual tomb is simple and humble. That the architect was permitted such a prestigious burial place is proof of the high esteem he was given by the Florentines.[citation needed]","input":"When was the cathedral of santa maria del fiore built?"},{"output":"16 October 1984","context":"The Bill is a British police procedural television series, first broadcast on ITV from 16 October 1984 until 31 August 2010. The programme originated from a one-off drama, Woodentop, broadcast in August 1983.\\r\\nIn its final year on air, The Bill was broadcast once a week, usually on Tuesdays or Thursdays, in a one-hour format. The programme focused on the lives and work of one shift of police officers, rather than on any particular aspect of police work. The Bill was the second longest-running police procedural television series in the United Kingdom, and among the longest running of any British television series. The title originates from \\"Old Bill\\", a slang term for the police.\\r\\nAlthough highly acclaimed by fans and critics, the series attracted controversy on several occasions. An episode broadcast in 2008 was criticised for featuring fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis. The series has also faced more general criticism concerning its levels of violence, particularly prior to 2009, when it occupied a pre-watershed slot.\\r\\nThe Bill won several awards, including BAFTAs, a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award and Best Drama at the Inside Soap Awards in 2009, this being the series' fourth consecutive win.\\r\\nThroughout its twenty-seven-year run, the programme was always broadcast on the main ITV network. In later years, episodes of the show were repeated on ITV3 on their week of broadcast. The series has also been repeated on other digital stations, including Gold, Alibi, Watch, Dave and Drama.\\r\\nIn March 2010, executives at ITV announced that the network did not intend to recommission The Bill, and that filming on the series would cease on 14 June 2010. The last episode aired on 31 August 2010.\\r\\nOn 9 August 2017 UKTV announced Drama will rerun The Bill from the very beginning airing 14 August 2017 at 12noon.\\r\\nOn 31 October 2017 UKTV bosses announced they were no longer showing early episodes first claiming \\"viewer demand\\" was asking them to move to series 14 and then a few days later stating it was \\"very low viewing figures\\". The decision to jump straight to 1998 caused an angry backlash from viewers and fans on Twitter and Digital Spy who were promised that every episode would be shown.\\r\\nFormer stars Graham Cole and John Iles took to Twitter to state their disappointment with the decision.\\r\\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/bill-fans-angry-drama-channel-222610998.html\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bill was originally conceived by Geoff McQueen in 1983, then a new television writer, as a one-off drama. McQueen had originally titled the production \\"Old Bill\\".[2] It was picked up by Michael Chapman for ITV franchise holder Thames Television, who retitled it \\"Woodentop\\" as part of Thames' \\"Storyboard\\" series of one-off dramas and was broadcast on ITV under the title Woodentop on 16 August 1983.[2] Woodentop starred Mark Wingett as Police Constable Jim Carver and Trudie Goodwin as Woman Police Constable June Ackland of London's Metropolitan Police, both attached to the fictional Sun Hill police station.[2]\\r\\nAlthough originally only intended as a one-off, Woodentop impressed ITV to the extent that a full series was commissioned, first broadcast on 16 October 1984 with one post-watershed episode per week, featuring an hour-long, separate storyline for each episode of the first three series. The first episode of the full series was \\"Funny Ol' Business ÿ Cops & Robbers\\". With serialisation, the name of the show changed from \\"Woodentop\\" to \\"The Bill\\".[2] In its first four years the series was broadcast between July onwards each year, with a 12-week summer break from May until the next July. With a full ensemble cast to explore new characters not featured or just mentioned in \\"\\"Woodentop\\"\\", the focus of the storylines soon shifted away from new recruit Carver and towards Detective Inspector Roy Galloway and Police Sergeant Bob Cryer.\\r\\nThe series then changed to two episodes, each of thirty minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, per week in 1988 (from July 1988 onwards, the series also began being broadcast all year round without a summer break), increasing to three a week beginning in 1993, with the third episode being broadcast on Fridays. In 1998, The Bill returned to hour-long episodes, which later became twice-weekly,[3] with the Friday episode being dropped, at which point the series adopted a much more serialised approach. When Paul Marquess took over as executive producer in 2002, as part of a drive for ratings,[4] the series was revamped, bringing in a more soap opera type feel to many of its stories. Many veteran characters were written out, leading to the Sun Hill fire during 2002. Marquess stated that the clearout was necessary to introduce \\"plausible, powerful new characters\\". As part of the new serial format, much more of the characters' personal lives were explored, however, as Marquess put it, the viewers still \\"don't go home with them\\".[2] The change also allowed The Bill to become more reflective of modern policing with the introduction of officers from ethnic minorities, most notably the new superintendent, Adam Okaro. It also allowed coverage of the relationship of homosexual Sergeant Craig Gilmore and PC Luke Ashton, a storyline which Marquess was determined to explore before rival Merseybeat.[2]\\r\\nIn 2005, Johnathan Young took over as executive producer.[2] The serial format was dropped and The Bill returned to stand-alone episodes with more focus on crime and policing than on the personal lives of the officers. 2007 saw the reintroduction of episode titles, which had been dropped in 2002.[4] In 2009, The Bill moved back to the 9?pm slot it previously held and the theme tune, \\"Overkill\\", was replaced as part of a major overhaul of the series.[4][5]\\r\\nOn 26 March 2010, ITV announced it would be cancelling the series later that year after 26 years on air.[6][7] ITV said that this decision reflected the \\"changing tastes\\" of viewers.[8] The last episode of The Bill was filmed in June 2010 and broadcast on 31 August 2010[9] followed by a documentary titled Farewell The Bill.[10] Fans of the show started a 'Save the Bill' campaign on social networking website Facebook in an effort to persuade ITV to reconsider the cancellation,[11] and some radio broadcasters, including BBC Radio 1's Chris Moyles,[12] presented special features on the programme's cancellation.\\r\\nAt the time of the series' end in August 2010, The Bill was the United Kingdom's longest-running police drama and was among the longest-running of any British television series.[13] The series finale, entitled \\"Respect\\", was aired in two parts and was dedicated to \\"the men and women of the Metropolitan Police Service past and present\\".[14] The finale storyline concerned gang member Jasmine Harris being involved in the murder of fellow member Liam Martin who died in the arms of Inspector Smith after being stabbed.[15] Jasmine is then gang raped because she talked to the police and when Callum Stone found the person responsible he was held at gunpoint. Of the title for the finale, Executive Producer Johnathan Young said \\"It's called \\"Respect\\" and we hope it will respect the heritage of the show\\". The finale episodes featured all the cast and the final scene was specially written so all cast members would be featured. Following the final episode, ITV aired a documentary entitled Farewell The Bill which featured interviews from past and present cast and crew members.[16] The finale was watched by 4.4?million viewers, with Farewell The Bill averaging 1.661?million viewers.[17]\\r\\nThroughout the series, there have been three filming locations for Sun Hill police station. From the first series, the police station consisted of a set of buildings in Artichoke Hill, Wapping, East London.[18] However, these buildings were next to the News International plant and during the winter of 1985ÿ86 there was much industrial action which resulted in some altercations between the strikers and what they thought were the real police but were actually actors working on The Bill. Working conditions got so dire, that the production team realised they needed to find another base to set Sun Hill police station.[19]\\r\\nThe second location was an old record distribution depot in Barlby Road, North Kensington in North West London .[18] Filming began here in March 1987. In 1989, the owners of the Barlby Road site ordered The Bill out, due to their redevelopment plans for the area. After an extensive search, two sites were selected, the favourite being a disused hospital in Clapham.[citation needed] However, this fell through and the second option was chosen ÿ an old wine distribution warehouse in Merton, South West London. The move was made in March 1990 and was disguised on screen by the 'ongoing' refurbishment of Sun Hill police station and then finally the explosion of a terrorist car-bomb in the station car-park, which ended up killing PC Ken Melvin.\\r\\nFilming for the series took place all over London, mainly in South London and particularly the London Borough of Merton, where the Sun Hill set was located.[2] Locations used when the show was filmed on a housing estate included:\\r\\nScenes were often filmed in east London, most notably the London Docklands,[24] with other scenes filmed in Tooting,[25] Greenwich[26] and Croydon.[27]\\r\\nThe Bill is set in and around Sun Hill police station, in the fictional \\"Canley Borough Operational Command Unit\\" in East London. Geoff McQueen, creator of The Bill, claimed that he named Sun Hill after a street name in his home town of Royston, Hertfordshire.[2]\\r\\nThe fictional Sun Hill suburb is located in the fictional London borough of Canley in the East End, north of the River Thames. The Borough of Canley is approximately contiguous to the real-life London Borough of Tower Hamlets,[28] and in the first few years of The Bill, Sun Hill police station was actually stated as being located in Wapping in Tower Hamlets. Sun Hill has a London E1 postcode (the 'address' of Sun Hill police station is given as '2 Sun Hill Road, Sun Hill, Canley E1 4KM'.[29]), which corresponds to the real-life areas of Whitechapel and Stepney.\\r\\nWhen filming The Bill, some scenes were re-enacted indoors with microphones surrounding the actors and the extra sounds being \\"dubbed\\" on later. Some of the more aggressive scenes were also filmed indoors either for dubbing or safety reasons.[30] When filming scenes involving police cars, a camera was attached to the outside of the car which feeds back images to a digital recorder in the back of the vehicle. This technique was used to film the new opening titles of The Bill.[31] The sirens used in the series were added later in the dubbing suite as The Bill did not have permission to use sirens while on location. However,[32] the police uniforms used in the series were genuine, again making The Bill unique amongst police dramas.[2][33][34] When the series ended, London's Metropolitan Police Service, after talks with the production company, bought 400 kilograms of police-related paraphernalia, including flat caps and stab vests etc. to prevent them falling into the hands of criminals or those who would seek to use them for criminal activities after the programme's production ceased.[35]\\r\\nThe Bill is unique amongst police dramas in that it takes a serial format, focussing on the work and lives of a single shift of police officers, rather than on one particular area of police work. Also unique is that The Bill adapted to this format after several series, whereas comparable series started with the serial format.[36]\\r\\nDuring its initial broadcast, The Bill was always shown on ITV. In 2009, STV, ITV's regional franchise in Central and Northern Scotland, opted out of broadcasting the series along with a number of other dramas, a decision that later became the subject of legal proceedings between STV and the main ITV network. The legal dispute was settled on 27 April 2011, with ITV receiving S18 million from STV.[37]\\r\\nAside from repeats of episodes on ITV3, which occurred on the original week of their broadcast, the show has regularly been repeated on other digital stations. Re-runs of the series began on 1 November 1992, when new digital channel UKTV Gold began broadcasting. The channel broadcast repeats of the series for nearly sixteen years, until 6 October 2008, when the channel was given a revamp by the owners of the network. During the sixteen-year period, re-runs of the series covered every episode broadcast between 16 October 1984, and 8 March 2007.[38] On 7 October 2008, UKTV launched a new British drama channel, Alibi, and from this point on, episodes of the series were broadcast in the 8?am slot on the channel. Alibi broadcast episodes until 23 December 2009, when the show was taken from the channel's schedule due to poor viewer feedback. During the fourteen months that the show broadcast on Alibi, the channel covered all of the episodes broadcast between 25 August 1998 and 27 February 2002. On 27 January 2010, UKTV relocated The Bill to one of its more recent entertainment channels, Watch. Watch began by airing the episode \\"Sweet Revenge\\", broadcast on 21 March 2007. Thus, they continued in broadcast order, carrying on from where their predecessor, UKTV Gold, had finished. Through the course of the year, the channel continued to broadcast episodes from the latter years of the show, concluding in November 2010 with the episode \\"Conviction: Judgement Day\\", broadcast on 16 July 2009. Following a short break from the network, the series returned in December 2010, beginning with Episode #001, broadcast on 28 February 2002. This continued on from the broadcast order of episodes repeated on Alibi, carrying on from where the network had finished. As of April 2012, Watch had repeated every single episode from 28 February 2002 to 24 February 2005, and was to begin airing episodes from March 2005. In July 2013 the show started to be broadcast by UKTV channel Drama, starting with episodes from 1998.[39] On 14 August 2017, Drama started showing The Bill from the beginning.\\r\\nThe Bill has been broadcast in over 55 different countries.[2][40]\\r\\nWhen The Bill was first commissioned as a series by ITV, it started with twelve episodes per year, each an hour long with a separate storyline.[2] In 1988 the format changed to year-round broadcast with two thirty-minute episodes per week. In 1993 this expanded to three thirty-minute episodes per week. In 1998 the broadcast format changed to two, one hour episodes each week. Episodes were now recorded in 16:9 widescreen digibeta.[citation needed] In 2009 The Bill began broadcasting in HD and as part of a major revamp, was reduced to broadcasting once a week.[66] The Bill finished in 2010, with 2425 episodes broadcast.\\r\\nThe Bill has broadcast two live episodes. The first was in 2003 to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the pilot, \\"Woodentop\\".[67] The second was in 2005 to celebrate the fiftieth birthday of ITV.[68]\\r\\nThe live episode in 2003 was episode No. 162, originally broadcast on 30 October 2003 at 8pm, and produced with a crew of 200 staff including seven camera crews.[3][67] It was reported to be the first live television broadcast of a programme where filming was not largely confined to a studio.[67] Detective Constable Juliet Becker and Constable Cathy Bradford are being held hostage by a man called Mark. As they are being held hostage in a carrier in the station yard, Cathy Bradford raises the custody suite alarm. When the rest of the station arrive outside, Mark makes it known that he intends to kill Juliet Becker. The police get permission to break into the carrier, only to find that Juliet has been stabbed. She is rushed to hospital, but attempts to resuscitate her fail. The episode was watched by around 11?million viewers.[68] This special was later released onto DVD in United Kingdom 31 October 2011, as part of Network DVD's \\"Soap Box: Volume 1\\".[69]\\r\\nThe live episode in 2005 was episode No. 349, broadcast on 22 September 2005 at 8pm. In this episode, it was revealed that PC Gabriel Kent had assumed a false identity. It is revealed that he has been operating under his brother's name and is, in fact, David Kent. In this episode the \\"real\\" Gabriel Kent arrived in Sun Hill to meet his mother, Sergeant June Ackland. In this episode, Sun Hill police station is hosting a reception party and, as the police arrive, they are taken hostage by a distraught father whose son was killed by a stolen car. A struggle ensues in which a shot is fired, alerting others in the building the incident. After an evacuation of the station, Superintendent Amanda Prosser encourages PC Dan Casper to attempt to overpower the man. As he does so, both Casper and the real Gabriel Kent are shot. The real Gabriel Kent is rushed to hospital where the false Gabriel Kent threatens him to keep the identity switch a secret.\\r\\nA series of special episodes titled The Bill Uncovered were produced to reflect the stories of select characters and events. The first was The Bill Uncovered?: Des and Reg (2004) ÿ The story of the unusual friendship between PC Des Taviner and PC Reg Hollis, traversing their history from Des's first day at Sun Hill to his death in a Sun Hill cell.[70] The second was The Bill Uncovered?: Kerry's Story (2004), the story of PC Kerry Young, who met her death outside Sun Hill.[71] The third special was The Bill Uncovered?: Jim's Story (2005), the story of DC Jim Carver ÿ from his first day at Sun Hill (in the pilot \\"Woodentop\\"). The last was The Bill Uncovered: On The Front Line (2006), in which Superintendent Adam Okaro recounts the extraordinary events that have surrounded Sun Hill over his time in charge.[72] A review of the second of these specials criticised the \\"increasingly degenerative plotlines\\" of the series, and characterised the special as a \\"cheerless outing\\" covering The Bill's \\"travesties of plot\\".[71] All four editions of The Bill Uncovered was released onto DVD in Australia as part of The Bill Series 26 DVD boxset, 30 April 2014.[73]\\r\\nIn 2008, a special programme called \\"The Bill Made Me Famous\\" in light of the show's 25th anniversary was broadcast, which saw former actors and special guest stars telling their accounts of working on the show and how it changed their lives. It included old favourites such as Billy Murray (DS Don Beech), Chris Ellison (DI Frank Burnside) and popular TV personalities such as Paul O'Grady and Les Dennis.\\r\\nA two-part crossover episode with the German series SOKO Leipzig, entitled \\"Proof of Life\\", was broadcast in November 2008.[74]\\r\\nFollowing The Bill's final episode on 31 August 2010, a one-hour special titled Farewell The Bill was broadcast.[75] The special explored the history of the series and gave viewers a behind the scenes look at the filming of the last episode.[75] This special was later release onto DVD in Australia 5 October 2011, along with the last two-part episode \\"Respect\\".[76]\\r\\nThe Bill had a large regular cast to support the number of episodes that were produced each year. Working on The Bill had become something of a comical joke in British acting, with 174 actors having formed part of the series' main cast since the series began.[77] A number of cast members have played multiple roles in the series, and in other British soap operas and dramas.\\r\\nThere are numerous actors who have either appeared on The Bill for some considerable length of time, or on whose careers The Bill has made a significant impact. The following is a concise list of the most notable, an expanded version is available at List of characters of The Bill.\\r\\nThe constant need for minor characters, normally appeared in only a single episode, inevitably led to numerous high profile actors and actresses having guest roles in The Bill. The following actors appeared in the show at least once -\\r\\nThe Bill has become a popular drama in the United Kingdom and in many other countries, most notably in Australia.[36][99] The series attracted audiences of up to six million viewers in 2008 and 2009.[100] Ratings during 2002 peaked after the overhaul of the show which brought about the 2002 fire episode, in which six officers were killed[101] and the 2003 live episode attracted ten million viewers- forty percent of the UK audience share.[102] Immediately following The Bill's revamping and time slot change, it was reported that the programme had attracted 4.5?million viewers, 19% of the audience share, however, it lost out to the BBC's New Tricks[103] with the Daily Mirror later reporting that ITV's schedule change was behind a two million viewer drop in ratings.[104]\\r\\nIn 2001, prior to Paul Marquess' appointment as executive producer, The Bill's ratings had dropped to approximately six million viewers and advertising revenues had fallen, in part due to the ageing demographic of its viewers, leading ITV to order a \\"rejuvenation\\" which saw the series adopt a serial format.[2]\\r\\nIn 2002, The Independent reported that The Bill's Thursday episode was viewed by approximately 7?million people, a fall of approximately 3?million viewers in the space of 6 months.[105] After the cast clearout resulting from the Sun Hill fire in April 2002, BBC News reported that The Bill attracted 8.6?million viewers, the highest figure for the year to that point,[101] and by October 2003, the program had around 8?million viewers each week.[3]\\r\\nIn 2005, The Bill was averaging around 11?million viewers, in comparison to Coronation Street, which was attracting around 10?million viewers.[106]\\r\\nIn 2009, The Daily Mirror reported that The Bill was to be moved to a post-watershed slot to allow it to cover grittier storylines. It was reported that it is the first time in British Television that ITV have broadcast a drama all year in the 9?pm slot.[107] The changeover happened at the end of July 2009. Before the move, The Bill was averaging 5?million viewers between the two episodes each week. BARB reports that the week 12ÿ18 October 2009 saw 3.78?million viewers watch The Bill.[108]\\r\\nThe Bill has achieved a number of awards throughout its time on air, ranging from a BAFTA[109] to the Royal Television Society Awards.[110] and the Inside Soap Awards, particularly the \\"best recurring drama\\" category.[111][112]\\r\\nIn 2010, The Bill was nominated for a Royal Television Society award for Best Soap/Continuing Drama, beating both Coronation Street and Emmerdale on to the nominations list. The only soap to be nominated was EastEnders and the results were announced on 16 March 2010.[113] In 2009 an episode of The Bill won the Knights of Illumination Award for Lighting Design- Drama.[114]\\r\\nIt has been compared to Hill Street Blues due to the similar, serial, format that both series take.[115] However, The Bill has seen little direct competition on British television in the police procedural genre over its twenty-five-year history, though the BBC has twice launched rival series. The first was Merseybeat, which ran from 2001 but was cancelled in 2004 due to poor ratings and problems with the cast.[2][116][117][118] The second, HolbyBlue, launched in 2007, was a spin-off of successful medical drama Holby City (itself a spin-off of the long-running Casualty). It was scheduled to go \\"head to head\\" with The Bill, prompting a brief \\"ratings war\\", however HolbyBlue was also cancelled by the BBC in 2008, again, largely due to poor ratings.[119][120]\\r\\nWhen The Bill started, the majority of the Police Federation were opposed to the programme, claiming that it portrayed the police as a racist organisation, however, feelings towards the programme have now mellowed[34] to the extent that Executive Producer Johnathan Young met with Sir Ian Blair, then Commissioner of the Met in 2006 and it was decided that the editorial relationship between the police and the programme was sufficient. However, Young stressed that The Bill is not \\"editorially bound\\" to the police.[34]\\r\\nDespite better relations with the police, The Bill has still not been without controversy. The Bill has been repeatedly criticised for the high levels of violence portrayed in its scenes, especially prior to 2009 when it occupied a pre-watershed timeslot.[48] Specific story lines have also come under fire in the media, such as that surrounding a gay kiss in 2002,[2] as well as an episode broadcast in March 2008 which featured a fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis, leading the MS Society to brand the plot \\"grossly irresponsible\\".[121]\\r\\nThe series has also been criticised by the tabloid press for the replacing of the iconic theme tune as part of a revamping effort.[122]\\r\\nDuring its 27-year-run, The Bill spawned several spin-off productions and related series in German and Dutch languages, as well as a series of documentaries. The following is a list of the most notable of these.","input":"When did the first episode of the bill air?"},{"output":"4 October 1957","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik 1  (/?sp?tn?k/ or /?sp?tn?k/; \\"Satellite-1\\", or \\"PS-1\\", 楰Ѿҿ쳭ҳ Ťҷҿ-1 or Prosteyshiy Sputnik-1, \\"Elementary Satellite 1\\")[5] was the first artificial Earth satellite.[6]  The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957, orbiting for three weeks before its batteries died, then silently for two more months before falling back into the atmosphere. It was a 58?cm (23?in) diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. Its  radio signal was easily detectable even by radio amateurs,[7] and the 65 inclination and duration of its orbit made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth. This surprise success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, a part of the Cold War. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nTracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave data about the ionosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at about 29,000 kilometres per hour (18,000?mph; 8,100?m/s), taking 96.2 minutes to complete each orbit. It transmitted on 20.005 and 40.002 MHz,[10] which were monitored by radio operators throughout the world. The signals continued for 21 days until the transmitter batteries ran out on 26 October 1957.[4] Sputnik burned up on 4 January 1958 while reentering Earth's atmosphere, after three months, 1440 completed orbits of the Earth,[1] and a distance travelled of about 70?million?km (43?million?mi).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 December 1954, chief Soviet rocket scientist Sergei Korolev proposed a developmental plan for an artificial satellite to Minister of Defence Industry Dimitri Ustinov. Korolev forwarded a report by Mikhail Tikhonravov with an overview of similar projects abroad.[12] Tikhonravov had emphasized that the launch of an orbital satellite was an inevitable stage in the development of rocket technology.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 29 July 1955, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced through his press secretary that the United States would launch an artificial satellite during the International Geophysical Year (IGY).[14] A week later, on 8 August, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union approved the proposal to create an artificial satellite.[15] On 30 August Vasily Ryabikov ÿ the head of the State Commission on R-7 rocket test launches ÿ held a meeting where Korolev presented calculation data for a spaceflight trajectory to the Moon. They decided to develop a three-stage version of the R-7 rocket for satellite launches.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 January 1956 the Council of Ministers approved practical work on an artificial Earth-orbiting satellite. This satellite, named Object D, was planned to be completed in 1957ÿ58; it would have a mass of 1,000 to 1,400?kg (2,200 to 3,100?lb) and would carry 200 to 300?kg (440 to 660?lb) of scientific instruments.[17] The first test launch of \\"Object D\\" was scheduled for 1957.[13] Work on the satellite was to be divided among institutions as follows:[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreliminary design work was completed by July 1956 and the scientific tasks to be carried out by the satellite were defined. These included measuring the density of the atmosphere and its ion composition, the solar wind, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays. These data would be valuable in the creation of future artificial satellites. A system of ground stations was to be developed to collect data transmitted by the satellite, observe the satellite's orbit, and transmit commands to the satellite. Because of the limited time frame, observations were planned for only 7 to 10 days and orbit calculations were not expected to be extremely accurate.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of 1956 it became clear that the complexity of the ambitious design meant that 'Object D' could not be launched in time because of difficulties creating scientific instruments and the low specific impulse produced by the completed R-7 engines (304 sec instead of the planned 309 to 310 sec). Consequently, the government rescheduled the launch for April 1958.[13] Object D would later fly as Sputnik 3.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nFearing the U.S. would launch a satellite before the USSR, OKB-1 suggested the creation and launch of a satellite in AprilÿMay 1957, before the IGY began in July 1957. The new satellite would be simple, light (100?kg or 220?lb), and easy to construct, forgoing the complex, heavy scientific equipment in favour of a simple radio transmitter. On 15 February 1957 the Council of Ministers of the USSR approved this simple satellite, designated 'Object PS'.[21]  This version allowed the satellite to be tracked visually by Earth-based observers, and it could transmit tracking signals to ground-based receiving stations.[21] The launch of two satellites, PS-1 and PS-2, with two R-7 rockets (8K71) was approved, provided that the R-7 completed at least two successful test flights.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe R-7 Semyorka was initially designed as an ICBM by OKB-1. The decision to build it was made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR on 20 May 1954.[22] The R-7 was also known by its GRAU (later GURVO) designation 8K71.[23] At the time, the R-7 was known to NATO sources as the T-3 or M-104,[24] and Type A.[25] A special reconnaissance commission selected Tyuratam for the construction of a rocket proving ground (the 5th Tyuratam range, usually referred to as \\"NIIP-5\\", or \\"GIK-5\\" in the post-Soviet time). The selection was approved on 12 February 1955 by the Council of Ministers of the USSR, but the site would not be completed until 1958.[26] Actual work on the construction of the site began on 20 July by military building units. On 14 June 1956 Sergei Korolev decided to adapt the R-7 rocket to the 'Object D',[27] that would later be replaced by the much lighter 'Object PS'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first launch of an R-7 rocket (8K71 No.5L) occurred on 15 May 1957. A fire began in the Blok D strap-on almost immediately at liftoff, but the booster continued flying until T+98 seconds when the strap-on broke away and the vehicle crashed some 400?km downrange.[28] Three attempts to launch the second rocket (8K71 No.6) were made on 10ÿ11 June, but an assembly defect prevented launch.[29] The unsuccessful launch of the third R-7 rocket (8K71 No.7) took place on 12 July.[28] An electrical short caused the vernier engines to put the missile into an uncontrolled roll which resulted in all of the strap-ons separating 33 seconds into the launch. The R-7 crashed about 7?km from the pad.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe launch of the fourth rocket (8K71 No.8), on 21 August at 15:25 Moscow Time,[28] was successful. The rocket's core boosted the dummy warhead to the target altitude and velocity, reentered the atmosphere, and broke apart at a height of 10?km (6.2?mi) after traveling 6,000?km. On 27 August TASS issued a statement on the successful launch of a long-distance multistage ICBM. The launch of the fifth R-7 rocket (8K71 No.9), on 7 September[28] was also successful, but the dummy was also destroyed on atmospheric re-entry,[30] and hence needed a redesign to completely fulfill its military purpose. The rocket, however, was deemed suitable for satellite launches, and Korolev was able to convince the State Commission to allow the use of the next R-7 to launch PS-1,[31] allowing the delay in the rocket's military exploitation to launch the PS-1 and PS-2 satellites.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 September a modified R-7 rocket, named Sputnik and indexed as 8K71PS,[34] arrived at the proving ground and preparations for the launch of PS-1 began.[35] Compared to the military R-7 test vehicles, the mass of 8K71PS was reduced from 280 tonnes to 272 tonnes; its length with PS-1 was 29.167 metres (95?ft 8.3?in) and the thrust at lift off was 3.90?MN (880,000?lbf).[36] These weight reductions were accomplished by deleting the inertial guidance system, several telemetry measurements, and assorted hardware designed to support a warhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nPS-1 was not designed to be controlled; it could only be observed. Initial data at the launch site would be collected at six separate observatories and telegraphed to NII-4.[32] Located back in Moscow (at Bolshevo), NII-4 was a scientific research arm of the Ministry of Defence dedicated to missile development.[37] The six observatories, designated IP-1 through IP-6, were clustered around the launch site, with the closest (IP-1) situated at a distance of 1?km (0.62?mi) from the launch pad.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nA second, nationwide observation complex was established to track the satellite after its separation from the rocket. Called the Command-Measurement Complex, it consisted of the coordination center in NII-4 and seven distant stations situated along the line of the satellite's ground track.[38] These tracking stations were located at Tyuratam; Sary-Shagan; Yeniseysk; Klyuchi; Yelizovo; Makat in Guryev Oblast; and Ishkup in Krasnoyarsk Krai.[32][38] Stations were equipped with radar, optical instruments, and communications systems. Data from stations were transmitted by telegraphs into NII-4 where ballistics specialists calculated orbital parameters. The complex became an early prototype of the Soviet Mission Control Center.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe observatories used a trajectory measurement system called \\"Tral,\\" developed by OKB MEI, by which they received and monitored data from transponders mounted on the R-7 rocket's core stage.[40] The data was useful even after the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket; Sputnik's location was calculated from the data on the second stage's location which followed Sputnik at a known distance.[41] Tracking of the booster during launch had to be accomplished through purely passive means such as visual coverage and radar detection. R-7 test launches demonstrated that the tracking cameras were only good up to an altitude of 200?km (120?mi) but radar could track it for almost 400?km (250?mi).\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside the Soviet Union, the satellite was tracked by amateur radio operators in many countries.[42] The US government followed it from the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards.[43] The booster rocket was located and tracked by the British using the Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, the only telescope in the world able to do so by radar.[42] Canada's Newbrook Observatory was the first facility in North America to photograph Sputnik 1.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief constructor of Sputnik 1 at OKB-1 was Mikhail S. Khomyakov.[45] The satellite was a 585-millimetre (23.0?in) diameter sphere, assembled from two hemispheres that were hermetically sealed with o-rings and connected by 36 bolts. It had a mass of 83.6 kilograms (184?lb).[46] The hemispheres were 2?mm thick,[47] and were covered with a highly polished 1?mm-thick heat shield[48] made of aluminium-magnesium-titanium AMG6T alloy (\\"AMG\\" is an abbreviation for \\"aluminium-magnesium\\" and \\"T\\" stands for \\"titanium\\"; the alloy is 6% magnesium and 0.2% titanium[49]). The satellite carried two pairs of antennas designed by the Antenna Laboratory of OKB-1 led by Mikhail V. Krayushkin.[18] Each antenna was made up of two whip-like parts: 2.4 and 2.9 meters (7.9 and 9.5?ft) in length,[50] and had an almost spherical radiation pattern,[51] so that the satellite beeps were transmitted with equal power in all directions, making reception of the transmitted signal independent of the satellite's rotation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe power supply, with a mass of 51?kg (112?lb),[52] was in the shape of an octagonal nut with the radio transmitter in its hole.[53] It consisted of three silver-zinc batteries, developed at the All-Union Research Institute of Current Sources (VNIIT) under the leadership of Nikolai S. Lidorenko. Two of these batteries powered the radio transmitter and one powered the temperature regulation system.[52] The batteries had an expected lifetime of two weeks, and operated for 22 days. The power supply was turned on automatically at the moment of the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe satellite had a one-watt, 3.5?kg (7.7?lb)[32] radio transmitting unit inside, developed by Vyacheslav I. Lappo from NII-885, the Moscow Electronics Research Institute,[54][55] that worked on two frequencies, 20.005 and 40.002?MHz. Signals on the first frequency were transmitted in 0.3 sec pulses (under normal temperature and pressure conditions on-board), with pauses of the same duration filled by pulses on the second frequency.[56] Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere. Temperature and pressure were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. A temperature regulation system contained a fan, a dual thermal switch, and a control thermal switch.[54] If the temperature inside the satellite exceeded 36?C (97?F) the fan was turned on and when it fell below 20?C (68?F) the fan was turned off by the dual thermal switch.[51] If the temperature exceeded 50?C (122?F) or fell below 0?C (32?F), another control thermal switch was activated, changing the duration of the radio signal pulses.[54] Sputnik 1 was filled with dry nitrogen, pressurized to 1.3 atm.[34] The satellite had a barometric switch, activated if the pressure inside the satellite fell below 130 kPa, which would have indicated failure of the pressure vessel or puncture by a meteor, and would have changed the duration of radio signal impulse.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile attached to the rocket, Sputnik 1 was protected by a cone-shaped payload fairing, with a height of 80?cm (31.5?in).[32] The fairing separated from both Sputnik and the spent R-7 second stage at the same time as the satellite was ejected.[54] Tests of the satellite were conducted at OKB-1 under the leadership of Oleg G. Ivanovsky.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe control system of the Sputnik rocket was adjusted to an intended orbit of 223 by 1,450?km (139 by 901?mi), with an orbital period of 101.5 min.[58] The trajectory had been calculated earlier by Georgi Grechko, using the USSR Academy of Sciences' mainframe computer.[32][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sputnik rocket was launched on 4 October 1957 at 19:28:34?UTC (5 October at the launch site[1]) from Site No.1 at NIIP-5.[60] Telemetry indicated that the strap-ons separated 116 seconds into the flight and the core stage engine shut down 295.4 seconds into the flight.[58] At shut down, the 7.5 tonne core stage with PS-1 attached had attained an altitude of 223?km (139?mi) above sea level, a velocity of 7,780?m/s (25,500?ft/s) and velocity vector inclination to the local horizon of 0 degrees 24 minutes. This resulted in an initial orbit of 223 kilometres (139?mi) by 950 kilometres (590?mi), with an apogee approximately 500 kilometres (310?mi) lower than intended, and an inclination of 65.1 degrees and a period of 96.2 minutes.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe launch came very close to failurea postflight examination of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2 six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fuel regulator in the booster also failed around 16 seconds into launch, which resulted in excessive RP-1 consumption for most of powered flight and engine thrust 4% above nominal. Core stage cutoff was intended for T+296 seconds, but the premature propellant depletion caused thrust termination to occur one second earlier when a sensor detected overspeed of the empty RP-1 turbopump. There were 375 kilograms (827?lb) of LOX remaining at cutoff.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 19.9 seconds after engine cut-off, PS-1 separated from the second stage[1] and the satellite's transmitter was activated. These signals were detected at the IP-1 station by Junior Engineer-Lieutenant V.G. Borisov, where reception of Sputnik 1's \\"beep-beep-beep\\" tones confirmed the satellite's successful deployment. Reception lasted for two minutes, until PS-1 fell below the horizon.[32][62] The Tral telemetry system on the R-7 core stage continued to transmit and was detected on its second orbit.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe designers, engineers and technicians who developed the rocket and satellite watched the launch from the range.[63] After the launch they drove to the mobile radio station to listen for signals from the satellite.[63]  They waited about 90 minutes to ensure that the satellite had made one orbit and was transmitting, before Korolev called Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first orbit the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) transmitted: \\"As result of great, intense work of scientific institutes and design bureaus the first artificial Earth satellite has been built\\".[65] The R-7 core stage, with a mass of 7.5 tonnes and a length of 26 meters, also reached Earth orbit and was visible from the ground at night as a first magnitude object following the satellite. Deployable reflective panels were placed on the booster in order to increase its visibility for tracking.[64] The satellite, a small, highly polished sphere, was barely visible at sixth magnitude, and thus more difficult to follow optically. A third object, the payload fairing, also achieved orbit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe core stage of the R-7 remained in orbit for two months until 2 December 1957, while Sputnik 1 orbited for three months, until 4 January 1958, having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOur movies and television programs in the fifties were full of the idea of going into space. What came as a surprise was that it was the Soviet Union that launched the first satellite. It is hard to recall the atmosphere of the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviets provided details of Sputnik 1 before the launch but few outside the Soviet Union noticed. After reviewing information publicly available before the launch, the science writer Willy Ley wrote in 1958: \\r\\nIf somebody tells me that he has the rockets to shoot  which we know from other sources, anyway  and tells me what he will shoot, how he will shoot it, and in general says virtually everything except for the precise date  well, what should I feel like if I'm surprised when the man shoots?[67]\\r\\n\\r\\n Organized through the citizen science project Operation Moonwatch, teams of visual observers at 150 stations in the United States and other countries were alerted during the night to watch for the Soviet sphere at dawn and during the evening twilight through binoculars or telescopes as it passed overhead.[68] The USSR asked radio amateurs and commercial stations to record the sound of the satellite on magnetic tape.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nNews reports at the time pointed out that \\"anyone possessing a short wave receiver can hear the new Russian earth satellite as it hurtles over this area of the globe\\".[70] Directions, provided by the American Radio Relay League were to \\"Tune in 20 megacycles sharply, by the time signals, given on that frequency. Then tune to slightly higher frequencies. The 'beep, beep' sound of the satellite can be heard each time it rounds the globe.\\"[71] The first recording of Sputnik 1's signal was made by RCA engineers near Riverhead, Long Island. They then drove the tape recording into Manhattan for broadcast to the public over NBC radio. However, as Sputnik rose higher over the East Coast, its signal was picked up by W2AEE, the ham radio station of Columbia University. Students working in the university's FM station, WKCR, made a tape of this, and were the first to rebroadcast the Sputnik signal to the American public (or whoever could receive the FM station).\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the Soviet Union agreed to use equipment \\"compatible\\" with that of the United States, but later announced the lower frequencies.[68] The White House declined to comment on military aspects of the launch, but said \\"it did not come as a surprise.\\"[72] On 5 October the Naval Research Laboratory announced it had recorded four crossings of Sputnik 1 over the United States.[68] The USAF Cambridge Research Center collaborated with Bendix-Friez, Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to obtain a motion picture of Sputnik's rocket body crossing the pre-dawn sky of Baltimore, broadcast on 12 October by WBZ-TV in Boston.[73] U.S. President Eisenhower obtained photographs of the Soviet facilities from Lockheed U-2 flights conducted since 1956.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe success of Sputnik 1 seemed to have changed minds around the world regarding a shift in power to the Soviets.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe USSR's launch of Sputnik 1 spurred the United States to create the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead.[76][77][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Britain the media and population initially reacted with a mixture of fear for the future, but also amazement about humankind's progress. Many newspapers and magazines heralded the arrival of the Space Age. However, when the Soviet Union launched a second craft containing the dog Laika, the media narrative returned to one of anti-communism and many people sent protests to the Russian embassy and the RSPCA.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik 1 was not immediately used for Soviet propaganda. The Soviets had kept quiet about their earlier accomplishments in rocketry, fearing that it would lead to secrets being revealed and failures being exploited by the West.[80] When the Soviets began using Sputnik in their propaganda, they emphasized pride in the achievement of Soviet technology, arguing that it demonstrated the Soviets' superiority over the West. People were encouraged to listen to Sputnik's signals on the radio[80] and to look out for Sputnik in the night sky. While Sputnik itself had been highly polished, its small size made it barely visible to the naked eye. What most watchers actually saw was the much more visible 26 meter core stage of the R-7.[80] Shortly after the launch of PS-1, Khrushchev pressed Korolev to launch another satellite in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 7 November 1957.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 surprised the American public and shattered the perception, furthered by American propaganda, of the United States as the technological superpower and the Soviet Union as a backward country.[82] Privately, however, the CIA and President Eisenhower were aware of progress being made by the Soviets on Sputnik from secret spy plane imagery.[83] Together with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Army Ballistic Missile Agency built Explorer 1, and launched it on 31 January 1958. Before work was completed, however, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, Sputnik 2, on 3 November 1957. Meanwhile, the televised failure of Vanguard TV3 on 6 December 1957 deepened American dismay over the country's position in the Space Race. The Americans took a more aggressive stance in the emerging space race,[84] resulting in an emphasis on science and technological research and reforms in many areas from the military to education systems.[85] The federal government began investing in science, engineering and mathematics at all levels of education.[82][86]  An advanced research group was assembled for military purposes.[82] These research groups developed weapons such as ICBMs and missile defense systems, as well as spy satellites for the U.S.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, 4 October 1957, the Soviets had orbited the world's first artificial satellite. Anyone who doubted its existence could walk into the backyard just after sunset and see it.\\r\\nInitially U.S. President Eisenhower was not surprised by Sputnik 1. He had been forewarned of the R-7's capabilities by information derived from U-2 spy plane overflight photos, as well as signals and telemetry intercepts.[88][89] The Eisenhower administration's first response was low-key and almost dismissive.[90] Eisenhower was even pleased that the USSR, not the U.S., would be the first to test the waters of the still-uncertain legal status of orbital satellite overflights.[91] Eisenhower had suffered the Soviet protests and shoot-downs of Project Genetrix (Moby Dick) balloons[92] and was concerned about the probability of a U-2 being shot down.[93] To set a precedent for \\"freedom of space\\" before the launch of America's secret WS-117L spy satellites,[94] the U.S. had launched Project Vanguard as its own \\"civilian\\" satellite entry for the International Geophysical Year.[95] Eisenhower greatly underestimated the reaction of the American public, who were shocked by the launch of Sputnik and by the televised failure of the Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 launch attempt. The sense of fear was inflamed by Democratic politicians and professional cold warriors, who portrayed the United States as woefully behind.[96] One of the many books that suddenly appeared for the lay-audience noted seven points of \\"impact\\" upon the nation: Western leadership, Western strategy and tactics, missile production, applied research, basic research, education, and democratic culture.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. soon had a number of successful satellites, including Explorer 1,  Project SCORE, and Courier 1B. However, public reaction to the Sputnik crisis spurred America to action in the Space Race, leading to the creation of both the Advanced Research Projects Agency (renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA in 1972),[97] and NASA (through the National Aeronautics and Space Act),[98] as well as an increase in U.S. government spending on scientific research and education. \\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik also contributed directly to a new emphasis on science and technology in American schools. With a sense of urgency, Congress enacted the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which provided low-interest loans for college tuition to students majoring in math and science.[99][100] After the launch of Sputnik, a poll conducted and published by the University of Michigan showed that 26% of Americans surveyed thought that Russian sciences and engineering were superior to that of the United States. (A year later, however, that figure had dropped to 10% as the U.S. began launching its own satellites into space.)[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne consequence of the Sputnik shock was the perception of a \\"missile gap.\\"[102] This became a dominant issue in the 1960 Presidential campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne irony of the Sputnik event was the initially low-key response of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party newspaper Pravda only printed a few paragraphs about Sputnik 1 on 4 October.[103] In the days following the world's startled response, the Soviets started celebrating their great accomplishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSputnik also inspired a generation of engineers and scientists. Harrison Storms, the North American designer who was responsible for the X-15 rocket plane, and went on to head the effort to design the Apollo Command/Service Module and Saturn V launch vehicle's second stage was moved by the launch of Sputnik to think of space as being the next step for America.[104]  Astronauts Alan Shepard, who was the first American in space, and Deke Slayton later wrote of how the sight of Sputnik I passing overhead inspired them to their new careers.[105] Homer Hickam's memoir Rocket Boys and the movie October Sky tell the story of how a coal miner's son, inspired by Sputnik, started building rockets in the mining town where he lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 inspired United States writer Herb Caen to coin the term \\"beatnik\\" in an article about the Beat Generation in the San Francisco Chronicle on 2 April 1958[106].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag of the Russian city of Kaluga, which, due to its importance as Konstantin Tsiolkovsky's birthplace, is very focused on space, features a small Sputnik in the left section.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least two vintage duplicates of Sputnik 1 exist, built apparently as backup units. One resides just outside Moscow in the corporate museum of Energia, the modern descendant of Korolev's design bureau, where it is on display by appointment only.[107][108] Another is in the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington. Unlike Energia's unit, it has no internal components, but it does have casings and molded fittings inside (as well as evidence of battery wear), which suggest it was built as more than just a model. Authenticated by the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow, the unit was auctioned in 2001 and purchased by an anonymous private buyer who donated it to the museum.[107] Two more Sputnik backups are said to be in the personal collections of American entrepreneurs Richard Garriott[107] and Jay S. Walker.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1959, the Soviet Union donated a replica of Sputnik to the United Nations.[110] There are dozens of other full-size Sputnik replicas, more or less accurate, on display in locations around the world, including the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.;[107] the Frontiers of Flight Museum and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, both in Texas;[107][111] the Armstrong Air and Space Museum and the National Museum of the United States Air Force, both in Ohio; the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas; the California Science Center in Los Angeles; the Science Museum, London; the World Museum in Liverpool; the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia and outside the Russian embassy in Madrid, Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree one-third scale student-built replicas of Sputnik 1 were deployed from the Mir space station between 1997 and 1999. The first, named Sputnik 40 to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, was deployed in November 1997.[74] Sputnik 41 was launched a year later, and Sputnik 99 was deployed in February 1999. A fourth replica was launched, but never deployed, and was destroyed when Mir was deorbited.[107][112]","input":"When did the first satellite go into space?"},{"output":"August 16, 1896","context":"","input":"When was gold discovered in the klondike region of the yukon?"},{"output":"approximately 180","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLennonÿMcCartney (sometimes McCartneyÿLennon) was the songwriting partnership between English musicians John Lennon (9 October 1940?ÿ 8 December 1980) and Paul McCartney (born 18 June 1942) of the Beatles. It is one of the best known and most successful musical collaborations in history, with the Beatles selling over 600 million records, tapes and CDs as of 2004.[1] Between 1962 and 1969, the partnership published approximately 180 jointly credited songs, of which the vast majority were recorded by the Beatles, forming the bulk of their catalogue.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike many songwriting partnerships that comprise separate lyricist and composer,[2] both Lennon and McCartney wrote words and music. Sometimes, especially early on, they would collaborate extensively when writing songs, working \\"eyeball to eyeball\\" as Lennon put it.[3] Later, it became more common for one of the two credited authors to write all or most of a song with limited input from the other.\\r\\nBy an agreement made before the Beatles became famous, Lennon and McCartney were credited equally with songs that either one of them wrote while their partnership lasted. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in United States district court against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the LennonÿMcCartney song catalog beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years.[4][5] McCartney and Sony agreed to a confidential settlement in June 2017.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nLennonÿMcCartney compositions have been the subject of numerous cover versions. According to Guinness World Records, \\"Yesterday\\" has been recorded by more artists than any other song.[7] The Sunday Times called Lennon and McCartney the greatest composers since Ludwig van Beethoven.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pair met on 6 July 1957, at a local church fte, where Lennon was playing with his skiffle group, the Quarrymen. McCartney, brought along by a mutual friend, Ivan Vaughan, impressed Lennon with his ability on the guitar and his version of Eddie Cochran's '20 Flight Rock'. Soon after, Lennon asked McCartney if he would join the Quarrymen. McCartney accepted.[9][10] The duo's first musical idols were the Everly Brothers, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and they learned many of their songs and imitated their sound.[11] Their first compositions were written at McCartney's home (20 Forthlin Road), at Lennon's aunt Mimi's house (251 Menlove Avenue) or at the Liverpool Institute.[12] They often invited friendsincluding George Harrison, Nigel Walley, Barbara Baker, and Lennon's art school colleaguesto listen to performances of their new songs.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nLennon said the main intention of the Beatles' music was to communicate, and that, to this effect, he and McCartney had a shared purpose. Author David Rowley points out that at least half of all LennonÿMcCartney lyrics have the words \\"you\\" and/or \\"your\\" in the first line.[14] In Lennon's 1980 Playboy interview, he said of the partnership,\\r\\n\\r\\n[Paul] provided a lightness, an optimism, while I would always go for the sadness, the discords, the bluesy notes. There was a period when I thought I didn't write melodies, that Paul wrote those and I just wrote straight, shouting rock 'n' roll. But, of course, when I think of some of my own songs\\"In My Life\\", or some of the early stuff, \\"This Boy\\"I was writing melody with the best of them.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorian Todd Compton has noted that there is some truth to Lennon's statement regarding McCartney's optimism. However, it does not tell the whole story, as some of McCartney's most characteristic songs are tragic, or express themes of isolation, such as \\"Yesterday\\", \\"She's Leaving Home\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" or \\"For No One\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Lennon and McCartney often wrote independentlyand many Beatles songs are primarily the work of one or the otherit was rare that a song would be completed without some input from both writers. In many instances, one writer would sketch an idea or a song fragment and take it to the other to finish or improve; in some cases, two incomplete songs or song ideas that each had worked on individually would be combined into a complete song. Often one of the pair would add a middle eight or bridge section to the other's verse and chorus.[17] George Martin attributed the high quality of their songwriting to the friendly rivalry between the two.[18] This approach of the LennonÿMcCartney songwriting teamwith elements of competitiveness and mutual inspiration as well as straightforward collaboration and creative merging of musical ideasis often cited[by whom?] as a key reason for the Beatles' innovation and popular success.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs time went on, the songs increasingly became the work of one writer or the other, often with the partner offering up only a few words or an alternative chord. \\"A Day in the Life\\" is a notable and well-known example of a later Beatles song that includes substantial contributions by both Lennon and McCartney, where a separate song fragment by McCartney (\\"Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head?...\\") was used to flesh out the middle of Lennon's composition (\\"I read the news today, oh boy?...\\"). \\"Hey Jude\\" is another example of a later McCartney song that had input from Lennon: while auditioning the song for Lennon, when McCartney came to the lyric \\"the movement you need is on your shoulder\\", McCartney assured Lennon that he would change the linewhich McCartney felt was nonsensicalas soon as he could come up with a better lyric. Lennon advised McCartney to leave that line alone, saying it was one of the strongest in the song.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen McCartney and Lennon met as teenagers and began writing songs together, they agreed that all songs written by them (whether individually or jointly) should be credited to both of them.[20] The precise date of the agreement is unknown; however, Lennon spoke in 1980 of an informal agreement between him and McCartney made \\"when we were fifteen or sixteen\\".[21] Two songs written (primarily by Lennon) in 1957, \\"Hello Little Girl\\" and \\"One After 909\\", were credited to the partnership when published in the following decade.[22] The earliest Beatles recording credited to LennonÿMcCartney to be officially released is \\"You'll Be Mine\\", recorded at home in 1960 and included on Anthology 1 35 years later.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome other compositions from the band's early years are not credited to the partnership. \\"In Spite of All the Danger\\", a 1958 composition that the band (then The Quarrymen) paid to record to disc, is attributed to McCartney and George Harrison. \\"Cayenne\\", recorded at the same time as \\"You'll Be Mine\\", is a solo McCartney composition. \\"Cry for a Shadow\\", recorded during the Beatles' sessions with Tony Sheridan in June 1961, was written by Lennon and Harrison.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1962, the joint credit agreement was in effect. From the time of the Beatles' first A&R audition in January that year, until Lennon's announcement in September 1969 that he was leaving the band, virtually all songs by McCartney or Lennon were published with joint credit. The only exceptions were a handful of the McCartney compositions released by other artists (viz. \\"Woman\\" by Peter and Gordon in 1966, \\"Cat Call\\" by Chris Barber in 1967, and \\"Penina\\" by Carlos Mendes in 1969).\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the partnership had ended, Lennon and McCartney each gave multiple accounts of their individual contribution to each jointly credited song, and sometimes claimed full authorship. Often their memories of collaboration differed, but often their early and late interviews are in conflict.[24] The following five cases are prominent examples of differences between their recollections:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1962, the Beatles released their first single in the UK, \\"Love Me Do\\", credited to \\"LennonÿMcCartney\\". However, on their next three releases the following year (the single \\"Please Please Me\\", the Please Please Me LP, and the single \\"From Me to You\\"), the credit was given as \\"McCartneyÿLennon\\".[41] With the \\"She Loves You\\" single, released in August 1963, the credit reverted to \\"LennonÿMcCartney\\", and all subsequent official Beatles singles and albums list \\"LennonÿMcCartney\\" (UK) or \\"J.?Lennon/?P.?McCartney\\" (US) as the author of songs written by the two.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976 McCartney's band Wings released their live album Wings over America with songwriting credits for five Beatles songs reversed to place McCartney's name first. Neither Lennon nor Yoko Ono publicly \\"voiced a word of disapproval about it\\".[42] Many years after Lennon's death however, in the late 1990s, McCartney and Ono became involved in a dispute over the credit order.[43] McCartney's 2002 live album, Back in the U.S., also used the credit \\"Paul McCartney and John Lennon\\" for all of the Beatles songs.[44] When Ono objected to McCartney's request for the reversed credit to be used for the 1965 song \\"Yesterday\\", McCartney said that he and Lennon had agreed in the past that the credits could be reversed, if either of them wanted to, on any future releases.[citation needed] In 2003, he relented, saying, \\"I'm happy with the way it is and always has been. Lennon and McCartney is still the rock 'n' roll trademark I'm proud to be a part of ÿ in the order it has always been.\\"[43] An in-depth analysis of the legal issues was the subject of a 66-page article in the Pepperdine Law Review in 2006.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of songs written primarily by the duo and recorded by the Beatles were credited as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German-language versions of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"She Loves You\\" were also credited to additional songwriters for assisting with the translation. \\"Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand\\" was credited to LennonÿMcCartneyÿNicolasÿHellmer and \\"Sie Liebt Dich\\" was credited to LennonÿMcCartneyÿNicolasÿMontague.\\r\\n\\r\\nLennonÿMcCartney, along with the Rolling Stones' songwriting partnership between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, as well as other British Invasion songwriters, inspired changes to the music industry because they were bands that wrote and performed their own music. This trend threatened the professional songwriters that dominated the American music industry. Ellie Greenwich, a Brill Building songwriter, said, When the Beatles and the entire British Invasion came in, we were all ready to say, Look, its been nice, theres no more room for us Its now the self-contained group- males, certain type of material. What do we do?\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe LennonÿMcCartney songwriting partnership makes up the majority of the Beatles' catalogue. The first two UK studio albums included 12 cover tunes and 15 LennonÿMcCartney songs,[51][52] with one track (\\"Don't Bother Me\\") credited to George Harrison.[52] Their third UK album, A Hard Day's Night (1964), is the only original Beatles album made up entirely of LennonÿMcCartney compositions.[53] The next album released, Beatles for Sale (1964), included six covers and eight LennonÿMcCartney originals.[54] The subsequent release, Help! (1965), had two covers and two Harrison compositions along with ten LennonÿMcCartney tracks; it was the last Beatles album to feature a non-original composition until Let It Be, which included an arrangement of the traditional Liverpool folk song \\"Maggie Mae\\". Among the songs in this post-Help! output, Harrison contributed between one and four songs per album, and Starr wrote two songs in total and received a joint credit with Lennon and McCartney for a third (\\"What Goes On\\"). In addition, \\"Flying\\" and \\"Dig It\\" were credited to all four Beatles. The rest of the catalogue came from Lennon and McCartney.\\r\\n\\r\\nLennon and McCartney gave songs to Starr to sing, and to Harrison before he started writing his own material. As for the songs they kept for themselves, each partner mostly sang his own composition, often with the other providing harmonies, or they shared lead vocal. If each contributed a fragment to make a whole song, he might sing his portion, as in the case of \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" and \\"A Day in the Life\\". \\"Every Little Thing\\" is a rare example of a LennonÿMcCartney song in which one member of the partnership was primary composer (McCartney) but the other sang lead vocal (Lennon).[55][56] McCartney sings in unison with Lennon on the verses, but Lennon's vocal is more prominent.[57] McCartney sings the high harmony on the chorus.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral songs credited to LennonÿMcCartney were originally released by artists other than the Beatles, especially those managed by Brian Epstein. Recording a LennonÿMcCartney song helped launch new artists' careers. Many of the recordings below were included on the 1979 compilation album The Songs Lennon and McCartney Gave Away.[58] Beatles versions of some of these were recorded; some were not released until after their split, on compilations such as Live at the BBC (1994) and The Beatles Anthology (1995ÿ96).\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that several songs released during this period were credited solely to Paul McCartney:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following compositions are believed to have been written by Lennon and McCartney, but never officially released by The Beatles or any other artist except as noted below. Many have appeared on Beatles bootlegs; a notable exception being \\"Carnival of Light\\".[62] The list of unreleased songs includes some of the earliest LennonÿMcCartney joint works dating back to The Quarrymen, the group which evolved into the Beatles.[63] Several of these songs were revisited during the Get Back sessions of early 1969.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nBibliography","input":"How many songs did lennon and mccartney write?"},{"output":"January 30, 2000","context":"Super Bowl XXXIV was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion St. Louis Rams and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Tennessee Titans to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1999 season. The Rams defeated the Titans by the score of 23ÿ16, capturing their first Super Bowl win and first NFL championship since 1951.[5] The game, played on January 30, 2000 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, was the fourth Super Bowl to be held a week after the conference championship games (the previous time this happened was Super Bowl XXVIII, and coincidentally that game was also played on January 30 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta).[6]\\r\\nThe Rams entered their second Super Bowl in team history with an NFC-best 13ÿ3 regular season record. It was the franchise's first playoff appearance since 1989, when they were still in Los Angeles. The Titans, who were originally the Houston Oilers, also finished the regular season with a 13ÿ3 record, but advanced to their first Super Bowl in team history after entering the playoffs as a wild-card team. Tennessee finished in second place in the AFC Central division behind the 14ÿ2 Jacksonville Jaguars.[7]\\r\\nThe first two quarters of Super Bowl XXXIV were largely a defensive battle. Despite outgaining the Titans in total offensive yards in the first half, 294ÿ89,[8] the Rams held only a 9ÿ0 halftime lead on three field goals. St. Louis later scored their first touchdown midway through the 3rd quarter to go up 16ÿ0. Tennessee then responded by scoring 16 consecutive points to tie the game with 2:12 left in regulation. This was the largest deficit to be erased in a Super Bowl and the first deficit that was greater than 10 points. On the Rams' ensuing drive, quarterback Kurt Warner completed a 73-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Isaac Bruce to regain the lead. The Titans then drove to the St. Louis 10-yard line with six seconds remaining, but on the final play of the game, Rams linebacker Mike Jones tackled Tennessee wide receiver Kevin Dyson one yard short of the goal line to prevent a potential game-tying touchdown. This play went into NFL lore as One Yard Short, or simply The Tackle.[9] Warner was then named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the sixth player to win both that award and the NFL MVP during the same season.[10][11] At the time, his 414 passing yards and 45 pass attempts without an interception broke Super Bowl records.[12][13][14]\\r\\nThis game is often referred to as the \\"Dot-com Super Bowl\\" due to the large amount of advertisements purchased by dot-com companies.[15][16] This game was later featured as one of NFL's Greatest Games as The Longest Yard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNFL owners awarded Super Bowl XXXIV to Atlanta during their October 31, 1996 meeting held in New Orleans. Other cities under consideration were Miami, Tampa, and Los Angeles. Owners initially planned on selecting only two hosts (XXXIII and XXXIV), but decided to name three after strong showings by the respective delegations. Miami, Atlanta, and Tampa were selected to host XXXIII, XXXIV, and XXXV, respectively.[17][18]\\r\\nThe Rams entered 1999 having been among the league's stragglers for a decade. The reasons are many, including, some suggest, mismanagement by executive John Shaw. The franchise moved to a taxpayer-funded stadium in St. Louis, Missouri for the 1995 season but continued to struggle. In 1997, the team hired Dick Vermeil as their head coach, bringing him back to the NFL after 15 years of retirement. Vermeil had previously turned the Philadelphia Eagles from one of the worst teams in the league into a Super Bowl team in 1980, but his first two seasons in St. Louis were hardly stellar, winning just 5 games in 1997 and 4 in 1998.\\r\\nLittle was expected of the Rams for 1999. Indeed, ESPN The Magazine's 1999 NFL preview predicted the Rams would be the worst team in the NFL; worse even than the Cleveland Browns, who had returned as an expansion team that year.\\r\\nThe Rams proceeded to shock the NFL with an NFC-best 13ÿ3 regular season record and outscored their opponents 526ÿ242, the highest scoring margin (284) of any Super Bowl champion. This was the Rams' first playoff appearance since 1989 and only the second Super Bowl appearance in team history.[19] St. Louis was led by undrafted quarterback Kurt Warner, who started the season as a backup to Trent Green. Green suffered a season-ending knee injury in the preseason, making Warner the team's new starter. Warner previously played for the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League and the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe.[20]\\r\\nIn his first NFL season in 1998, Warner played only one game and threw just 11 passes. But in 1999, he experienced one of the most spectacular seasons ever by a quarterback, recording a passer rating of 109.2, completing 65.1 percent of his passes for 4,353 yards, 41 touchdowns, and just 13 interceptions, and earning the NFL Most Valuable Player Award. Warner was not the only Rams player compiling significant statistics, though. Running back Marshall Faulk, in his first year in St. Louis after spending five seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award. He scored 12 touchdowns, rushed for 1,381 yards, and recorded a team-leading 87 receptions for 1,048 yards. In all, Faulk gained a record 2,429 total yards and became just the second running back in NFL history to gain over 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season (Roger Craig was the first to do it, in 1985).[21] Faulk held the NFL record for yards from scrimmage in a single season until Tennessee's Chris Johnson broke it in 2009.\\r\\nFaulk wasnt the only weapon at Warner's disposal in 1999. Veteran receiver Isaac Bruce was the top Rams receiver with 77 receptions for 1,165 yards and 12 touchdowns. while breakout rookie wide receiver Torry Holt recorded 52 receptions, 788 yards, and 6 touchdowns. Even the team's third wide receiver, Az-Zahir Hakim, was a big contributor by catching 36 passes for 677 yards and 8 touchdowns, while also returning punts for 461 yards and another touchdown. The Rams' offensive line was led by Pro Bowlers Orlando Pace and Adam Timmerman. Timmerman, acquired by the Rams in 1999, had previously won Super Bowl XXXI with the Green Bay Packers. On special teams, receiver Tony Horne returned 30 kickoffs for 892 yards and 2 touchdowns, giving him an NFL-leading 29.7 yards per return average.[22]\\r\\nOverall, St. Louis' offense led the league in total yards gained (6,639), scoring (526 points), and passing touchdowns (42).\\r\\nThe Rams' defense led the league in fewest rushing yards allowed (1,189) and fewest rushing touchdowns allowed (4), while giving up just 242 points. Overall, the defense ranked 4th in the league in fewest total yards allowed (5,056).[21] The line was anchored by Pro Bowl defensive end Kevin Carter and defensive end Grant Wistrom. Carter led the league with 17 sacks, while Wistrom recorded 8.5 sacks and 2 interceptions, returning both for touchdowns and a combined total of 131 yards. Behind them, the Rams had three linebackers: London Fletcher (66 tackles and 3 sacks), Mike Jones (4 interceptions for 96 return yards and 2 touchdowns, and 2 fumble recoveries for 51 return yards and 1 touchdown), and Todd Collins (72 tackles, 1 sack, and 2 interceptions for 16 yards). The secondary was led by Pro Bowler Todd Lyght (6 interceptions), Dexter McCleon (4 interceptions), and rookie Dr Bly (3 interceptions).[23]\\r\\nThe Titans advanced to their first Super Bowl in team history, after originating as a charter member of the American Football League.[24] From 1960 to 1996, the team was owned by Houston, Texas businessman Bud Adams and known as the Houston Oilers. By 1995, however, Adams, like Frontiere, was lured to move his team from Houston, in this case to a new stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. Since this new stadium was not ready until the 1999 season, Adams decided to move his team to Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee in 1997 after playing before small Houston crowds in 1996.\\r\\nThe renamed Tennessee Oilers also played before sparse Memphis crowds, and thus spent the 1998 season playing at Nashville's Vanderbilt Stadium. After the new Adelphia Coliseum (now known as Nissan Stadium) was completed in 1999, the team's name was changed to Tennessee Titans.[25] [26] With Tennessee's Super Bowl appearance, every former AFL team had now played in the Super Bowl, including the original eight AFL teams and two AFL expansion teams: the Miami Dolphins and the Cincinnati Bengals.\\r\\nThe 1999 Titans were led by quarterback Steve McNair and running back Eddie George. McNair had missed five games due to injuries during the season, but he was still able to put up solid numbers, throwing for 2,179 yards and 12 touchdowns with only 8 interceptions. Despite his injury problems, McNair finished the season as the second-leading rusher on the team with 337 yards and scoring 8 touchdowns. George also had an outstanding season, rushing for 1,304 yards, and catching 47 passes for 458 yards (his receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns were all career highs). In all, George scored a grand total of 13 rushing and receiving touchdowns, and was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the 3rd consecutive year.[27]\\r\\nAnother contributor on the Titans' offense was fullback Lorenzo Neal, who frequently served as George's lead blocker and was widely considered one of the best blocking backs in the league. The team did not have any outstanding deep threats, but wide receiver Yancey Thigpen recorded 38 receptions for 648 yards, wide receiver Kevin Dyson had 54 receptions for 658 yards, and tight end Frank Wycheck caught 69 passes for 641 yards. Up front, their line was anchored by Pro Bowl tackle Bruce Matthews.[28]\\r\\nTennessee's defense was also extremely effective. Pro Bowl defensive end Jevon Kearse anchored the line, recording 14.5 sacks to go along with 8 forced fumbles and was named the NFL's Defensive Rookie of the Year. The linebacking corps was led by Eddie Robinson, who recorded 64 tackles and 6 sacks. Their secondary was led by cornerback Samari Rolle, who led the team with 4 interceptions.[29]\\r\\nThe Titans finished the regular season with a 13ÿ3 record (including a home win over the Rams), but finished second behind the 14ÿ2 Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Central. The Jaguars' only two losses were to the Titans, but Tennessee's three losses forced them to enter the playoffs as a wild-card team.[30]\\r\\nPlaying in his first ever NFL playoff game, Warner threw for 395 yards and 5 touchdowns, with 1 interception, as the Rams defeated the Minnesota Vikings, 49ÿ37 in St. Louis, by scoring 35 unanswered points in the second half. Bruce caught 4 passes for 133 yards and a touchdown. Faulk gained 101 combined rushing/receiving yards and scored 2 touchdowns. Although Vikings quarterback Jeff George threw for 423 yards and 4 touchdowns, three of his scores occurred late in the 4th quarter, after the Rams had already put the game away.[31]\\r\\nThe Rams then narrowly defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 11ÿ6 at home, in a hard-fought defensive struggle in the NFC Championship Game. The first half ended with the Rams leading 5ÿ3 on a Jeff Wilkins field goal and after a bad snap by the Buccaneers went through their own end zone for a safety. Tampa Bay then scored a field goal in the 3rd quarter to take the lead. But Warner threw a 30-yard go-ahead touchdown pass to receiver Ricky Proehl with 4:44 left in the game.[32]\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Titans started out their postseason by narrowly defeating the Buffalo Bills, 22ÿ16 in Nashville, on a famous, trick kickoff return play that became known in NFL lore as the Music City Miracle. Tennessee jumped to a 12ÿ0 halftime lead with an Al Del Greco field goal, a safety by Kearse, and a McNair touchdown run. However, Buffalo came back to take the lead, 13ÿ12 with Antowain Smith's two touchdown runs in the second half (the two-point conversion after Smith's second touchdown failed). In the 4th quarter, the Titans regained the lead after Del Greco kicked his second field goal. With 16 seconds left in the game, Bills kicker Steve Christie made what seemed to be the game-winning 41-yard field goal to give his team the lead, 16ÿ15. However, Neal received the ensuing kickoff and handed the ball off to Wycheck, who then lateraled the ball to Dyson on the other side of the field, who eventually ran 75 yards to the end zone for the game-winning touchdown.[33] The play was reviewed to determine whether Wycheck had lateraled the ball to Dyson or made an illegal forward pass. Referee Phil Luckett upheld the original call on the field of a touchdown, giving Tennessee the win.\\r\\nThe Titans then defeated the Indianapolis Colts, 19ÿ16 in Indianapolis. After both teams exchanged field goals in the first half, George scored on a 68-yard touchdown run to give his team a 13ÿ9 lead. Del Greco then kicked two more field goals in the 4th quarter to put the game away. George finished the game with a franchise playoff record 162 rushing yards and a touchdown, while Del Greco made four field goals.[34]\\r\\nThe Titans then eliminated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 33ÿ14, in the AFC Championship Game at Jacksonville. The Jaguars finished the 1999 regular season with a league-best 14ÿ2 record, and advanced to the AFC title game after crushing the Miami Dolphins 62ÿ7 and limiting future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino to just 11 of 25 completions for 95 yards and 1 touchdown, with 2 interceptions. However, Tennessee's defense dominated the Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game, forcing 6 turnovers.[35] Jacksonville led 14ÿ10 at halftime, but the Titans then scored 23 unanswered points on two touchdown runs by McNair, a safety, and Derrick Mason's 80-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. Although McNair passed for only 112 yards and one touchdown with one interception, he rushed for 91 yards and 2 touchdowns on 9 carries. George rushed for 86 yards and caught 3 passes for 19 yards.[36]\\r\\nIn January 2000, two ice storms struck the Atlanta area within a week of each other. The second storm occurred during the week the Super Bowl was hosted. Despite the rare adverse weather conditions, city and state crews kept streets and sidewalks free of ice, and MARTA public transport kept running. The Atlanta region does not receive more ice storms than most other areas of the country, and Super Bowl XXXIV was played indoors and unaffected by the elements. But some residents believe the poor weather during Super Bowl week negatively impacted the city's chances of hosting another Super Bowl, including the bid it lost for the Super Bowl XLIII.[37] That bid included meteorological data showing the rarity of such storms in the area.[38]\\r\\nNashville, home of the Titans, is also the midway point of the Atlanta-St. Louis highway corridor, which contains the entirety of Interstate 24, and uses other highways to complete the route.\\r\\nThis is, to date, the most recent Super Bowl in which neither team had won a Super Bowl before.\\r\\nABC televised the game in the United States with play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color commentator Boomer Esiason. Chris Berman from Disney-owned corporate sibling ESPN hosted all the events. Berman was joined by fellow ESPN analyst Steve Young, while ESPN's Mike Tirico was on hand for the post-game presentation of the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Lesley Visser and Lynn Swann served as sideline reporters.\\r\\nIt was also the first Super Bowl to be aired in high definition and 5.1 Dolby Digital. ABC Sports chose to use the 720p format.[39]\\r\\nIronically, the ABC affiliate in St. Louis, KDNL-TV, has been regarded as one of the network's weakest affiliates since joining the network in 1995[citation needed]. The previous ABC affiliate, KTVI, in contrast, was one of the strongest affiliates[citation needed] ÿ it had become a Fox station in 1995, and thus, has televised the majority of the Rams' games in this period.\\r\\nThe game was later featured as one of the NFL's Greatest Games as The Longest Yard.\\r\\nThe pregame show featured a tribute to \\"The Great American Music of the 20th Century\\". Narrated by the Smothers Brothers, the show highlighted some of the unique American musical styles such as gospel, big band, classical, country and rock. Singers Tina Turner and Travis Tritt along with the Georgia Tech Marching Band and the Georgia Mass Choir performed during the show.\\r\\nCountry singer Faith Hill then sang the national anthem.\\r\\nTo celebrate the 30th anniversary of Super Bowl IV, the following participants of the game were featured during the coin toss ceremony: Bud Grant, Lamar Hunt, Bobby Bell, Paul Krause, Willie Lanier, Alan Page, and Jan Stenerud.[40]\\r\\nThe E-Trade halftime show was produced by Disney and titled \\"Tapestry of Nations\\" after the Epcot parade of the same name. The show, narrated by actor Edward James Olmos, was inspired by Walt Disney World's millennium celebration. It featured a full symphony orchestra conducted by Steven Byess; a multi-generational, 80-person choir; and singers Phil Collins, Christina Aguilera, Enrique Iglesias, Tina Turner, and Toni Braxton.[41]\\r\\nSetlist:[42]\\r\\nThis game is often referred to as the \\"dot-com\\" Super Bowl since it was held during the height of the dot-com bubble, and several Internet companies purchased television commercials. E-Trade ran a commercial featuring a chimpanzee dancing in an E-Trade T-shirt and the text \\"Well, we just wasted 2 million bucks.\\" Lifeminders.com ran a commercial of plain typewritten text beginning with the line \\"This is the worst commercial on the Super Bowl. But it might be the best thing you see tonight.\\" Pets.com famously paid millions for an advertisement featuring a sock puppet, though the company would collapse before the end of the year.[43]\\r\\nThe two teams defenses seemed to dominate most of the first half. The Rams started the game out strong by taking the opening kickoff and marching to the Tennessee 17-yard line. But on third down, safety Blaine Bishop pressured quarterback Kurt Warner to throw an incomplete pass. Then the ensuing field goal attempt failed when punter/holder Mike Horan fumbled the snap. The Titans responded by moving the ball to the St. Louis 29-yard line, aided with running back Eddie George's 32-yard reception. However, they also came up empty after kicker Al Del Greco missed a 47-yard field goal attempt.\\r\\nFor the rest of the half, the Titans were forced to punt on all of their possessions. In contrast, the Rams were able to reach inside the Tennessee 20-yard line on all four of their remaining drives before halftime, but on each one, the Titans' defense forced St. Louis to settle for field goal attempts from kicker Jeff Wilkins, who was successful in making three of them, but missed one attempt from 34 yards. The Rams ended up leading at halftime, 9ÿ0, but their scoring margin over the Titans seemed somewhat small, considering they drove into scoring range on every one of their first-half possessions and outgained Tennessee in total yards, 294ÿ89.\\r\\nBoth teams' offenses started to get going in the second half. The Titans took the opening kickoff of the 3rd quarter and drove 43 yards to the St. Louis 29-yard line. But Tennessee remained scoreless after defensive back Todd Lyght blocked Del Greco's 47-yard field goal attempt. After that, Warner converted a third down situation with a completion to Marshall Faulk, then on the next two plays threw a 31-yard strike to wide receiver Isaac Bruce and a 16-yard completion to tight end Ernie Conwell before finishing the 68-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Torry Holt, giving St. Louis a 16ÿ0 lead. On the completion to Conwell, Bishop combined to make the tackle, but suffered a spinal injury and had to leave the game. The game was delayed for several minutes while Bishop was being treated.\\r\\nTennessee wide receiver Derrick Mason returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards to the 34-yard line. From there, five runs by George good for 24 yards, three completions from quarterback Steve McNair to tight end Frank Wycheck for 15 yards and a run by McNair for two advanced the ball to the St. Louis 25-yard line. Then McNair scrambled 23 yards to the 2-yard line, setting up a 1-yard touchdown run by George two plays later. The touchdown cut the Titans' deficit to 16ÿ6 after McNair's pass to Wycheck on the two-point conversion attempt fell incomplete.[44]\\r\\nThe Titans' first score sparked them to rally. After forcing the Rams to punt on their ensuing possession, a pair of 21-yard completions from McNair to tight end Jackie Harris and wide receiver Isaac Byrd aided a 13-play, 79-yard drive that was capped by George's 2-yard touchdown run to make the score 16ÿ13. The Tennessee defense then forced the Rams to a three-and-out, and Horan's 30-yard punt gave the Titans the ball back at their 47-yard line. The Titans' offense then drove only 28 yards on their ensuing possession, but it was close enough for Del Greco to attempt a 43-yard field goal. This time, Del Greco's kick was good, tying the score at 16ÿ16 with just 2:12 left in the game. The 16-point deficit was the largest deficit to be erased in a Super Bowl and the first greater than 10 points. It was also the first time in any Super Bowl a team down double digits in the 4th quarter had tied the game. Also, however, the Titans only tied the game and hadn't yet gained the lead.\\r\\nThen on the Rams' first play of their ensuing drive, Warner threw a long pass that was caught at the Titans' 38-yard line by Bruce, who then ran it all the way into the end zone for a 73-yard touchdown to give St. Louis a 23ÿ16 lead. Likewise, in the 1951 NFL Championship Game, quarterback Norm Van Brocklin's 73-yard game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Tom Fears broke a 17ÿ17 tie in the fourth quarter and gave the Rams a seven-point victory to win the NFL title.[45] Warner's touchdown pass to Bruce was his only completion of the 4th quarter.\\r\\nThe Titans took over the ball at their own 12-yard line with 1:48 left in the game after committing a holding penalty on the ensuing kickoff. McNair started out the drive with a pair of completions to Mason and Wycheck for gains of 9 and 7 yards to reach the 28-yard line. After an incomplete pass, defensive back Dr Bly's 15-yard facemask penalty while tackling McNair on a 12-yard scramble gave the Titans a 1st down at the St. Louis 45-yard line. On the next play, St. Louis was penalized 5 yards for being offsides, moving the ball to the 40-yard line with 59 seconds left. McNair then ran for 2 yards, then threw a 7-yard completion to wide receiver Kevin Dyson. On the next play, Tennessee nearly lost the ball when Bly stepped in front of a pass intended for Mason, only to have it go right through his arms. Two plays later, with the Titans facing 3rd down and 5 to go, McNair was hit by two Rams defenders, but he escaped and completed a 16-yard pass to Dyson to gain a 1st down at the Rams 10-yard line. Tennessee then used up their final timeout with just six seconds left in the game, giving them a chance for one last play. This final play has gone down in NFL history as simply \\"The Tackle\\".[46][47]\\r\\nThe Titans had just used their final timeout with six seconds remaining. With the ball on the Rams' 10-yard line, the Titans were trailing by a touchdown and had one last opportunity to tie the game. The plan was to use tight end Frank Wycheck as a decoy. Wycheck would run straight up the field on the right side, to lure linebacker Mike Jones away from receiver Kevin Dyson. Dyson would then slant left through the middle of the field. With Jones occupying Wycheck, quarterback Steve McNair would pass the ball to Dyson, who would be open from about five yards out for the score.\\r\\nAs the play began, everything appeared to go as planned. Jones ran with Wycheck up the field at the beginning of the play. However, as the pass was being delivered to Dyson, Jones, who was at the goal line, glanced over his left shoulder and noticed an open Dyson catching the ball. Jones switched directions and ran towards the Titans receiver. Dyson ran directly toward the end zone, but his legs were wrapped up by Jones with about two and a half yards left to the goal line.\\r\\nSince Dyson was being tackled by the legs, there was still the possibility he could reach towards the end zone and get the ball across the goal line. Both players went into a rolling motion as Dyson outstretched his hand with the football towards the goal line in the hopes of scoring the touchdown. Though his reach was close, and the ball mere inches away from the end zone, it was still not enough to score. As the rolling motion came to an end, with Jones now on top of Dyson's legs, his shoulder had touched the ground and, therefore, the game was over. Had Dyson scored and the extra point been converted, it would have been the first Super Bowl ever to go into overtime; it wasn't until 17 years later that the first Super Bowl to go into overtime actually occurred. Alternatively, had Dyson scored, the Titans could have attempted a 2-point conversion for the outright win.\\r\\nConsidering the magnitude of the Super Bowl, and the wild game that preceded it, \\"The Tackle\\" is considered one of the greatest and most exciting game-ending plays in modern NFL history. The image of Dyson stretching the ball towards the goal line with Jones wrapped around him has become a staple of NFL highlights. ESPN.com ranked \\"The Tackle\\" as the 35th greatest moment of the past 25 years in sports (as of 2007).[48] NFL.com ranked Jones' tackle of Dyson as the fourth greatest clutch moment in Super Bowl history.[49] Fox Sports ranked The Tackle as the Greatest Clutch Play in Super Bowl History (as of 2007). Like Dallas Cowboys cornerback Larry Brown, Jones was included on the NFL Network's \\"Top 10 One-Hit Wonders\\" list (Jones was #10, Brown was #3), although Jones also mirrored Brown in having a solid if unspectacular career outside of his Super Bowl heroics.\\r\\nAfter the game, many sports writers commented on Warner's rise from an unknown backup to a Super Bowl MVP, but Warner himself wasn't impressed by it. \\"How can you be in awe of something that you expect yourself to do?\\" Warner pointed out. \\"People think this season is the first time I touched a football; they don't realize I've been doing this for years ÿ just not on this level, because I never got the chance. Sure, I had my tough times, but you don't sit there and say, 'Wow, I was stocking groceries five years ago, and look at me now.' You don't think about it, and when you do achieve something, you know luck has nothing to do with it.\\"\\r\\nHowever, he later told The New York Times \\"I guess it is sort of a storybook ending. When you think about where I was and where I am now, it seems pretty incredible.\\"[50]\\r\\nat Georgia Dome, Atlanta\\r\\nBruce caught 6 passes for 162 yards (3rd highest) and a touchdown, an average of 27 yards per catch.

Among others, he is the only player in NBA history to average 40 and 50 points in a season, score 100 points in a single game, and grab over 2,000 rebounds in a single season. He also won seven scoring, nine field goal percentage, and 11 rebounding titles in addition to an assist title.[1]\\r\\nWith an assortment of fadeaway jump shots, his favorite one-hand finger-roll and powerful dunks in the low post,[2][3] he scored 31,419 points, grabbed 23,924 rebounds, averaging 30.07 points (second-best all time behind Michael Jordan) and 22.9 rebounds (all-time leader) and was also very durable, standing on the hardwood an average 45.8 minutes.[4]\\r\\nFor his feats, Chamberlain was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978, elected one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, ranked #2 in SLAM Magazine's Top 500 NBA Players of all time in 2011[5] and #13 in ESPN list \\"Top North American athletes of the century\\".[6] In honor of Chamberlain, his jerseys have been retired six times, by Overbrook High School, the University of Kansas, the Harlem Globetrotters, and the Warriors, 76ers and Lakers franchises.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChamberlain holds 72 NBA records, 68 by himself.[8] Among his records are several that are considered unbreakable, such as averaging 22.9 rebounds for a career or 50.4 points per game in a season, scoring 100 points or 55 rebounds in a single game, scoring 65 or more points 15 times, 50 or more points 118 times.[7][9] During Chamberlain's time, defensive statistics like blocks and steals had not been recorded yet.

Located on the island is the territorial capital and port of Charlotte Amalie. As of the 2010 census, the population of Saint Thomas was 51,634[2] about 48.5% of the US Virgin Islands total. The district has a land area of 32 square miles (83?km2).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island was originally settled around 1500 BC by the Ciboney people. They were later replaced by the Arawaks and then the Caribs. Christopher Columbus sighted the island in 1493 on his second voyage to the \\"New World\\".\\r\\nThe Dutch West India Company established a post on Saint Thomas in 1657. The first congregation was the St. Thomas Reformed Church, which was established in 1660 and was associated with the Dutch Reformed Church.\\r\\nDenmark-Norway conquered the island in 1666, and by 1672 had established control over the entire island through the Danish West India and Guinea Company. The land was divided into plantations and sugarcane production became the primary economic activity. As a result, the economies of Saint Thomas and the neighboring islands of Saint John and Saint Croix became highly dependent on slave labor and the slave trade. In 1685, the Brandenburgisch-Africanische Compagnie took control of the slave trade on Saint Thomas, and for some time the largest slave auctions in the world were held there.\\r\\nSaint Thomas's fine natural harbor became known as \\"Taphus\\" for the drinking establishments located nearby. (\\"Tap Hus\\" translates as \\"rum shop\\" or \\"tap house\\" referring to the drinking establishments.[4]) In 1691, the primary settlement there was renamed Charlotte Amalie in honor of the wife of Denmark's King Christian V. It was later declared a free port by Frederick V. In December 1732, the first two of many Moravian Brethren missionaries came from Herrnhut Saxony in present-day Germany to minister to them. Distrusted at first by the white masters, they lived among the slaves and soon won their confidence.[5]\\r\\nFrom 1796 a small Jewish community developed in Charlotte Amalie. It established a historic synagogue, Beracha Veshalom Vegmiluth Hasidim, the oldest synagogue in continuous use anywhere in the United States or its external territories.[6]\\r\\nThe first British invasion and occupation of the Danish West Indies occurred at the end of March 1801 when a British fleet arrived at St Thomas. Denmark-Norway accepted the Articles of Capitulation the British proposed and the British occupied the islands without a shot being fired. The British occupation lasted until April 1802, when the British returned the islands to Denmark-Norway.\\r\\nThe second British invasion of the Danish West Indies took place in December 1807 when a British fleet captured St Thomas on 22 December and Santa Cruz on 25 December. Denmark-Norway did not resist and the invasion was bloodless. This British occupation of the Danish West Indies lasted until 20 November 1815, when Britain returned the islands to Denmark.\\r\\nWhile the sugar trade had brought prosperity to the island's free citizens, by the early 19th century Saint Thomas was in decline. The continued export of sugar was threatened by hurricanes, drought, and American competition. Following the Danish Revolution of 1848, slavery was abolished and the resulting rise in labor costs further weakened the position of Saint Thomas's sugar producers.\\r\\nGiven its harbors and fortifications, Saint Thomas still retained a strategic importance, and thus, in the 1860s, during the American Civil War and its aftermath, the United States government considered buying the island and its neighbors from Denmark for $7.5 million. However, the proponents of the purchase failed to gain legislative support for the bid.\\r\\nAs the islands were poorly managed by the Danes, a local islander, David Hamilton Jackson, was instrumental in persuading the Danish to allow the US to purchase the islands of St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix. In 1915, he traveled to Denmark and convinced the King of Denmark to allow freedom of the press in the islands.[7] He began the first newspaper in the islands, known as The Herald. After this, he organized labor unions among the islanders for better working conditions. The islands now have an annual celebration in November to honor the legacy of David Hamilton Jackson.[8]\\r\\nIn 1917, St. Thomas was purchased (along with Saint John and Saint Croix) by the United States for $25 million in gold,[9] as part of a defensive strategy to maintain control over the Caribbean and the Panama Canal during the First World War. The transfer occurred on March 31, 1917, behind Fort Christian before the barracks that now house the Legislature of the U.S Virgin Islands. The baccalaureate service for the transfer was held at the St. Thomas Reformed Church as it was identified as the American church in the Danish West Indies.\\r\\nPercival Wilson Sparks, a U.S. Naval officer, designed the flag that now represents the United States Virgin Islands. Sparks married a local U.S Virgin Island woman, Grace Joseph Sparks; when Sparks' superior, Rear Adm. Summer Ely Wetmore Kitelle, commissioned the design for the flag, P. W. Sparks asked his wife and her sister, Blanche Joseph (later Sasso), to sew the first flag. That flag was used until such time as a factory-produced flag could be acquired.\\r\\nThe flag's inspiration came from the U.S. Presidential seal. Sparks decided to have the eagle facing the olive branches (which represented peace) rather than the arrows (which represented the three islands: St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John). (At the request of Emilie Rose Sparks Gray, a daughter of P.W. Sparks and Grace Sparks, so that the family would have clear and undeniable proof, this piece of history was entered into the Congressional Record in Washington, D.C., on April 30, 1986,[10] by the congressional delegate, Ron de Lugo.) Every year Transfer Day is recognized as a holiday, to celebrate the acquisition of the islands by the United States in 1917.\\r\\nU.S. citizenship was granted to the residents in 1927. The U.S. Department of the Interior took over administrative duties in 1931. American forces were based on the island during the Second World War. In 1954, passage of the U.S. Virgin Islands Organic Act officially granted territorial status to the three islands, and allowed for the formation of a local senate with politics dominated by the American Republican and Democratic parties. Full home rule was achieved in 1970.\\r\\nThe post-war era also saw the rise of tourism on the island. With relatively cheap air travel and the American embargo on Cuba, the numbers of visitors greatly increased. Despite natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo (1989) and Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn (1995), the island's infrastructure continues to improve as the flow of visitors continues. Hotels have been built from the West End to the East End.\\r\\nSaint Thomas is divided into the following subdistricts (with population as per the 2010 U.S. Census):\\r\\nThe island is serviced by the Cyril E. King International Airport.\\r\\nPassenger and limited car-ferry services to neighboring islands such as Water Island, St. John, St. Croix, and the British Virgin Islands run regularly out of the Red Hook Terminal, Charlotte Amalie, and Crown Bay Marina.\\r\\nThe United States Virgin Islands is the only place under United States jurisdiction where the rule of the road is to drive on the left. This was inherited from what was the then-current Danish practice at the time of the American acquisition in 1917. However, because St. Thomas is a U.S. territory, most cars are imported from the mainland United States and therefore the steering column is located on the left side of the vehicle.\\r\\nThe island has many regular taxis from compact size to large vans, as well as open-air, covered trucks called \\"safaris\\" with bench seats.

There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible difference between the two groups is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.\\r\\nPorpoises range in size from the 1.4 metres (4.6?ft) and 54 kilograms (119?lb) vaquita, the smallest cetacean to be discovered, to the 2.3 metres (7.5?ft) and 220 kilograms (490?lb) Dall's porpoise. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism in that the females are larger than males. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Dall's porpoise is one of the fastest cetaceans discovered, with the ability to travel at 41 knots (76?km/h). Porpoises have the ability to produce biosonar and it is their primary sensory system. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep them warm in cold water.\\r\\nPorpoises are not very widespread, with many specialising near the polar regions, usually near the coast. Porpoises feed largely on fish and squid, much like the rest of the odontocetes. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Some porpoises produce a variety of clicks and whistles, which are thought to be primarily for social purposes. A few species, like the harbour porpoise, are highly sociable, but pods generally do not exceed ten individuals for most species.\\r\\nPorpoises were, and still are, hunted by some countries by means of drive hunting. Some species are attributed with high levels of intelligence. At the 2012 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, support was reiterated for a cetacean bill of rights that would list cetaceans as non-human persons. The vaquita nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a predicted population of fewer than 100 individuals, and, since the extinction of the baiji, is considered the most endangered cetacean. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch, competition (from humans), and marine pollution. Porpoises are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPorpoises, along with whales and dolphins, are descendants of land-living ungulates (hoofed animals) that first entered the oceans around 50 million years ago (Mya). During the Miocene (23 to 5 Mya), mammals were fairly modern, meaning they seldom changed physiologically from the time. The cetaceans diversified, and fossil evidence suggests porpoises and dolphins diverged from their last common ancestor around 15 Mya. The oldest fossils are known from the shallow seas around the North Pacific, with animals spreading to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later, during the Pliocene.[1]\\r\\nRecently discovered hybrids between male harbour porpoises and female Dall's porpoises indicate the two species may actually be members of the same genus.[5]\\r\\nPorpoises have a bulbous head, no external ear flaps, a non-flexible neck, a torpedo shaped body, limbs modified into flippers, and a tail fin. Their skull has small eye orbits, small, blunt snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of the head. Porpoises range in size from the 1.4 metres (4.6?ft) and 54 kilograms (119?lb) Vaquita[6] to the 2.3 metres (7.5?ft) and 220 kilograms (490?lb) Dall's porpoise.[7] Overall, they tend to be dwarfed by other cetaceans. Almost all species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males,[8][9] although those physical differences are generally small; one exception is Dall's porpoise.[10][11]\\r\\nOdontocetes possess teeth with cementum cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on the portion of the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole.[9] Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs.[9][12] All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.[9][13]\\r\\nPorpoises have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to those of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers.[14]\\r\\nPorpoises have two flippers on the front, and a tail fin. Although porpoises do not possess fully developed hind limbs, they possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Their flippers, for example, contain four digits. Porpoises are fast swimmers in comparison to seals, which typically cruise at 5ÿ15 kn, or 9ÿ28 kilometres per hour (5.6ÿ17.4?mph); Dall's porpoise, in comparison, can travel at speeds up to 74 kilometres per hour (46?mph).[15] The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, making it impossible for them to turn their head.[16] When swimming, they move their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Flipper movement is continuous. Some species log out of the water, which may allow then to travel faster, and sometimes they porpoise out of the water, meaning jump out of the water. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. They have a very well defined and triangular dorsal fin, allowing them to steer better in the water. Unlike their dolphin counterparts, they are adapted for coastal shores, bays, and estuaries.[9][13]\\r\\nThe porpoise ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equaliser between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, porpoises receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear.[17] The porpoise ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater.[18] Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The large bulge on top of the porpoises head is caused by the melon.[9][19][20][21]\\r\\nThe porpoise eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals.[22] Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.[19]\\r\\nThe olfactory lobes are absent in porpoises, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.[19]\\r\\nPorpoises are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.[19]\\r\\nUnlike most animals, porpoises are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but porpoises cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, so that they may swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.[23]\\r\\nPorpoises are fully aquatic creatures. Females deliver a single calf after a gestation period lasting about a year. Calving takes place entirely under water, with the foetus positioned for tail-first delivery to help prevent drowning. Females have mammary glands, but the shape of a newborn calf's mouth does not allow it to obtain a seal around the nipple instead of the calf sucking milk, the mother squirts milk into the calf's mouth.[24] This milk contains high amounts of fat, which aids in the development of blubber; it contains so much fat that it has the consistency of toothpaste. The calves are weaned at about 11 months of age. Males play no part in rearing calves. The calf is dependent for one to two years, and maturity occurs after seven to ten years, all varying between species. This mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases the probability of each one surviving.[10]\\r\\nPorpoises eat a wide variety of creatures. The stomach contents of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.[13]\\r\\nThe finless porpoise is known to also follow seasonal migrations. It is known that populations in the mouth of the Indus River migrate to the sea from April through October to feed on the annual spawning of prawns. In Japan, sightings of small pods of them herding sand lance onto shore are common year-round.[13]\\r\\nLittle is known about the diets of other species of porpoises. A dissection of three Burmeister's porpoises shows that they consume shrimp and euphausiids. A dissection of a beached Vaquita showed remains of squid and grunts. Nothing is known about the diet of the spectacled porpoise.[13]\\r\\nIn Aristotle's time, the 4th century BCE, porpoises were regarded as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy.[25] His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Natural history. In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The harbour porpoise was one of the most accessible species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises.[26] One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish.[27][28]\\r\\nPorpoises, as opposed to their dolphin counterparts, generally do not thrive in captivity, and are very difficult to maintain. The reopened Miyajima Aquarium in Hiroshima (Japan) houses three finless porpoises.[29] In the Vancouver Aquarium (Canada), there is a harbour porpoise on display, Daisy, who beached herself into Horseshoe Bay in 2008.[30]\\r\\nHarbour porpoises have historically been kept in captivity, under the assumption that they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour porpoises kept worldwide, nearly 100 were kept in Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost all died within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises, and there are only six recorded births (of a harbour porpoise and five finless porpoises). Lack of births in captivity is mainly due the fact that there were few breeding attempts, many were actually kept in isolation and those who were not were often not mature.[13]\\r\\nFinless porpoises have commonly been kept in Japan, as well as China and Indonesia. Ninety four in total have been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, and at least two in Indonesia. Japan has had three establishments designated for breeding them, and there have been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years. This breeding success proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, and this could open up new conservation options.[13]\\r\\nSmall numbers of Dall's porpoises have been kept in captivity in both the United States and Japan. However, these animals consistently failed to thrive. Captive P. dalli repeatedly ran into the walls of their enclosures, refused food, and exhibited skin sloughing. All Dall's porpoises introduced to aquaria died shortly thereafter.[13]\\r\\nPorpoises and other smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an activity known as drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose,[31] thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.[32]\\r\\nPorpoises are highly affected by bycatch. Many porpoises, mainly the vaquita, are subject to great mortality due to gillnetting. Although it is the world's most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita continues to be caught in small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was estimated to be at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size.[33] Harbour porpoises also suffer drowning by gillnetting, but on a less threatening scale due to their high population; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5% due to this.[34]\\r\\nThe fishing market, historically has always had a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna has been known to follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.[35]\\r\\nPorpoises are very sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances,[36] and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment.[36] Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises.[37] Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring.[38] Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.[36]\\r\\nThe military and geologists employ strong sonar and produce an increases in noise in the oceans. Marine mammals that make use of biosonar for orientation and communication are not only hindered by the extra noise, but may race to the surface in panic. This may lead to a bubbling out of blood gases, and the animal then dies because the blood vessels become blocked, so-called decompression sickness.[39] This effect, of course, only occurs in porpoises that dive to great depths, such as Dall's porpoise.[40]\\r\\nAdditionally, civilian vessels produce sonar waves in order to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.[41]\\r\\nThe Harbour porpoise, spectacled porpoise, Burmeister's porpoise, and Dall's porpoise are all listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).[42][43] In addition, the Harbour porpoise is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia.[44] Their conservation statuses are either at least concern or data deficient.[45]\\r\\nAs of 2014, only five hundred and five Yangtze finless porpoises remained in the main section of the Yangtze, with an alarming population density in Ezhou and Zhenjiang. While many threatened species decline rate slows after their classification, population decline rates of the porpoise are actually accelerating. While population decline tracked from 1994 to 2008 has been pegged at a rate of 6.06% annually, from 2006 to 2012, the porpoise population decreased by more than half. Finless porpoise population decrease of 69.8% in just a 22-year span from 1976 to 2000. 5.3%.[46] A majority of factors of this population decline are being driven by the massive growth in Chinese industry since 1990 which caused increased shipping and pollution and ultimately environmental degradation.[47] Some of these can be seen in damming of the river as well as illegal fishing activity. To protect the species, China's Ministry of Agriculture classified the species as being National First Grade Key Protected Wild Animal, the strictest classification by law, meaning it is illegal to bring harm to a porpoise. Protective measures in the Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Nature Reserve has increased its population of porpoises from five to forty in twenty five years. The Chinese Academy of Science's Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology has been working with the World Wildlife Fund to ensure the future for this subspecies, and have placed five porpoises in another well-protected area, the He-wang-miao oxbow.[48] Five protected natural reserves have been established in areas of the highest population density and mortality rates with measures being taken to ban patrolling and harmful fishing gear in those areas. There have also been efforts to study porpoise biology to help specialize conservation through captivation breeding. The Baiji Dolphinarium, was established in 1992 at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan which allowing the study of behavioral and biological factors affecting the finless porpoise, specifically breeding biology like seasonal changes in reproductive hormones and breeding behavior.[49]\\r\\nBecause vaquitas are indigenous to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts with the creation of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat.[50] CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves.[51] CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order to try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering the upper part of the Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.[52]","input":"What is the difference between a dolphin and a porpus?"},{"output":"the internal explosion of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor in Cuba, leading to U.S. intervention in the Cuban War of Independence","context":"","input":"What was a cause of the spanish american war?"},{"output":"April 2, 1992","context":"Globe Life Park in Arlington is a baseball park in Arlington, Texas, located between Dallas and Fort Worth. It is home to the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball and the Texas Rangers Baseball Hall of Fame. It was constructed as a replacement for nearby Arlington Stadium and opened in April 1994 as The Ballpark in Arlington. Ameriquest bought the naming rights to the ballpark on May 7, 2004, and renamed it Ameriquest Field in Arlington. The Rangers severed their relationship with Ameriquest on March 19, 2007, and announced the park would be renamed Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. Globe Life and Accident Insurance Company, a subsidiary of McKinney, Texas-based Torchmark Corporation, bought the naming rights for the facility on February 5, 2014.[5]\\r\\nVoters in Arlington approved extending the sales and hotel taxes in November 2016 to fund Globe Life Field, a new ballpark set to be built in the area adjacent to the current ballpark and open in 2020.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner Eddie Chiles, sold the team to an investment group headed by George W. Bush.[7] The aging Arlington Stadium was outdated and did not have amenities that helped make other baseball franchises more profitable. As a result, the team could not compete with other big-city teams for good players. In an effort to fund the project through public money instead of private financing, the Rangers threatened to leave Arlington. The city of Arlington spent $150,000 on an advertising campaign to persuade voters to approve the funding through a referendum by printing brochures, placing telemarketing calls, and planning a Hands Around Arlington Day.[8] On January 19, 1991, over 65% of voters approved the deal, allowing the city government to cover 71% of the costs ($135 million out of $191 million) of building the new ballpark. The deal called for the city to raise the sales tax by half a cent to go toward construction. Both houses of the Texas Legislature unanimously approved the public purpose of the ballpark, and Texas Governor Ann Richards signed it all into law.[9]\\r\\nAs part of the deal, the city created a separate corporation, the Arlington Sports Facilities Development Authority (ASFDA), to manage construction. Using authority granted to it by the city, the ASFDA seized several tracts of land around the stadium site using eminent domain for parking and future development.[10]\\r\\nConstruction on the stadium, which was dubbed The Ballpark in Arlington, began on April 2, 1992 a short distance away from Arlington Stadium, the stadium it would replace, and the new Ballpark in Arlington opened on April 1, 1994 in an exhibition contest between the Rangers and the New York Mets. The first official game was on April 11 against the Milwaukee Brewers.\\r\\nThe largest crowd to watch a Rangers baseball game was on October 30, 2010, when 52,419 fans watched Game 3 of the 2010 World Series against the San Francisco Giants.\\r\\nOn May 20, 2016, the Rangers announced that they intend to move from Globe Life Park to the new Globe Life Field for the 2020 season.[11] The new air conditioned stadium will feature a retractable roof,[12] which many argue could increase stadium revenue from those who would otherwise not want to sit in the heat during games as the season progresses throughout the hot Texas summer, in particular those that occur in the afternoon. Voting for the new ballpark began on November 8 (the same day as the United States presidential election, 2016) for residents in the city limits of Arlington.[13] On November 8, 2016, the ballpark was passed with a 60% favorable vote.[6] It will open as early as the 2020 season.[6]\\r\\nThe new stadium would be built south of Globe Life Park, on the site of a current surface parking lot between Randol Mill Road and Cowboys Way. Space between the new stadium and Globe Life park will be an entertainment complex called Texas Live!, developed by The Cordish Companies, which is expected to include sports bars, restaurants and a 300-room hotel to be developed in three phases.[14] The first phase, dubbed \\"Rangers Republic\\", would be a two-level venue with multiple restaurants and providing interactive games and authentic memorabilia; the second phase is the Live! Arena, a multi-level venue providing restaurants, a performance stage for concerts, and an outdoor beer garden; Arlington Backyard, the third venue to anchor the entertainment district calls for a large, covered venue that could host concerts, charitable functions, and community events.[15]\\r\\nUnlike Arlington Stadium, city officials will not bulldoze Globe Life Park, but will redevelop the structure as part of the Texas Live! complex. The redevelopment would retain the ballpark's outfield office complex and retain the facade and most of the concourse would be repurposed. Potential uses include repurposing the concourse for condos and retail, as well as turning the current field into an amphitheatre.[16] This will be the team's second move to their third ballpark in Arlington since they began in 1972 (their first ballpark was Arlington Stadium).\\r\\nThe stadium was designed by David M. Schwarz Architectural Services of Washington, D.C. The Rangers chose to build a retro-style ballpark, incorporating many features of baseball's Jewel Box parks. A roofed home run porch in right field is reminiscent of Tiger Stadium, while the white steel frieze that surrounds the upper deck was copied from the pre-1973 Yankee Stadium. The out-of-town scoreboard (removed in 2009 and replaced with a state-of-the-art videoboard) was built into the left-field walla nod to Fenway Park, while the numerous nooks and crannies in the outfield fence are a reminder of Ebbets Field.[17] The arched windows are a reminder of Comiskey Park. However, it has a few distinct features of its own. Several traditional Texas-style stone carvings are visible throughout it. A four-story office building in center field encloses it, with a white steel multilevel facade similar to the facade on the roof.\\r\\nAs the stadium was built on one of the former Arlington Stadium parking lots, the irregular dimensions of the outfield were planned independently, rather than being forced by neighboring structures. The home plate, foul poles (replaced prior to the 2016 season), and bleachers were originally at Arlington Stadium. The Home Plate was inserted into place by Richard Greene (then Mayor of Arlington), Elzie Odom (Head of Arlington Home Run Committee and later Mayor of Arlington), and George W. Bush (former part Rangers owner, later Texas Governor and President of the United States).\\r\\nThe stadium's 810-foot (250?m)-long facades are made of brick and Texas Sunset Red granite. Bas-relief friezes depict significant scenes from the history of both Texas and baseball. The calculus of seating arrangements represented a new economic model for the sport: a critical mass of high-dollar seats close to the infield boost ticket revenue. The stadium has three basic seating tiers: lower, club and upper deck. Two levels of luxury suites occupy spaces behind sliding glass doors above and below the club tier.[18]\\r\\nThe stadium has a large number of obstructed-view seats. In some cases, the view is cut off by an overhang or underhang, and others are directly in front of the foul or support poles. Also, the design of the upper deck leaves it one of the highest in baseball. The view from the grandstand reserved sections in left is particularly obstructed.\\r\\nPrior to the 2012 season, the visitor bullpen was reconfigured to be parallel to the field after the previous visitor bullpen configuration had an excessive amount of heat during hot weather games. To allow construction, a few rows of bleacher sections were removed.\\r\\nGreene's Hill is a sloped section of turf located behind the center field fence at the home field of the ballpark. The Hill serves as a batter's eye, providing a contrasting background behind the pitchers which enables hitters to more easily see the baseball after the pitcher's release. It was originally designed as a picnic area for fans but the Rangers have never initiated this policy. It was named after former Arlington mayor Richard Greene in November 1997. For a couple of years in the 2000s, the Rangers had the \\"T\\" from the Texas Rangers logo mowed into the grass, but this is no longer done. In 2010, the Rangers started a tradition where they had four girls run around on it with giant Texas state flags when the Rangers scored, similar to what many football teams do when their teams score. Unlike most batter's eye, fans are allowed to run onto the hill to catch a home run.\\r\\nThe stadium contains 5,704 club seats and 126 luxury suites.\\r\\nThe field is one of the most notoriously hitter-friendly parks in baseball, due to the high temperatures, relatively short fences, and the design of the stadium which has allowed the area's high winds to swirl and lift balls that wouldn't normally make it out. In truth, the park would give up even more home runs if not for the office building in center and the field being 22 feet (6.7?m) below street level.[20]\\r\\nWith a combination of the park's design and the naturally good hitters who've played for the Rangers, the team has put up some rather high home run totals. In 1996, the Rangers hit 221 home runs. They eclipsed 200 again in 1998 (201), 1999 (230), 2001 (241), 2002 (230), 2003 (239), 2004 (227), and 2005 (260, four short of the all-time record of 264 by the 1997 Seattle Mariners). Many of the Rangers' already-skilled hitters take advantage of this, some even racking up multiple 30+ Home run seasons, such as Ian Kinsler, Adrin Beltr, and Josh Hamilton.[21] The longest home run recorded was 485 feet to right-center field by Rangers LF Josh Hamilton on June 27, 2010.[22]\\r\\nDimensions[23]\\r\\nDespite being hailed as a wonderful venue in its infant years, articles in The Dallas Morning News began to suggest that the ballpark would have been better served by having a dome or retractable roof ÿ much like Minute Maid Park, the home of the Houston Astros ÿ due to the often oppressive heat that settles over Texas during baseball season, with temperatures on the field being in excess of 110. Many argue that the intense heat is a liability in attracting players, particularly starting pitchers.[24]\\r\\nThat being said, it is questionable that retractable roof technology was a good candidate at the time the stadium was constructed, when modern mechanical retractable-roof ballparks like Chase Field, Safeco Field, Minute Maid Park, and Miller Park would not open until several years after it.\\r\\nThe Rangers are planning to open a retractable roof ballpark as early as 2020.[25]\\r\\nOn December 3, 2010, the Rangers announced that extensive renovations to the stadium would be made and ready for the 2011 season.[26] These renovations included:\\r\\nOn April 11, 1994, the first game at the ballpark, Holly Minter, who was posing for a picture while intoxicated, fell 35 feet over a railing in right field, fracturing several bones and causing the team to raise the height of the railings.[27]\\r\\nOn July 6, 2010, firefighter Tyler Morris, leaning over the rail to catch a Nelson Cruz foul ball, fell 30 feet onto the section below him, causing a head injury and a severely sprained ankle to himself and minor injuries to fans he landed on.[28] The game was stopped for 15 minutes while paramedics treated him.[29]\\r\\nOn July 7, 2011, firefighter Shannon Stone, from Brownwood, Texas, was attending the Rangers game against the Oakland Athletics with his six-year-old son, Cooper, when outfielder Josh Hamilton threw him a ball, as he had asked.[27] Reaching for it, he flipped over the railing and fell 20 feet, head-first, onto the concrete behind the out-of-town scoreboard in left field.[27] He was conscious and talking as paramedics tended to him, but he died en route to the hospital.[30] The cause of death was identified as blunt force trauma.[31] This was the fourth fall in the stadium's 17 years of history.[32] A moment of silence was held for him prior to the next day's game, both the Rangers and Athletics wore black ribbons on their uniforms, and the flags at the stadium were flown at half-staff in memory of him.[31] The Rangers Foundation set up a memorial fund for Stone's family.[33]\\r\\nA tarp was placed over the opening through which Stone fell.[31] Rangers team president Nolan Ryan said the height of the railings exceeds the requirement of the building codes but said the team would do \\"whatever it takes\\" to ensure the safety of the fans;[34] on July 20, 2011, the Rangers announced they would raise all railings in the front of seating sections to 42 inches.[35] On August 10, 2011, the team announced it would erect a statue memorializing Stone.[36] Cooper helped unveil the statue on April 5, 2012. It depicts him and his father wearing baseball caps. They are holding hands and looking at each other as if they were talking. The inscription on the statue reads \\"In memory of Shannon Stone and dedicated to all fans who love the game\\".\\r\\nOn September 30, 2011, Cooper threw out the ceremonial first pitch to honor his father before Game 1 of the 2011 ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays.[37][38]\\r\\nIt hosted the 2002 and the 2004 Big 12 Baseball Tournament.\\r\\nScenes from Disney's The Rookie were shot here.\\r\\nIt was the venue for the Dallas/Fort Worth MDA Muscle Walk event that took place on September 20, 2014.[39] This was previously held at AT&T Stadium (formerly Cowboys Stadium) from 2010 to 2013.","input":"When was the ballpark in arlington tx built?"},{"output":"Boston Latin School","context":"","input":"What was the first public school in america?"},{"output":"1940 and 1941","context":"","input":"When did german bombers drop bombs on london?"},{"output":"Union Oyster House","context":"Union Oyster House, open to diners since 1826, is amongst the oldest operating restaurants in the United States of America, and the oldest that has been continuously operating since being opened.

It was formed on 20 May 1882 and renewed periodically until it expired in 1915 during World War I. Germany and Austria-Hungary had been closely allied since 1879. Italy sought support against France shortly after it lost North African ambitions to the French. Each member promised mutual support in the event of an attack by any other great power. The treaty provided that Germany and Austria-Hungary were to assist Italy if it was attacked by France without provocation. In turn, Italy would assist Germany if attacked by France. In the event of a war between Austria-Hungary and Russia, Italy promised to remain neutral.\\r\\nWhen the treaty was renewed in February 1887, Italy gained an empty promise of German support of Italian colonial ambitions in North Africa in return for Italy's continued friendship. Austria-Hungary had to be pressured by German chancellor Otto von Bismarck into accepting the principles of consultation and mutual agreement with Italy on any territorial changes initiated in the Balkans or on the coasts and islands of the Adriatic and Aegean seas. Italy and Austria-Hungary did not overcome their basic conflict of interest in that region despite the treaty. In 1891 attempts were made to join Britain to the Triplice, which, though unsuccessful, were widely believed to have succeeded in Russian diplomatic circles.[1]\\r\\nShortly after renewing the Alliance in June 1902, Italy secretly extended a similar guarantee to France.[2] By a particular agreement, neither Austria-Hungary nor Italy would change the status quo in the Balkans without previous consultation.[a] On 1 November 1902, five months after the Triple Alliance was renewed, Italy reached an understanding with France that each would remain neutral in the event of an attack on the other.\\r\\nWhen Austria-Hungary found itself at war in August 1914 with the rival Triple Entente, Italy proclaimed its neutrality, considering Austria-Hungary the aggressor and defaulting on the obligation to consult and agree compensations before changing the status quo in the Balkans, as agreed in 1912 renewal of the Triple Alliance.[4] Following parallel negotiation with both Triple Alliance, aimed to keep Italy neutral, and the Triple Entente, aimed to make Italy enter the conflict, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. Carol I of Romania, through his Prime Minister Ion I. C. Br?tianu, had also secretly pledged to support the Triple Alliance, but he remained neutral since Austria-Hungary started the war.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man chiefly responsible for the Triple Alliance was Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of Germany. [7]\\r\\nBy the late 1870s, Austrian territorial ambitions in both the Italian peninsula and Central Europe had been thwarted by the rise of Italy and Germany as new national powers. With the decline and failed reforms of the Ottoman Empire, Slavic discontent in the occupied Balkans grew, and both Russia and Austria-Hungary saw an opportunity to expand in this region. In 1876, Russia offered to partition the Balkans, but Hungarian statesman Gyula Andrssy declined because Austria-Hungary was already a \\"saturated\\" state and it could not cope with additional territories.[8] The whole Empire was thus drawn into a new style of diplomatic brinkmanship, first conceived of by Andrssy, centring on the province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a predominantly Slav area still under the control of the Ottoman Empire.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn the heels of the Great Balkan Crisis, Austro-Hungarian forces occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in August 1878 and the empire eventually annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908 as a common holding under the control of the finance ministry, rather than attaching it to either Austria or Hungary. The occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina was a step taken in response to Russian advances into Bessarabia. Unable to mediate between Turkey and Russia over the control of Serbia, AustriaÿHungary declared neutrality when the conflict between the two powers escalated into the Russo-Turkish War (1877ÿ1878).[8] To counter Russian and French interests in Europe, an alliance was concluded with Germany in October 1879 and with Italy in May 1882. World War I started in 1914.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Italy, like some of the other European powers, wanted to set up colonies and build up an overseas empire. With this aim in mind, Italy joined the GermanÿAustrian Alliance to form the Triple Alliance, partly in anger at the French seizure of Tunisia in 1881 (the so-called Schiaffo di Tunisi by Italian press), which many Italians had seen as a potential colony, and partly to guarantee herself support in case of foreign aggression: the main alliance compelled any signatory country to support the other parties if two other countries attacked. At the time, most European countries tried to ensure similar guarantees, and because of the Tunisian crisis, Italy found no other big potential ally than its historical enemy, Austria-Hungary, against which Italy had fought three wars in the 34 years before the first treaty signing.[citation needed]\\r\\nHowever, Italian public opinion remained unenthusiastic about their country's alignment with Austria-Hungary, a past enemy of Italian unification, and whose Italian populated districts in the Trentino and Istria were seen as occupied territories by Italian irredentists. In the years before World War I, many distinguished military analysts predicted that Italy would attack its supposed ally in the event of a large scale conflict. Italy's adherence to the Triple Alliance was doubted and from 1903 plans for a possible war against Rome were again maintained by the Austrian general staff.[9] Mutual suspicions led to reinforcement of the frontier and speculation in the press about a war between the two countries into the first decade of the twentieth century.[10] As late as 1911 Count Franz Conrad von H?tzendorf, chief of the Austrian general staff, was advocating a military preemptive strike against Austria's supposed Italian ally.[11] This prediction was strengthened by Italy's invasion and annexation of Libya, bringing it into conflict with the German-backed Ottoman Empire.\\r\\nKing Carol I of Romania was of German ancestry. That, coupled with his wish to turn Romania into a centre of stability in South-Eastern Europe (as well as his fear of Russian expansion and their competing claims on Bessarabia), led to Romania secretly joining the Triple Alliance on 18 October 1883. Only the King and a handful of senior Romanian politicians knew about it. Romania and Austria-Hungary pledged to help each other in the event of a Russian, Serbian, or Bulgarian attack. There were, however, several disputes between the two countries, the most notable being the policy of Magyarization of Transylvania's Romanian population. Romania did eventually manage to achieve the status of Regional Power in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars and the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest, but less than a year later, World War I started and Romania, after a period of neutrality, in which both the Central Powers and the Allies tried persuading Romania to join their respective sides, eventually joined the Allies in 1916, after being promised Romanian-inhabited Austro-Hungarian lands. Romania's official reason for not siding with the Triple Alliance when the war started was the same as Italy's: the Triple Alliance was a defensive alliance, but Germany and Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive.[12][13][14][15][16]","input":"When did italy and germany form an alliance?"},{"output":"the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic (48,445 km2, 18,705 sq mi), and Creole-speaking Haiti","context":"Hispaniola (Spanish: La Espa?ola; French: Hispaniola; Haitian Creole: Ispayola; Latin: Hispaniola; Tano: Haiti)[3][4] is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, and the most populous island in the Caribbean; the eleventh most populous island in the world.\\r\\nThe 76,192-square-kilometre (29,418?sq?mi) island is divided between two sovereign nations, the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic (48,445 km2, 18,705 sq mi), and Creole-speaking Haiti (27,750 km2, 10,710 sq mi). The only other shared island in the Caribbean is Saint Martin, which is shared between France (Saint-Martin) and the Netherlands (Sint Maarten).\\r\\nHispaniola is the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas, founded by Christopher Columbus on his voyages in 1492 and 1493.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island was called by various names by its native people, the Tano Amerindians. No known Tano texts survive, hence, historical evidence for those names comes to us through three historians: the Italian Pietro Martyr dAnghiera, and the Spaniards Bartolom de las Casas and Gonzalo Fernndez de Oviedo. Fernndez de Oviedo and de las Casas both recorded that the island was called Quizqueia (supposedly \\"Mother of all Lands\\") by the Tano. D'Anghiera added another name, Haiti (\\"Mountainous Land\\"), but later research shows that the word does not seem to derive from the original Arawak Tano language.[3] (Quisqueya is today mostly used in the Dominican Republic.) Although the Tanos' use of Quizqueia is verified, and the name was used by all three historians, evidence suggests that it probably was the Tano name of the whole island, and for a region (now known as Los Haitises) in the northeastern section of the present-day Dominican Republic.\\r\\nWhen Columbus took possession of the island in 1492, he named it Insula Hispana in Latin[7] and La Isla Espa?ola in Spanish,[8] with both meaning \\"the Spanish island\\". De las Casas shortened the name to \\"Espa?ola\\", and when dAnghiera detailed his account of the island in Latin, he rendered its name as Hispaniola.[8] In the oldest documented map of the island, created by Andrs de Morales, Los Haitises is labeled Montes de Hait (\\"Haiti Mountains\\"), and de las Casas apparently named the whole island Haiti on the basis of that particular region,[4] as d'Anghiera states that the name of one part was given to the whole island.[3]\\r\\nDue to Tano, Spanish and French influences on the island, historically the whole island was often referred to as Haiti, Hayti, Santo Domingo, St. Domingue, or San Domingo. The colonial terms Saint-Domingue and Santo Domingo are sometimes still applied to the whole island, though these names refer, respectively, to the colonies that became Haiti and the Dominican Republic.[9] Since Anghiera's literary work was translated into English and French soon after being written, the name \\"Hispaniola\\" became the most frequently used term in English-speaking countries for the island in scientific and cartographic works. In 1918, the United States occupation government, led by Harry Shepard Knapp, obliged the use of the name Hispaniola on the island, and recommended the use of that name to the National Geographic Society.[10]\\r\\nThe name Ha?ti was adopted by Haitian revolutionary Jean-Jacques Dessalines in 1804, as the official name of independent Saint-Domingue, as a tribute to the Amerindian predecessors. It was also adopted as the official name of independent Santo Domingo, as the Republic of Spanish Haiti, a state that existed from November 1821 until its annexation by Haiti in February 1822.[11][12]\\r\\nChristopher Columbus inadvertently landed on the island during his first voyage across the Atlantic in 1492, where his flagship, the Santa Maria, sank after running aground on December 25. A contingent of men were left at an outpost christened La Navidad, on the north coast of present-day Puerto Plata. On his return the following year,[13] following the destruction of La Navidad by the local population, Columbus quickly established a second compound farther east in present-day Dominican Republic, La Isabela.\\r\\nThe island was inhabited by the Tano, one of the indigenous Arawak peoples. The Taino were at first tolerant of Columbus and his crew, and helped him to construct La Navidad on what is now M?le-Saint-Nicolas, Haiti, in December 1492. European colonization of the island began in earnest the following year, when 1,300 men arrived from Spain under the watch of Bartolomeo Columbus. In 1496 the town of Nueva Isabela was founded. After being destroyed by a hurricane, it was rebuilt on the opposite side of the Ozama River and called Santo Domingo. It is the oldest permanent European settlement in the Americas.\\r\\nSeveral 16th century writers estimated the 1492 population of Hispaniola at over 1 million people.[14] Twentieth-century estimates of the figure range from 60,000 to 8,000,000, but center around the 500,000 to 1,000,000 range.[14] Harsh enslavement by Spanish colonists, as well as redirection of food supplies and labor towards the colonists, had a devastating impact on both mortality and fertility over the first quarter century.[15] Colonial administrators and Dominican and Hyeronimite priests observed that the search for gold and agrarian enslavement through the encomienda system were depressing population.[15] Demographic data from two provinces in 1514 shows a low birth rate consistent with a 3.5% annual population decline. Just 14,000 Tanos survived in 1517.[16] In 1503 the colony began to import African slaves, believing them more capable of performing physical labor.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first documented outbreak of smallpox, previously an Eastern hemisphere disease, on Hispaniola occurred in December 1518 among enslaved African miners.[15][17] Some scholars speculate that European diseases arrived before this date, but there is no compelling evidence for an outbreak.[15] The natives had no immunity to European diseases, including smallpox.[18][19] By May 1519, as many as one-third of the remaining Tanos had died.[17]\\r\\nChristopher Columbus brought sugar cane on his second voyage to the island. Molasses was the chief product. Diego Colon's plantation had 40 African slaves in 1522. By 1526, 19 mills were in operation from Azua to Santo Domingo.[20]:224\\r\\nIn 1574, a census taken of the Greater Antilles reported 1,000 Spaniards and 12,000 African slaves on Hispaniola.[21]\\r\\nAs Spain conquered new regions on the mainland of the Americas (Spanish Main), its interest in Hispaniola waned, and the colonys population grew slowly. By the early 17th century, the island and its smaller neighbors (notably Tortuga) became regular stopping points for Caribbean pirates. In 1606, the government of Philip III ordered all inhabitants of Hispaniola to move close to Santo Domingo, to avoid interaction with pirates. Rather than secure the island, his action meant that French, English and Dutch pirates established their own bases on the abandoned north and west coasts of the island.\\r\\nIn 1665, French colonization of the island was officially recognized by King Louis?XIV. The French colony was given the name Saint-Domingue. In the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, Spain formally ceded the western third of the island to France.[22][23] Saint-Domingue quickly came to overshadow the east in both wealth and population. Nicknamed the \\"Pearl of the Antilles,\\" it became the richest and most prosperous colony in the West Indies, with a system of human enslavement used to grow and harvest sugar cane, during a time when demand for sugar was high in Europe. Slavery kept prices low and profit was maximized at the expense of human lives. It was an important port in the Americas for goods and products flowing to and from France and Europe.\\r\\nWith the treaty of Peace of Basel, revolutionary France emerged as a major European power. In the second 1795 Treaty of Basel (July 22), Spain ceded the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, later to become the Dominican Republic. French settlers had begun to colonize some areas in the Spanish side of the territory.\\r\\nEuropean colonists often died young due to tropical fevers, as well as from violent slave resistance in the late eighteenth century. When the French Revolution abolished slavery in the colonies on February 4, 1794, it was a European first,[24] and when Napoleon reimposed slavery in 1802 it led to a major upheaval by the emancipated black slaves.\\r\\nThousands of the French troops sent by Napoleon to reestablish slavery succumbed to yellow fever during the summer months, and more than half of the French army died because of disease.[25] After the French removed the surviving 7,000 troops in late 1803, the leaders of the revolution declared western Hispaniola the new nation of independent Haiti in early 1804. France continued to rule Spanish Santo Domingo. In 1805, Haitian troops of General Henri Christophe tried to conquer all of Hispaniola. They invaded Santo Domingo and sacked the towns of Santiago de los Caballeros and Moca, killing most of their residents, but news of a French fleet sailing towards Haiti forced General Christophe to return to Haiti, leaving the eastern Spanish side of the island in French hands. In 1808, following Napoleon's invasion of Spain, the criollos of Santo Domingo revolted against French rule and, with the aid of the United Kingdom (Spain's ally) returned Santo Domingo to Spanish control. Declaring that Hispaniola was indivisible, Haitians invaded Santo Domingo, which they occupied from 1822 to 1844.\\r\\nThe Dominicans successfully rose up and achieved independence in 1844. Haiti continued to loom as a threat, however, even after this expulsion. The Dominican army defeated the Haitians under Jean-Louis Pierrot at the battle of Estrelleta in September 1845 and at Beler, in November. Three years later, the Haitians invaded again under Faustin Soulouque. On March 21, 1849, Dominican soldiers were surprised and overwhelmed at Las Matas, the most western outpost. The defenders showed little will to fight. Almost no one resisted, but abandoned their guns and cannons.[26] San Juan fell almost without a shot.[26] This left only the town of Azua as the remaining Dominican stronghold between the Haitian army and the capital, Santo Domingo. The president of the Dominican Republic, Manuel Jimenes, found the soldiers demoralized. Insubordination was commonplace and went unpunished. The soldiers are not accustomed to obey, wrote the president.[26] On April 6, Azua fell and a Dominican counter-attack failed. But the Dominican government stubbornly clung to the idea that even this defeat was by no means decisive. The navy still commanded the southern harbors and could prevent the Haitians from being reinforced.[26]\\r\\nOn April 17, Dominican general Antonio Duverg led his forces to the first important Dominican victory at El N~mero.[26] Five days later, Dominican general Pedro Santana directed an attack upon the bulk of the enemy army at Las Carreras. The two-day battle began with a rain of cannon fire by the entrenched Haitians and ended with a Dominican assault followed by furious and brutal hand-to-hand combat.[26] No prisoners were taken by either side, and for a few hours Las Carreras became a veritable butcher shop.[26] The battle of Las Carreras dealt the invaders a crushing blow. Their armies became disorganized, and they were soon involved in a precipitous, mortifying retreat into Haiti.[26] The Minister of War, Ram܇n Bid܇, officially announced the victory and the end of Haitian threat in a tardy message on May 4: Dominicans, Providence protects us... The Haitians flee for their homes, attacked by hunger and destroyed by the lances and machetes of our brave Dominicans.[26]\\r\\nIn 1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire. Only six weeks into the new colonial era, rebellion began. On 2 May 1861, a Dominican general, Jos Contreras, and his followers rose up in arms. Spanish troops quickly suffocated the uprising and executed its leaders. Opponents of Dominican annexation, some of whom had been in exile for many years in St. Thomas and Cura?ao, also began to conspire against the Spanish government. In St. Thomas, Francisco del Rosario Snchez, one of the patriots of the Dominican war of independence (1844), organized the antiannexationist exiles. Soon after his forces invaded Dominican territory in June 1861, he was captured and shot.[27] Meanwhile, exiles in Cura?ao coalesced under Jos Mara Cabral to form the Revolutionary Party of Dominican Regeneration.[27] The Haitian government of Fabre Geffrard supported Cabral's war effort with supplies and allowed Dominican revolutionaries to cross the Haitian border at will.[27]\\r\\nBy 1862, the Spaniards were contending with a limited insurgency and losing hundreds of soldiers to guerrillas and the devastation of yellow fever.[28] A second wave of Dominican insurrectionary activity crested in mid-1863, this time in Santiago, in El Cibao. Increased taxes, arbitrary currency exchange policies, and an attempt to establish a state-run tobacco monopoly ignited a revolt among many of those who had risen against former president Buenaventura Bez in 1857 for similar reasons. Insurrection forces soon captured Santiago and set up a provisional government. Meanwhile, Cabral, a Baecista and therefore theoretically a rival of the Santiago bourgeoisie, joined the struggle against Spanish domination. This Dominican revolutionary coalition made considerable progress toward the overthrow of the colonial government. After August 1863, reports of rebel victories poured out of the island continually.[27] The mostly black and mulatto[29] insurgents burned and looted property and raped and murdered whites;[28] the Spanish shot or hung those they suspected of being or helping the rebels.[28] The Spanish abandoned the island, annulling the annexation in 1865.\\r\\nFearing the influence of a society that had successfully fought and won against their enslavers, the United States and European powers refused to recognize Haiti, the second republic in the western hemisphere. France demanded a high payment for compensation to slaveholders who lost their property, and Haiti was saddled with unmanageable debt for decades.[30] It became one of the poorest countries in the Americas, while the Dominican Republic[30] gradually has developed into the largest economy of Central America and the Caribbean.\\r\\nHispaniola is the second-largest island in the Caribbean (after Cuba), with an area of 76,192 square kilometers (29,418?sq?mi), 48,440 square kilometers (18,700?sq?mi)[31] of which is under the sovereignty of the Dominican Republic occupying the eastern portion and 27,750 square kilometers (10,710?sq?mi)[6] under the sovereignty of Haiti occupying the western portion.\\r\\nThe island of Cuba lies 80 kilometers (50?mi) to the northwest across the Windward Passage; 190 km to the southwest lies Jamaica, separated by the Jamaica Channel. Puerto Rico lies 130 km east of Hispaniola across the Mona Passage. The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands lie to the north. Its westernmost point is known as Cap Carcasse.\\r\\nCuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico are collectively known as the Greater Antilles.\\r\\nThe island has five major mountain ranges: The Central Range, known in the Dominican Republic as the Cordillera Central, spans the central part of the island, extending from the south coast of the Dominican Republic into northwestern Haiti, where it is known as the Massif du Nord. This mountain range boasts the highest peak in the Antilles, Pico Duarte at 3,098 meters (10,164?ft) above sea level. The Cordillera Septentrional runs parallel to the Central Range across the northern end of the Dominican Republic, extending into the Atlantic Ocean as the Saman Peninsula. The Cordillera Central and Cordillera Septentrional are separated by the lowlands of the Cibao Valley and the Atlantic coastal plains, which extend westward into Haiti as the Plaine du Nord (Northern Plain). The lowest of the ranges is the Cordillera Oriental, in the eastern part of the country.[32]\\r\\nThe Sierra de Neiba rises in the southwest of the Dominican Republic, and continues northwest into Haiti, parallel to the Cordillera Central, as the Montagnes Noires, Cha?ne des Matheux and the Montagnes du Trou d'Eau. The Plateau Central lies between the Massif du Nord and the Montagnes Noires, and the Plaine de lArtibonite lies between the Montagnes Noires and the Cha?ne des Matheux, opening westward toward the Gulf of Gonave, the largest gulf of the Antilles.[32]\\r\\nThe southern range begins in the southwestern most Dominican Republic as the Sierra de Bahoruco, and extends west into Haiti as the Massif de la Selle and the Massif de la Hotte, which form the mountainous spine of Haitis southern peninsula. Pic de la Selle is the highest peak in the southern range, the third highest peak in the Antilles and consequently the highest point in Haiti, at 2,680 meters (8,790?ft) above sea level. A depression runs parallel to the southern range, between the southern range and the Cha?ne des Matheux-Sierra de Neiba. It is known as the Plaine du Cul-de-Sac in Haiti, and Haitis capital Port-au-Prince lies at its western end. The depression is home to a chain of salt lakes, including Lake Azuei in Haiti and Lake Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic.[32]\\r\\nThe island has four distinct ecoregions. The Hispaniolan moist forests ecoregion covers approximately 50% of the island, especially the northern and eastern portions, predominantly in the lowlands but extending up to 2,100 meters (6,900?ft) elevation. The Hispaniolan dry forests ecoregion occupies approximately 20% of the island, lying in the rain shadow of the mountains in the southern and western portion of the island and in the Cibao valley in the center-north of the island. The Hispaniolan pine forests occupy the mountainous 15% of the island, above 850 metres (2,790?ft) elevation. The flooded grasslands and savannas ecoregion in the south central region of the island surrounds a chain of lakes and lagoons in which the most notable include that of Lake Azuei and Trou Ca?man in Haiti and the nearby Lake Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are many bird species in Hispaniola, and the island's amphibian species are also diverse.\\r\\nThe island has four distinct ecoregions.

Recent in-depth studies of satellite imagery and environmental analysis regarding forest classification conclude an accurate estimate of approximately 30% tree cover,[33] a stark decrease in the 60% forest cover in 1925. Despite recent in-depth studies, the notoriously unsubstantiated 2% forest cover estimate has been widely circulated in media and in discourse concerning the country.[34] Despite the drastic underestimation of Haiti's forest cover, the country has been significantly deforested over the last 50 years, resulting in the desertification of portions of the Haitian territory.\\r\\nIn the Dominican Republic the forest cover has increased. In 2003 the Dominican forest cover had been reduced to 32% of the territory, but in 2011 the trend towards reducing reverts to increase forest cover by eight percentage points to stand at nearly 40% of territory. The success of the Dominican forest growth is due to several Dominican government policies and private organizations for the purpose, and a strong educational campaign that has resulted in increased awareness on the Dominican people of the importance of forests for their welfare and in other forms of life on the island.[35]\\r\\nOwing to its mountainous topography, Hispaniolas climate shows considerable variation over short distances, and is the most varied of all the Antilles.[36]\\r\\nExcept in the Northern Hemisphere summer season, the predominant winds over Hispaniola are the northeast trade winds. As in Jamaica and Cuba, these winds deposit their moisture on the northern mountains, and create a distinct rain shadow on the southern coast, where some areas receive as little as 400 millimetres (16?in) of rainfall, and have semi-arid climates. Annual rainfall under 600 millimetres (24?in) also occurs on the southern coast of Haitis northwest peninsula and in the central Az~a region of the Plaine du Cul-de-Sac. In these regions, moreover, there is generally little rainfall outside hurricane season from August to October, and droughts are by no means uncommon when hurricanes do not come.[37]\\r\\nOn the northern coast, in contrast, rainfall may peak between December and February, though some rain falls in all months of the year. Annual amounts typically range from 1,700 to 2,000 millimetres (67 to 79?in) on the northern coastal lowlands;[36] there is probably much more in the Cordillera Septentrional, though no data exist.\\r\\nThe interior of Hispaniola, along with the southeastern coast centred around Santo Domingo, typically receives around 1,400 millimetres (55?in) per year, with a distinct wet season from May to October. Usually, this wet season has two peaks: one around May, the other around the hurricane season. In the interior highlands, rainfall is much greater, around 3,100 millimetres (120?in) per year, but with a similar pattern to that observed in the central lowlands.\\r\\nAs is usual for tropical islands, variations of temperature are much less marked than rainfall variations, and depend only on altitude. Lowland Hispaniola is generally oppressively hot and humid, with temperatures averaging 28?C (82?F). with high humidity during the daytime, and around 20?C (68?F) at night. At higher altitudes, temperatures fall steadily, so that frosts occur during the dry season on the highest peaks, where maxima are no higher than 18?C (64?F).\\r\\nThe Dominican Republic is a Hispanophone nation of approximately 10 million people. Spanish is spoken by all Dominicans as a primary language. Roman Catholicism is the official and dominant religion.\\r\\nHaiti is a Francophone nation of roughly 10 million people. Although French is spoken as a primary language by the educated and wealthy minority, virtually the entire population speaks Haitian Creole, one of several French-derived creole languages. Roman Catholicism is the dominant religion, practiced by more than half the population, although in some cases in combination with Haitian Vodou faith. Another 25% of the populace belong to Protestant churches.[38] Haiti emerged as the first Black republic[39] in the world.\\r\\nThe ethnic composition of the Dominican population is 73% mulatto,[40] 16% white and 11% black. Descendants of early Spanish settlers and of black slaves from West Africa constitute the two main racial strains.\\r\\nThe ethnic composition of Haiti is estimated to be 95% black, 5% white and mulatto.\\r\\nThe island has the largest economy in the Greater Antilles, however most of the economic development is found in the Dominican Republic, the Dominican economy being nearly 800% larger than the Haitian economy.\\r\\nThe estimated annual per capita income is US$1,300 in Haiti and US$8,200 in Dominican Republic.[41]\\r\\nThe divergence between the level of economic development between Haiti and Dominican Republic makes its border the higher contrast of all western land borders and is evident that the Dominican Republic has one of the highest migration issues in the Americas.[42]\\r\\nChristopher Columbus, noting \\"the land and trees resembled those of Spain, and that the sailors caught in their nets many fish like those of Spain...named it Espanola on Sunday, December 9th.\\" One of the first inhabitants he came across on this island was \\"a girl wearing only a gold nose plug.\\" Columbus later learned that the \\"land of gold was farther east.\\" Soon the Tainos were trading pieces of gold for hawk's bells with their cacique declaring the gold came from Cibao. Traveling further east from Navidad, Columbus came across the Yaque del Norte River, which he named Rio de Oro because its \\"sands abound in gold dust.\\"[43]\\r\\nOn Columbus' return during his second voyage he learned it was the cacique Caonabo, \\"lord of the mines\\", who had massacred his settlement at Navidad. While Columbus established a new settlement at La Isabela on Jan. 1494, he sent Alonso de Ojeda and 15 men to search for the \\"mines of Cibao.\\" After a six-day journey, Ojeda came across an area \\"very rich in gold\\", in which the \\"Indians took gold out of a brook...and many other streams in that province.\\" Columbus himself visited the mines of Cibao on 12 March 1494. He constructed the Fort of Santo Tomas, present day Janico, with Captain Pedro Margarit in command of 56 men.[43]:119,122ÿ126\\r\\nOn 24 March 1495, Columbus with his ally Guacanagarix, embarked on a war of revenge against Caonabo, capturing him and his family while \\"killing many Indians and capturing others.\\" Afterwards, \\"every person of fourteen years of age or upward was to pay a large hawk's bell of gold dust.\\"[43]:149ÿ150\\r\\nMiguel Diaz and Francisco de Garay discovered large gold nuggets on the lower Haina River in 1496. These San Cristobal mines were later known as the Minas Viejas mines. Then, in 1499, the first major discovery of gold was made in the cordillera central, which led to a mining boom. By 1501, Columbus' cousin Giovanni Colombo, had discovered gold near Buenaventura, the deposits were later known as Minas Nuevas. Two major mining areas resulted, one along San Cristobal-Buenaventura, and another in Cibao within the La Vega-Cotuy-Bonao triangle, while Santiago de los Caballeros, Concepcion, and Bonao became mining towns. The gold rush of 1500ÿ1508 ensued.[20]\\r\\nFerdinand \\"ordered gold from the richest mines reserved for the Crown.\\" Thus, Ovando expropriated the gold mines of Miguel Diaz and Francisco de Garay in 1504, as pit mines became royal mines, though placers were open to private prospectors. Furthermore, Ferdinand wanted the \\"best Indians\\" working his royal mines, and kept 967 in the San Cristobal mining area supervised by salaried miners.[20]:68,71,78,125ÿ127\\r\\nUnder Nicols de Ovando y Cceres' governorship, the Indians were made to work in the gold mines, \\"where they were grossly overworked, mistreated, and underfed,\\" according to Pons. By 1503, the Spanish Crown legalized the distribution of Indians to work the mines as part of the encomienda system. According to Pons, \\"Once the Indians entered the mines, hunger and disease literally wiped them out.\\" By 1508 the Indian population of about 400,000 was reduced to 60,000, and by 1514, only 26,334 remained. About half were located in the mining towns of Concepcion, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Buenaventura. The repartimiento of 1514 accelerated emigration of the Spanish colonists, coupled with the exhaustion of the mines. In 1516, a smallpox epidemic killed an additional 8,000, of the remaining 11,000 Indians, in one month. By 1519, according to Pons, \\"Both the gold economy and the Indian population became extinct at the same time.\\"[44][20]:191ÿ192\\r\\nHowever, writing in 1860, Courtney observed, the island is \\"one immense gold field\\", of which the early Spaniards had \\"scarcely began to be developed.\\" Additionally, \\"The gold is still found in the Cibao regions as of old.\\"[45] By 1919, Condit and Ross noted \\"the greater part of the Republic is covered by concessions granted by the government for mining minerals of diverse sorts.\\" Besides gold, these minerals included silver, manganese, copper, magnetite, iron and nickel.[46]\\r\\nMining operations in 2016 have taken advantage of the volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits (VMS) around Maim܇n. To the northeast, the Pueblo Viejo Gold Mine was operated by state-owned Rosario Dominicana from 1975 until 1991. In 2009, Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Corporation, formed by Barrick Gold and Goldcorp, started open-pit mining operations of the Monte Negro and Moore oxide deposits. The mined ore is processed with gold cyanidation. Pyrite and sphalerite are the main sulfide minerals found in the 120 m thick volcanic conglomerates and agglomerates, which constitute the world's second largest sulphidation gold deposit.[47]\\r\\nBetween Bonao and Maimon, Falconbridge Dominicana has been mining nickel laterites since 1971. The Cerro de Maimon copper/gold open-pit mine southeast of Maimon has been operated by Perilya since 2006. Copper is extracted from the sulfide ores, while gold and silver are extracted from both the sulfide and the oxide ores. Processing is via froth flotation and cyanidation. The ore is located in the VMS Early Cretaceous Maimon Formation. Goethite enriched with gold and silver is found in the 30 m thick oxide cap. Below that cap is a supergene zone containing pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite. Below the supergene zone is found the unaltered massive sulphide mineralization.[48]","input":"What two countries occupy the island of hispaniola?"},{"output":"counterweight trebuchets","context":"\\r\\nMedieval technology refers to the technology used in medieval Europe under Christian rule. After the Renaissance of the 12th century, medieval Europe saw a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth.[2] The period saw major technological advances, including the adoption of gunpowder, the invention of vertical windmills, spectacles, mechanical clocks, and greatly improved water mills, building techniques (Gothic architecture, medieval castles), and agriculture in general (three-field crop rotation).\\r\\nThe development of water mills from their ancient origins was impressive, and extended from agriculture to sawmills both for timber and stone. By the time of the Domesday Book, most large villages had turnable mills, around 6,500 in England alone.[3] Water-power was also widely used in mining for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering bellows.\\r\\nEuropean technical advancements from the 12th to 14th centuries were either built on long-established techniques in medieval Europe, originating from Roman and Byzantine antecedents, or adapted from cross-cultural exchanges through trading networks with the Islamic world, China, and India. Often, the revolutionary aspect lay not in the act of invention itself, but in its technological refinement and application to political and economic power. Though gunpowder along with other weapons had been started by Chinese, it was the Europeans who developed and perfected its military potential, precipitating European expansion and eventual imperialism in the Modern Era.\\r\\nAlso significant in this respect were advances in maritime technology. Advances in shipbuilding included the multi-masted ships with lateen sails, the sternpost-mounted rudder and the skeleton-first hull construction. Along with new navigational techniques such as the dry compass, the Jacob's staff and the astrolabe, these allowed economic and military control of the seas adjacent to Europe and enabled the global navigational achievements of the dawning Age of Exploration.\\r\\nAt the turn to the Renaissance, Gutenbergs invention of mechanical printing made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience. The technical drawings of late-medieval artist-engineers Guido da Vigevano and Villard de Honnecourt can be viewed as forerunners of later Renaissance works such as Taccola or da Vinci.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of some important medieval technologies. The approximate date or first mention of a technology in medieval Europe is given. Technologies were often a matter of cultural exchange and date and place of first inventions are not listed here (see main links for a more complete history of each).\\r\\nCarruca (6th to 9th centuries)\\r\\nA type of heavy wheeled plough commonly found in Northern Europe.[4] The device consisted of four major parts. The first part was a Coulter (agriculture) at the bottom of the plough.[5] This knife was used to vertically cut into the top sod to allow for the plowshare to work.[5] The plowshare was the second pair of knives which cut the sod horizontally, detaching it from the ground below.[5] The third part was the moldboard, which curled the sod outward.[5] The fourth part of the device was the team of eight oxen guided by the farmer.[6] This type of plough eliminated the need for cross-plowing by turning over the furrow instead of merely pushing it outward.[6] This type of wheeled plough made seed placement more consistent throughout the farm as the blade could be locked in at a certain level relative to the wheels.[7] A disadvantage to this type of plough was its maneuverability.[7] Since this equipment was large and lead by a small herd of oxen, turning the plough was difficult and time-consuming.[7] This caused many farmers to turn away from traditional square fields and adopt a longer, more rectangular field to ensure maximum efficiency.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nArd (plough) (5th century)\\r\\nAn early medieval plough that consisted of a sharpened wooden post pulled by either animals or humans.[8] This lightweight and primitive plough was used primarily before the invention of the carruca.[8] The ard was inefficient in more firm northern soil but did decent work in southern areas where the soil was much softer.[8] Although the ard required the user to apply constant pressure to the plough in order to make sure the edge could break the ground, the soil was merely pushed to the sides instead of being properly turned over.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nHorse collar (6th to 9th centuries)\\r\\nOnce oxen started to be replaced by horses on farms and in fields, the yoke became obsolete due to its shape not working well with a horses' posture.[9] The first design for a horse collar was a throat-and-girth-harness.[9] These types of harnesses were unreliable though due to them not being sufficiently set in place.[9] The loose straps were prone to slipping and shifting positions as the horse was working and often caused asphyxiation.[9] Around the eighth century, the introduction of the rigid collar eliminated the problem of choking.[9] The rigid collar was \\"placed over the horses head and rested on its shoulders.[9] This permitted unobstructed breathing and placed the weight of the plow or wagon where the horse could best support it.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nHorseshoes (9th century)\\r\\nAllowed horses to carry larger loads and move around with greater traction on hard to walk surfaces.[10] The practice of shoeing horses was initially practiced in the Roman Empire but lost popularity throughout the Middle Ages until around the 11th century.[10] Although horses in the southern lands could easily work while on the softer soil, the rocky soil of the north proved to be damaging to the horses' hooves.[11] Since the north was the problematic area, this is where shoeing horses first became popular.[11] The introduction of gravel roadways was also cause for the popularity of horseshoeing.[11] The loads a shoed horse could take on these roads were significantly higher than one that was barefoot.[11] By the 14th century, not only did horses have shoes, but many farmers were shoeing oxen and donkeys in order to help prolong the life of their hooves.[11] The size and weight of the horseshoe changed significantly over the course of the middle ages.[11] In the 10th century, horseshoes were secured by six nails and weighed around one-quarter of a pound, but throughout the years, the shoes grew larger and by the 14th century, the shoes were being secured with eight nails and weighed nearly half a pound.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nCrop rotation (8th century)\\r\\nAlso called the Two-field system. This system included the farmers' field being divided into two separate crops.[12] One field would grow a crop while the other was left to grow and was used to feed livestock and regain lost nutrients.[12] Every year, the two fields would switch in order to ensure fields did not become nutrient deficient.[12] In the 11th century, this system was introduced into Sweden and spread to become the most popular form of farming.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree-field system (8th century)\\r\\nThe ideal three-field system is one that separates a section of land into three equal parts.[13] Each one of the three parts holds a different crop.[13] One part holds a spring crop, such as barley or oats, another part holds a winter crop, such as wheat or rye, and the third part is an off-field that is left alone to grow and is used to help feed livestock.[13] By rotating the three crops to a new part of the land after each year, the off-field regains some of the nutrients lost during the growing of the two crops.[13] This system increases agricultural productivity over the Two-field system by only having one-third of the field not being used instead of one half.[13] Another advantage of crop rotation is that many scholars believe it helped increase yields by up to 50%.[13]\\r\\nWine press (12th century)\\r\\nThis device was the first practical means of Pressing (wine) on a plane surface.[14] The wine press was an expensive piece of machinery that only the wealthy could afford.[14] The method of Grape stomping was often used as a less expensive alternative.[14] While white wines required the use of a wine press in order to preserve the color of the wine by removing the juices quickly from the skin, red wine did not need to be pressed until the end of the juice removal process since the color did not matter.[14] Many red wine winemakers used their feet to smash the grapes then used a press to remove any juice that remained in the grape skins.[14]\\r\\nQanat (5th century)\\r\\nAn underground passage used to water fields, crops, and provide drinking water.[15] These tunnels had a gradual slope which used gravity to pull the water from either an aquifer or water well.[15] This system was originally found in middle eastern areas and is still used today in places where surface water is hard to find.\\r\\nArtesian well (1126)\\r\\nA thin rod with a hard iron cutting edge is placed in the bore hole and repeatedly struck with a hammer, underground water pressure forces the water up the hole without pumping. Artesian wells are named after the town of Artois in France, where the first one was drilled by Carthusian monks in 1126.\\r\\nCentral heating through underfloor channels (9th century)\\r\\nIn the early medieval Alpine upland, a simpler central heating system where heat travelled through underfloor channels from the furnace room replaced the Roman hypocaust at some places. In Reichenau Abbey a network of interconnected underfloor channels heated the 300 m2 large assembly room of the monks during the winter months. The degree of efficiency of the system has been calculated at 90%.[16]\\r\\nRib vault (12th century)\\r\\nAn essential element for the rise of Gothic architecture, rib vaults allowed vaults to be built for the first time over rectangles of unequal lengths. It also greatly facilitated scaffolding and largely replaced the older groin vault.\\r\\nChimney (12th century)\\r\\nThe earliest true chimneys appeared in Northern Europe during the 12th century, and with them came the first true fireplaces.\\r\\nSegmental arch bridge (1345)\\r\\nThe Ponte Vecchio in Florence is considered medieval Europe's first stone segmental arch bridge.\\r\\nTreadwheel crane (1220s)\\r\\nThe earliest reference to a treadwheel in archival literature is in France about 1225,[17] followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240.[18] Apart from tread-drums, windlasses and occasionally cranks were employed for powering cranes.[19]\\r\\nStationary harbour crane (1244)\\r\\nStationary harbour cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages; its earliest use being documented for Utrecht in 1244.[20] The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. There were two types: wooden gantry cranes pivoting on a central vertical axle and stone tower cranes which housed the windlass and treadwheels with only the jib arm and roof rotating.[1] These cranes were placed on docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like see-saws, winches and yards.[20] Slewing cranes which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.[21]\\r\\nFloating crane\\r\\nBeside the stationary cranes, floating cranes which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.[1]\\r\\nMast crane\\r\\nSome harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in Gdask, Cologne and Bremen.[1]\\r\\nWheelbarrow (1170s)\\r\\nThe wheelbarrow proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. Literary evidence for the use of wheelbarrows appeared between 1170 and 1250 in north-western Europe. The first depiction is in a drawing by Matthew Paris in the mid-13th century.\\r\\nOil paint (by 1125)\\r\\nAs early as the 13th century, oil was used to add details to tempera paintings and paint wooden statues. Flemish painter Jan van Eyck developed the use of a stable oil mixture for panel painting around 1410.[22]\\r\\nHourglass (1338)\\r\\nReasonably dependable, affordable and accurate measure of time. Unlike water in a clepsydra, the rate of flow of sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir, and the instrument is not liable to freeze. Hourglasses are a medieval innovation (first documented in Siena, Italy).\\r\\nMechanical clocks (13th to 14th centuries)\\r\\nA European innovation, these weight-driven clocks were used primarily in clock towers.\\r\\nCompound crank\\r\\nThe Italian physician Guido da Vigevano combines in his 1335 Texaurus, a collection of war machines intended for the recapture of the Holy Land, two simple cranks to form a compound crank for manually powering war carriages and paddle wheel boats. The devices were fitted directly to the vehicle's axle respectively to the shafts turning the paddle wheels.[23]\\r\\nBlast furnace (1150ÿ1350)\\r\\nEuropean cast iron first appears in Middle Europe (for instance Lapphyttan in Sweden, Drstel in Switzerland and the M?rkische Sauerland in Germany) around 1150,[24] in some places according to recent research even before 1100.[25] The technique is considered to be an independent European development.[26]\\r\\nPaper mill (13th century)\\r\\nThe first certain use of a water-powered paper mill, evidence for which is elusive in both Chinese[27][28] and Muslim paper making,[29] dates to 1282.[30]\\r\\nRolling mill (15th century)\\r\\nUsed to produce metal sheet of an even thickness. First used on soft, malleable metals, such as lead, gold and tin. Leonardo da Vinci described a rolling mill for wrought iron.\\r\\nTidal Mills (6th century)\\r\\nThe earliest tidal mills were excavated on the Irish coast where watermillers knew and employed the two main waterwheel types: a 6th-century tide mill at Killoteran near Waterford was powered by a vertical waterwheel,[31] while the tide changes at Little Island were exploited by a twin-flume horizontal-wheeled mill (c. 630) and a vertical undershot waterwheel alongside it.[32][33] Another early example is the Nendrum Monastery mill from 787 which is estimated to have developed seven to eight horsepower at its peak.[34][35]\\r\\nVertical windmills (1180s)\\r\\nInvented in Europe as the pivotable post mill, the first surviving mention of one comes from Yorkshire in England in 1185. They were efficient at grinding grain or draining water. Stationary tower mills were also developed in the 13th century.\\r\\nWater hammer (12th century at the latest)\\r\\nUsed in metallurgy to forge the metal blooms from bloomeries and Catalan forges, they replaced manual hammerwork. The water hammer was eventually superseded by steam hammers in the 19th century.\\r\\nDry compass (12th century)\\r\\nThe first European mention of the directional compass is in Alexander Neckam's On the Natures of Things, written in Paris around 1190.[36] It was either transmitted from China or the Arabs or an independent European innovation. Dry compass were invented in the Mediterranean around 1300.[37]\\r\\nAstronomical compass (1269)\\r\\nThe French scholar Pierre de Maricourt describes in his experimental study Epistola de magnete (1269) three different compass designs he has devised for the purpose of astronomical observation.[38]\\r\\nStern-mounted rudders (1180s)\\r\\nThe first depiction of a pintle-and-gudgeon rudder on church carvings dates to around 1180. They first appeared with cogs in the North and Baltic Seas and quickly spread to Mediterranean. The iron hinge system was the first stern rudder permanently attached to the ship hull and made a vital contribution to the navigation achievements of the age of discovery and thereafter.[39]\\r\\nMovable type printing press (1440s)\\r\\nJohannes Gutenberg's great innovation was not the printing itself, but instead of using carved plates as in woodblock printing, he used separate letters (types) from which the printing plates for pages were made up. This meant the types were recyclable and a page cast could be made up far faster.\\r\\nPaper (13th century)\\r\\nPaper was invented in China and transmitted through Islamic Spain in the 13th century. In Europe, the paper-making processes was mechanized by water-powered mills and paper presses (see paper mill).\\r\\nRotating bookmark (13th century)\\r\\nA rotating disc and string device used to mark the page, column, and precise level in the text where a person left off reading in a text. Materials used were often leather, velum, or paper.\\r\\nSpectacles (1280s)\\r\\nThe first spectacles, invented in Florence, used convex lenses which were of help only to the far-sighted. Concave lenses were not developed prior to the 15th century.\\r\\nWatermark (1282)\\r\\nThis medieval innovation was used to mark paper products and to discourage counterfeiting. It was first introduced in Bologna, Italy.\\r\\nArabic Numerals (13th century)\\r\\nThe first recorded mention in Europe was in 976, and they were first widely published in 1202 by Fibonacci with his Liber Abaci.\\r\\nUniversity\\r\\nThe first medieval universities were founded between the 11th and 13th centuries leading to a rise in literacy and learning. By 1500, the institution had spread throughout most of Europe and played a key role in the Scientific Revolution. Today, the educational concept and institution has been globally adopted.[40]\\r\\nFunctional button (13th century)\\r\\nGerman buttons appeared in 13th-century Germany as an indigenous innovation.[41] They soon became widespread with the rise of snug-fitting clothing.\\r\\nHorizontal loom (11th century)\\r\\nHorizontal looms operated by foot-treadles were faster and more efficient.\\r\\nSilk (6th century)\\r\\nManufacture of silk began in Eastern Europe in the 6th century and in Western Europe in the 11th or 12th century. Silk had been imported over the Silk Road since antiquity. The technology of \\"silk throwing\\" was mastered in Tuscany in the 13th century. The silk works used waterpower and some regard these as the first mechanized textile mills.\\r\\nSpinning wheel (13th century)\\r\\nBrought to Europe probably from India.\\r\\nChess (1450)\\r\\nThe earliest predecessors of the game originated in 6th-century AD India and spread via Persia and the Muslim world to Europe. Here the game evolved into its current form in the 15th century.\\r\\nForest glass (c. 1000)\\r\\nThis type of glass uses wood ash and sand as the main raw materials and is characterised by a variety of greenish-yellow colours.\\r\\nGrindstones (834)\\r\\nGrindstones are a rough stone, usually sandstone, used to sharpen iron. The first rotary grindstone (turned with a leveraged handle) occurs in the Utrecht Psalter, illustrated between 816 and 834.[42] According to H?germann, the pen drawing is a copy of a late-antique manuscript.[43] A second crank which was mounted on the other end of the axle is depicted in the Luttrell Psalter from around 1340.[44]\\r\\nLiquor (12th century)\\r\\nAlcohol distillation was introduced by Pr Sin? (Persian ??? ???? or ??? ???? ???? or ??? ???? Pur-e Sina; [?pu?r ?si?n?] \\"son of Sina\\";[full citation needed] August c. 980 ÿ June 1037), commonly known as Ibn Sؐn, or in Arabic writing Ab ?Alؐ al-?usayn ibn ?Abd Allh ibn Al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Sؐn. It was initially used as a medicinal elixir and was a popular remedy for the Black Death during the 14th century. Drinks such as vodka, gin and brandy come into form.\\r\\nMagnets (12th century)\\r\\nMagnets were first referenced in the Roman d'Enas, composed between 1155 and 1160.\\r\\nMirrors (1180)\\r\\nThe first mention of a \\"glass\\" mirror is in 1180 by Alexander Neckham who said \\"Take away the lead which is behind the glass and there will be no image of the one looking in.\\"\\r\\nIllustrated surgical atlas (1345)\\r\\nGuido da Vigevano (c. 1280 ? 1349) was the first author to add illustrations to his anatomical descriptions. His Anathomia provides pictures of neuroanatomical structures and techniques such as the dissection of the head by means of trephination, and depictions of the meninges, cerebrum, and spinal cord.[45]\\r\\nQuarantine (1377)\\r\\nInitially a 40-day-period, the quarantine was introduced by the Republic of Ragusa as a measure of disease prevention related to the Black Death. It was later adopted by Venice from where the practice spread all around in Europe.\\r\\nRat traps (1170s)\\r\\nThe first mention of a rat trap is in the medieval romance Yvain, the Knight of the Lion by Chrtien de Troyes.\\r\\nSoap (9th century)\\r\\nSoap came into widespread European use in the 9th century in semi-liquid form, with hard soap perfected by the Arabs in the 12th century.\\r\\nQuilted Armour (pre 5th - 14th Century)\\r\\nThere was a vast amount of armour technology available through the 5th to 16th centuries. Most soldiers during this time wore padded or quilted armor. This was the cheapest and most available armor for the majority of soldiers. Quilted armour was usually just a jacket made of thick linen and wool meant to pad or soften the impact of blunt weapons and light blows. Although, this technology predated the 5th century, it was still extremely prevalent because of the low cost and the weapon technology at the time made the bronze armor of the Greeks and Romans obsolete. Quilted armour was also used in conjunction with other types of armour. Usually worn over or under leather, mail, and later plate armour.[46]\\r\\nCuir Bouilli (5th-10th Century)\\r\\nHardened leather armour also called Cuir Bouilli was a step up from quilted armour. Made by boiling leather in either water, wax or oil to soften it so it can be shaped, it would then be allowed to dry and become very hard.[47] Large pieces of armour could be made such as breast plates, helmets, and leg guards, but many times smaller pieces would be sewn into the quilting of quilted armour or strips would be sewn together on the outside of a linen jacket. This was not as affordable as the quilted armour but offered much better protection against edged slashing weapons.\\r\\nChain Mail (11th-16th Century)\\r\\nThe most common type during the 11th through the 16th centuries was the Hauberk, also known earlier than the 11th century as the Carolingian byrnie.[48] Made of interlinked rings of metal, it sometimes consisted of a coif that covered the head and a tunic that covered the torso, arms, and legs down to the knees. Chain mail was very effective at protecting against light slashing blows but ineffective against stabbing or thrusting blows. The great advantage was that it allowed a great freedom of movement and was relatively light with significant protection over quilted or hardened leather armour. It was far more expensive than the hardened leather or quilted armour because of the massive amount of labor it required to create. This made it unattainable for most soldiers and only the more wealthy soldiers could afford it. Later, toward the end of the 13th century banded mail became popular.[49] Constructed of washer shaped rings of iron overlapped and woven together by straps of leather as opposed to the interlinked metal rings of chain mail, banded mail was much more affordable to manufacture. The washers were so tightly woven together that it was very difficult penetrate and offered greater protection from arrow and bolt attacks.[50]\\r\\nJazerant (11th century)\\r\\nThe Jazerant or Jazeraint was an adaptation of chain mail in which the chain mail would be sewn in between layers of linen or quilted armour.[51] Exceptional protection against light slashing weapons and slightly improved protection against small thrusting weapons, but little protection against large blunt weapons such as maces and axes. This gave birth to reinforced chain mail and became more prevalent in the 12th and 13th century. Reinforced armour was made up of chain mail with metal plates or hardened leather plates sewn in. This greatly improved protection from stabbing and thrusting blows.\\r\\nScale Armour (12th century)\\r\\nA type of Lamellar armour,[52] was made up entirely of small, overlapping plates. Either sewn together, usually with leather straps, or attached to a backing such as linen, or a quilted armor. Scale armour does not require the labor to produce that chain mail does and therefore is more affordable. It also affords much better protection against thrusting blows and pointed weapons. Though, it is much heavier, more restrictive and impedes free movement.\\r\\nPlate Armour (14th century)\\r\\nPlate armour covered the entire body. Although parts of the body were already covered in plate armour as early as 1250, such as the Poleyns for covering the knees and Couters - plates that protected the elbows,[53] the first complete full suit without any textiles was seen around 1410-1430. [54] Components of medieval armour that made up a full suit consisted of a cuirass, a gorget, vambraces, gauntlets, cuisses, greaves, and sabatons held together by internal leather straps. Improved weaponry such as crossbows and the long bow had greatly increased range and power. This made penetration of the chain mail hauberk much easier and more common.[55] By the mid 1400's most plate was worn alone and without the need of a hauberk.[56] Advances in metal working such as the blast furnace and new techniques for carburizing made plate armour nearly impenetrable and the best armour protection available at the time. Although plate armour was fairly heavy, because each suit was custom tailored to the wearer, it was very easy to move around in. A full suit of plate armour was extremely expensive and mostly unattainable for the majority of soldiers. Only very wealthy land owners and nobility could afford it. The quality of plate armour increases as more armour makers became more proficient in metal working. A suit of plate armour became a symbol of social status and the best made were personalized with embellishments and engravings. Plate armour saw continued use in battle until the 17th century.\\r\\nArched saddle (11th century)\\r\\nThe arched saddle enabled mounted knights to wield lances underarm and prevent the charge from turning into an unintentional pole-vault. This innovation gave birth to true shock cavalry, enabling fighters to charge on full gallop.\\r\\nSpurs (11th century)\\r\\nSpurs were invented by the Normans and appeared at the same time as the cantled saddle. They enabled the horseman to control his horse with his feet, replacing the whip and leaving his arms free. Rowel spurs familiar from cowboy films were already known in the 13th century. Gilded spurs were the ultimate symbol of the knighthood - even today someone is said to \\"earn his spurs\\" by proving his or her worthiness.\\r\\nStirrup (6th century)\\r\\nStirrups were invented by steppe nomads in what is today Mongolia and northern China in the 4th century. They were introduced in Byzantium in the 6th century and in the Carolingian Empire in the 8th. They allowed a mounted knight to wield a sword and strike from a distance leading to a great advantage for mounted cavalry.\\r\\nCannon (1324)\\r\\nCannons are first recorded in Europe at the siege of Metz in 1324. In 1350 Petrarch wrote \\"these instruments which discharge balls of metal with most tremendous noise and flashes of fire...were a few years ago very rare and were viewed with greatest astonishment and admiration, but now they are become as common and familiar as any other kinds of arms.\\"[1]\\r\\nVolley gun\\r\\nSee Ribauldequin.\\r\\nCorned gunpowder (late 14th century)\\r\\nFirst practiced in Western Europe, corning the black powder allowed for more powerful and faster ignition of cannons. It also facilitated the storage and transportation of black powder. Corning constituted a crucial step in the evolution of gunpowder warfare.\\r\\nSupergun (late 14th century)\\r\\nExtant examples include the wrought-iron Pumhart von Steyr, Dulle Griet and Mons Meg as well as the cast-bronze Faule Mette and Faule Grete (all from the 15th century).\\r\\nCounterweight trebuchet (12th century)\\r\\nPowered solely by the force of gravity, these catapults revolutionized medieval siege warfare and construction of fortifications by hurling huge stones unprecedented distances. Originating somewhere in the eastern Mediterranean basin, counterweight trebuchets were introduced in the Crusader states by the 1120s, Byzantium by the 1130s and in the Latin West by the second half of the century.[57]\\r\\nLongbow with massed, disciplined archery (13th century)\\r\\nHaving a high rate of fire and penetration power, the longbow contributed to the eventual demise of the medieval knight class[dubious ÿ discuss]. Used particularly by the English to great effect against the French cavalry during the Hundred Years' War (1337ÿ1453).\\r\\nSteel crossbow (late 14th century)\\r\\nEuropean innovation. Came with several different cocking aids to enhance draw power, making the weapons also the first hand-held mechanical crossbows.\\r\\nCombined arms tactics (14th century)\\r\\nThe battle of Halidon Hill 1333 was the first battle where intentional and disciplined combined arms infantry tactics were employed.[dubious ÿ discuss] The English men-at-arms dismounted aside the archers, combining thus the staying power of super-heavy infantry and striking power of their two-handed weapons with the missiles and mobility of the archers using longbows and shortbows . Combining dismounted knights and men-at-arms with archers was the archetypal Western Medieval battle tactics until the battle of Flodden 1513 and final emergence of firearms.\\r\\nLongbowmen (c. 1493)\\r\\nCranked rack-and-pinion device for cocking a crossbow (c. 1493)\\r\\nOrgan gun in the Bellifortis (c. 1405)","input":"What was one of the weapon technologies that emerged during the crusades?"},{"output":"after 1325","context":"The Templo Mayor (Spanish for \\"Main Temple\\") was one of the main temples of the Aztecs in their capital city of Tenochtitlan, which is now Mexico City. Its architectural style belongs to the late Postclassic period of Mesoamerica. The temple was called the Huyi Tecalli [we:?i teo??kali][1] in the Nahuatl language and dedicated simultaneously to two gods, Huitzilopochtli, god of war, and Tlaloc, god of rain and agriculture, each of which had a shrine at the top of the pyramid with separate staircases. The spire in the center of the adjacent image was devoted to Quetzalcoatl in his form as the wind god, Ehecatl.[2] The Great Temple devoted to Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc, measuring approximately 100 by 80?m (328 by 262?ft) at its base, dominated the Sacred Precinct.[3] Construction of the first temple began sometime after 1325, and it was rebuilt six times. The temple was destroyed by the Spanish in 1521 to make way for the new cathedral.[4] Today, the archeological site lies just to the northeast of the Zocalo, or main plaza of Mexico City, in the block between Seminario and Justo Sierra streets.[5]\\r\\nThe site is part of the Historic Center of Mexico City, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the destruction of Tenochtitlan, the Templo Mayor, like most of the rest of the city, was taken apart and covered over by the new Spanish colonial city. The Temples exact location was forgotten, although by the 20th-century scholars had a good idea where to look for it.[6] This was based on the archeological work done at the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. Leopoldo Batres did some excavation work at the end of the 19th century under the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral because at this time, the temple was thought to be there.[4] In the first decades of the 20th century, Manuel Gamio found part of the southwest corner of the temple and his finds were put on public display. However, it did not generate great public interest in excavating further because the zone was an upper-class residential area.[5] In 1933, Emilio Cuevas found part of a staircase and beam. In 1948, Hugo Moedano and Elma Estrada Balmori excavated a platform containing serpent heads and offerings. In 1966, Eduardo Contreras and Jorge Angula excavated a chest containing offerings that was first explored by Gamio.[4]\\r\\nThe push to fully excavate the site did not come until late in the 20th century. On 21 February 1978, workers for the electric company were digging at a place in the city then popularly known as the \\"island of the dogs\\". It was so named because it was slightly elevated over the rest of the neighborhood, and when that was flooded, street dogs would congregate there. Just over two meters down, the diggers struck a pre-Hispanic monolith. This stone turned out to be a huge disk of over 3.25 meters (10.7 feet) in diameter, 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) thick and weighing 8.5 metric tons (8.4 long tons; 9.4 short tons). The relief on the stone was later determined to be Coyolxauhqui, Huitzilopochtli's sister, dating to the end of the 15th century.[5]\\r\\nFrom 1978 to 1982, specialists directed by archeologist Eduardo Matos Moctezuma worked on the project to excavate the Temple.[5] Initial excavations found that many of the artifacts were in good enough condition to study.[7] Efforts coalesced into the Templo Mayor Project, which was authorized by presidential decree.[8]\\r\\nTo excavate, 13 buildings in this area had to be demolished. Nine of these were built in the 1930s and four dated from the 19th century, and had preserved colonial elements. During excavations, more than 7,000 objects were found, mostly offerings including effigies, clay pots in the image of Tlaloc, skeletons of turtles, frogs, crocodiles, and fish, snail shells, coral, some gold, alabaster, Mixtec figurines, ceramic urns from Veracruz, masks from what is now Guerrero state, copper rattles, decorated skulls and knives of obsidian and flint. These objects are housed in the Templo Mayor Museum.[5] This museum is the result of the work done since the early 1980s to rescue, preserve and research the Templo Mayor, its Sacred Precinct and all objects associated with it. The museum exists to make all of the finds available to the public.[8]\\r\\nThe excavated site consists of two parts: the temple itself, exposed and labeled to show its various stages of development, along with some other associated buildings, and the museum, built to house the smaller and more fragile objects.[8]\\r\\nMexican pyramids were typically expanded by building over prior ones, using the bulk of the former as a base for the latter, as later rulers sought to expand the temple to reflect the growing greatness of the city of Tenochtitlan. Therefore, digging down through this pyramid takes us back in time. The first temple was begun by the Aztecs the year after they founded the city, and the pyramid was rebuilt six times. All seven stages of the Templo Mayor, except the first, have been excavated and assigned to the reigns of the emperors who were responsible for them.[9]\\r\\nConstruction of the first Templo Mayor began sometime after 1325. This first pyramid is only known through historical records, because the high water table of the old lakebed prevents excavation.[9] According to these records, the first pyramid was built with earth and perishable wood, which may not have survived to the present time.[5][6][10]\\r\\nThe second temple was built during the reigns of Acamapichtli, Huitzilihuitl and Chimalpopoca between 1375 and 1427. The upper part of this temple has been excavated, exposing two stone shrines covered in stucco on the north side. A chacmool was uncovered as well. On the south side, there is a sacrificial stone called a \\"tchcatl\\" and a sculpted face.[4][5][6]\\r\\nThe third temple was built between 1427 and 1440 during the reign of Itzcoatl. A staircase with eight stone standard-bearers is from this stage bearing the glyph with the year Four-Reed (1431) These standard bearers act as \\"divine warriors\\" guarding the access to the upper shrines.[5][6]\\r\\nThe fourth temple was constructed between 1440 and 1481 during the reigns of Moctezuma I and Axayacatl. This stage is considered to have the richest of the architectural decorations as well as sculptures. Most offerings from the excavations are from this time. The great platform was decorated with serpents and braziers, some of which are in the form of monkeys and some in the form of Tlaloc. At this time, the stairway to the shrine of Tlaloc was defined by a pair of undulating serpents and in the middle of this shrine was a small altar defined by a pair of sculpted frogs. The circular monolith of Coyolxauhqui also dates from this time.[5][6]\\r\\nThe fifth temple (1481ÿ1486) is dated during the short reign of Tizoc. During these five years, the platform was recovered in stucco and the ceremonial plaza was paved.[5]\\r\\nThe sixth temple was built during the reign of Ahuizotl. He finished some of the updates made by Tizoc and made his own; as shown on the carvings of the \\"commemoration stone of the huei teocalli\\", showing the two tlatoqueh celebrating the opening of the temple during the last day of the month Panquetzaliztli dedicated to Huitzilopochtli; day 7 acatl of the year 8 acatl (Dec 19th, 1487). The Sacred Precinct was walled off and this wall was decorated with serpent heads. He built three shrines and the House of the Eagle Warriors.[5]\\r\\nThe seventh and last temple is what Hernn Corts and his men saw when they arrived to Tenochtitlan in 1519. Very little of this layer remains because of the destruction the Spaniards wrought when they conquered the city. Only a platform to the north and a section of paving in the courtyard on the south side can still be seen.[5]\\r\\nMost of what is known about this temple is based on the historical record. It was at the time the largest and most important active ceremonial center. Fray Bernardino de Sahag~n reported that the Sacred Precinct had 78 buildings; the Templo Mayor towered above all of them.[10]\\r\\nThe pyramid was composed of four sloped terraces with a passage between each level, topped by a great platform that measured approximately 80 by 100 meters (262 by 328 feet). It had two stairways to access the two shrines on the top platform. One was dedicated to Tlaloc, the god of water on the left side (as you face the structure), and one to Huitzilopochtli, deity of war and of the sun, on the right side. The two temples were approximately 60 meters (200 feet) in height, and each had large braziers where the sacred fires continuously burned. The entrance of each temple had statues of robust and seated men which supported the standard-bearers and banners of handmade bark paper. Each stairway was defined by balustrades flanking the stairs terminating in menacing serpent heads at the base. These stairways were used only by the priests and sacrificial victims. The entire building was originally covered with stucco and polychrome paint.[5][6][11]\\r\\nThe deities were housed inside the temple, shielded from the outside by curtains. The idol of Huitzilopochtli was modeled from amaranth seeds held together with honey and human blood. Inside of him were bags containing jade, bones and amulets to give life to the god. This figure was constructed annually and it was richly dressed and fitted with a mask of gold for his festival held during the Aztec month of Panquetzaliztli. At the end of the festival, the image was broken apart and shared among the populace to be eaten.[6]\\r\\nIn his description of the city, Corts records that he and the other Spaniards were impressed by the number and magnificence of the temples constructed in Tenochtitlan, but that was tempered by this disdain for their beliefs and human sacrifice.[7]\\r\\nOn 14 November 1519, Cortes seized the emperor Moctezuma II and ordered the destruction of all the religious relics of the Aztecs. He ordered a Catholic cross placed on the Templo Mayor.[12] While Cortes left for Veracruz to confront Spaniards looking to arrest him, Pedro de Alvarado learned of a plan to attack the Spaniards, and staged a pre-emptive attack on the Aztecs in the Sacred Precinct while they celebrated a religious festival. Unarmed and trapped within the walls of the Sacred Precinct, an estimated 8,000ÿ10,000 Aztec nobles were killed. When word of the massacre spread throughout the city, the people turned on the Spaniards, killing seven, wounding many, and driving the rest back to their quarters. The Spaniards were trapped between two Aztec forces and 68 were captured alive. Ten of these Spanish captives were immediately sacrificed at the Temple and their severed heads were thrown back to the Spaniards. The others were sacrificed at the Great Temple that night, which could be seen from the Spanish camps. The sacrificed Spaniards were flayed and their faces  with beards attached  were tanned and sent to allied towns, both to solicit assistance and to warn against betraying the alliance.[13]\\r\\nAfter the fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521, the lands controlled by the Aztecs became part of the Spanish empire. All the temples, including the Templo Mayor, were sacked, taking all objects of gold and other precious materials.[4] Corts, who had ordered the destruction of the existing capital, had a Mediterranean-style city built on the site. Essential elements of the old imperial center, including the Templo Mayor, were buried under similarly key features of the new Spanish city in what is now the historical downtown of the Mexico City.[7] The Templo Mayor and Sacred Precinct were demolished and a Spanish church, later the main cathedral, was built on the western half of the precinct.[4]\\r\\nAccording to tradition, the Templo Mayor is located on the exact spot where the god Huitzilopochtli gave the Mexica people his sign that they had reached the promised land: an eagle on a nopal cactus with a snake in its mouth.[6]\\r\\nThe Templo Mayor was partially a symbolic representation of the Hill of Coatepec, where according to Mexica myth, Huitzilopochtli was born.[11] Huitzilopochtli emerged from his mother Coatlicue fully grown and fully armed to battle his sister Coyolxauhqui and her brothers the Centzon Huitznahua who intended to kill him and their mother. Huitzilopochtli was victorious, slaying and dismembering his sister. Her body was then thrown to the bottom of the hill. As the southern half of the Great Temple represented Coatepec (on the side dedicated to Huitzilopochtli), the great stone disk with Coyolxauhquis dismembered body was found at the foot of this side of the temple. The northern half represented Tonacatepetl, the mountain home of Tlaloc.[9][14]\\r\\nThe sacred ballcourt and skull rack were located at the foot of the stairs of the twin temples, to mimic, like the stone disk, where Huitzilopochtli was said to have placed the goddess severed head. These locations served as a place for the reenactment of the mythical conflict.[14]\\r\\nThe various levels of the Temple also represent the cosmology of the Aztec world. First of all, it is aligned with the cardinal directions with gates that connect to roads leading in these directions.[9][14] This indicates the place where the plane of the world that humans live in intersects the thirteen levels of the heavens, called Topan and the nine levels of the underworld, called Mictlan.[9]\\r\\nArchaeologist Eduardo Matos Moctezuma, in his essay \\"Symbolism of the Templo Mayor,\\" posits that the orientation of the temple is indicative of the total vision that the Mexica had of the universe (cosmovision). He states that the \\"principal center, or navel, where the horizontal and vertical planes intersect, that is, the point from which the heavenly or upper plane and the plane of the Underworld begin and the four directions of the universe originate, is the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan.\\"[15] Matos Moctezuma supports his supposition by claiming that the temple acts as an embodiment of a living myth where \\"all sacred power is concentrated and where all the levels intersect.\\" Said myth is the birth and struggle between Huitzilopochtli and Coyolxauhqui.\\r\\nThe Sacred Precinct of the Templo Mayor encompassed an area of almost 4,000 square meters (43,000 square feet) and it was surrounded by a wall called the \\"coatepantli\\" (serpent wall). Among the most important buildings were the ballcourt, the Calmecac (area for priests), and the temples dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, Tezcatlipoca and the sun.[16] The Templo Mayor itself delineated the eastern side of the Sacred Precinct.[4]\\r\\nOn the sides of the Templo Mayor, archeologists have excavated a number of palatial rooms and conjoining structures. One of the best preserved and most important is the Palace (or House) of the Eagle Warriors. This area dates back to the fourth stage of the temple, around 1469. It was excavated in 1981 and 1982 by Jos Francisco Hinojosa. It is a large L-shaped room with staircases decorated with sculptures of eagle heads. To enter this main room, one had to pass through an entrance guarded by two large sculpted representations of these warriors. The Eagle Warriors were a privileged class who were dedicated to the god Huitzilopochtli, and dressed to look like eagles. Adjoining this palace is the temple for these warriorsalso known as the Red Temple. This temple shows clear Teotihuacan influence in its paintings (mostly in red) and the design of its altar. Almost all the interior walls of the House of the Eagles are decorated with beautiful paintings and contain long benches, which are also painted. These benches are composed of two panels. The upper one is a frieze with undulating serpents in bas-relief. The lower panel shows processions of armed warriors converging on a zacatapayolli, a grass ball into which the Mexica stuck bloody lancets during the ritual of autosacrifice. This palace specifically imitates much of the style of the Burnt Palace, located in the ruins of Tula.[17] A number of important artifacts have been found in this area, the most important of which are two nearly identical large ceramic sculptures of Mictlantecuhtl, the god of death. Despite being found in fragile pieces, they were both reconstructed and are on display at the on-site museum.[18][19][20]\\r\\nAnother conjoining area was dedicated to the Ocelot Warriors. Their temple, dedicated to the god Tezcatlipoca, lies under the current Museo de la Secretara de Hacienda y Crdito P~blico to the south of the Templo Mayor.[3][4]\\r\\nThe Calmecac was a residence hall for priests and a school for future priests, administrators and politicians, where they studied theology, literature, history and astronomy. Its exact location is on one side of what is now Donceles Street. The Temple of Quetzalcoatl was located to the west of the Templo Mayor. It is said that during the equinox, the sun rose between the shrines dedicated to Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc and shone directly on this temple. Due to the gods serpentine nature, the temple had a circular base instead of a rectangular one.[3]\\r\\nThe ball field, called the tlachtli or teutlachtli, was similar to many sacred ball fields in Mesoamerica. Games were played barefoot, and players used their hips to move a heavy ball to stone rings. The field was located west of the Templo Mayor, near the twin staircases and oriented east-west. Next to this ball field was the \\"huey tzompanti\\" where the skulls of sacrifice victims were kept after being covered in stucco and decorated.[3]\\r\\nThe Temple of the Sun was located west of the Templo Mayor also and its remains lie under the Metropolitan Cathedral. The project to shore up the cathedral at the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st brought to light a number of artifacts.[3]\\r\\nMost of the objects found in the Templo Mayor were offerings. Although many are of Mexica design, there are also abundant items from other peoples, brought in as tribute or through trade. Sculptures, flint knives, vessels, beads and other sumptuary ornamentsas well as minerals, plants and animals of all types, and the remains of human sacrificewere among the items deposited in offerings. All of these fulfilled a specific function within the offering, depending on the symbolism of each object. In excavations at the Templo Mayor, different types of offerings have been found and have been grouped by researchers in terms of Time (the period in which the offering was deposited); Space (the location of the offering within the structure); Container (type and dimensions of the receptacle containing the objects); internal distribution (placement of objects within the offering) and value of the items. The offerings were usually contained in cavities, in stone urns, and in boxes made of slabs. These are found under floors; in platforms, architectural bodies, stairways and in temples. These offerings were placed accompanied by complex rituals following set temporal, spatial and symbolic patterns, depending on the intention of the offering.[21]\\r\\nThe oldest Mexica objects, located in the second temple, are two urns which contain the remains of incinerated bones; one of the urns was made of obsidian and the other of alabaster. A small silver mask and a gold bell were found inside one urn, and second gold bell and two green stone beads were placed in the other.[21]\\r\\nImages of the gods Huehueteotl-Xiuhtecuhtli, together with Tlaloc, presided over most of the offerings found in the Templo Mayor. Representing fire and water respectively, this pair of deities probably symbolized the concept of \\"burning water,\\" a metaphor for warfare.[21]\\r\\nAnother theme exhibited in this hall is autosacrifice, a ritual that was conducted in private as a personal act of communication with the gods. Widespread throughout the entire population, this practice was performed by perforating certain fleshy parts of the bodysuch as the earlobes, lips, tongue, chest, calves, et ceterawith obsidian blades, agave needles or bone perforators. Once the implement was covered with blood, it was inserted in straw balls called Zacatapayoli. The entirety was probably placed in ceremonial boxestepetlacallias an offering to the gods. Objects associated with human sacrifice are the \\"face blades\\" or knives decorated with eyes and teeth, as well as skull masks. Other ceremonial items include musical instruments, jewelry, and braziers for the burning of copal.[21]\\r\\nThe museum of the Templo Mayor was built in 1987 to house the Templo Mayor Project and its findsa project which continues work to this day. In 1991, the Urban Archeology Program was incorporated as part of the Templo Mayor Project whose mission is to excavate the oldest area of the city, around the main plaza.[4] The museum building was built by architect Pedro Ramrez Vzquez, who envisioned a discreet structure that would blend in with the colonial surroundings. The museum has four floors, three of which are for permanent exhibitions and the fourth houses offices for the director, museum administration and research staff. Other departments are located in the basement, where there is also an auditorium.[22]\\r\\nThe museum has eight main exhibition halls, called \\"salas\\", each dedicated to a different theme. Room 1 is dedicated to the goddesses Coatlicue and Coyalxauhqui, mother and sister to Huitzlipochtli, respectively. Here are displayed the first finds associated with the temple, from the first tentative finds in the 19th century to the discovery of the huge stone disk of Coyolxauhqui, which initiated the Templo Mayor Project.\\r\\nRoom 2 is dedicated to the concepts of ritual and sacrifice in Tenochtitlan. This room contains urns where dignitaries where interred, funerary offerings, as well as objects associated with self and human sacrificesuch as musical instruments, knives and skulls.\\r\\nRoom 3 demonstrates the economics of the Aztec empire in the form of tribute and trade, with examples of finished products and raw materials from many parts of Mesoamerica. Sala 4 is dedicated to the god Huitzilopochtli. His shrine at the temple was the most important and largest. This room contains various images of him as well as offerings. Also located here are the two large ceramic statues of the god Mictlantecuhtli which were found in the House of the Eagle Warriors who were dedicated to Huitzilopochtli.\\r\\nRoom 5 is dedicated to Tlaloc, the other principal deity of the Aztecs and one of the oldest in Mesoamerica. This room contains various images of the god usually worked in green or volcanic stone or in ceramic. The most prized work is a large pot with the gods face in high relief that still preserves much of the original blue paint. Room 6 is dedicated to the flora and fauna of Mesoamerica at this time, as most contained divine aspects for the Aztecs. Also many of the offerings found at the Templo Mayor were or were made from various plants and animals. Related to Room 6, Room 7 contains exhibits of the agricultural technology of the time, especially in the growing of corn and the construction of chinampas, the so-called \\"floating gardens\\". The last room is Room 8, which is dedicated to the archeology and history of the site.[4]\\r\\nCoordinates: 192606N 990753W? / ?19.43500N 99.13139W? / 19.43500; -99.13139","input":"When was the great temple of tenochtitlan built?"},{"output":"Intel","context":"A microprocessor is a computer processor that incorporates the functions of a central processing unit on a single integrated circuit (IC),[1] or at most a few integrated circuits.[2] The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, digital-integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.\\r\\nThe integration of a whole CPU onto a single chip or on a few chips greatly reduced the cost of processing power, increasing efficiency. Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers by highly automated processes, resulting in a low per-unit cost. Single-chip processors increase reliability because there are many fewer electrical connections to fail. As microprocessor designs improve, the cost of manufacturing a chip (with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size) generally stays the same.\\r\\nBefore microprocessors, small computers had been built using racks of circuit boards with many medium- and small-scale integrated circuits. Microprocessors combined this into one or a few large-scale ICs. Continued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete (see history of computing hardware), with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest embedded systems and handheld devices to the largest mainframes and supercomputers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe internal arrangement of a microprocessor varies depending on the age of the design and the intended purposes of the microprocessor. The complexity of an integrated circuit (IC) is bounded by physical limitations on the number of transistors that can be put onto one chip, the number of package terminations that can connect the processor to other parts of the system, the number of interconnections it is possible to make on the chip, and the heat that the chip can dissipate. Advancing technology makes more complex and powerful chips feasible to manufacture.\\r\\nA minimal hypothetical microprocessor might include only an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and a control logic section. The ALU performs operations such as addition, subtraction, and operations such as AND or OR. Each operation of the ALU sets one or more flags in a status register, which indicate the results of the last operation (zero value, negative number, overflow, or others). The control logic retrieves instruction codes from memory and initiates the sequence of operations required for the ALU to carry out the instruction. A single operation code might affect many individual data paths, registers, and other elements of the processor.\\r\\nAs integrated circuit technology advanced, it was feasible to manufacture more and more complex processors on a single chip. The size of data objects became larger; allowing more transistors on a chip allowed word sizes to increase from 4- and 8-bit words up to today's 64-bit words. Additional features were added to the processor architecture; more on-chip registers sped up programs, and complex instructions could be used to make more compact programs. Floating-point arithmetic, for example, was often not available on 8-bit microprocessors, but had to be carried out in software. Integration of the floating point unit first as a separate integrated circuit and then as part of the same microprocessor chip sped up floating point calculations.\\r\\nOccasionally, physical limitations of integrated circuits made such practices as a bit slice approach necessary. Instead of processing all of a long word on one integrated circuit, multiple circuits in parallel processed subsets of each data word. While this required extra logic to handle, for example, carry and overflow within each slice, the result was a system that could handle, for example, 32-bit words using integrated circuits with a capacity for only four?bits each.\\r\\nThe ability to put large numbers of transistors on one chip makes it feasible to integrate memory on the same die as the processor. This CPU cache has the advantage of faster access than off-chip memory and increases the processing speed of the system for many applications. Processor clock frequency has increased more rapidly than external memory speed, except in the recent past,[when?] so cache memory is necessary if the processor is not delayed by slower external memory.\\r\\nA microprocessor is a general-purpose system. Several specialized processing devices have followed from the technology:\\r\\n32-bit processors have more digital logic than narrower processors, so 32-bit (and wider) processors produce more digital noise and have higher static consumption than narrower processors.[3] Reducing digital noise improves ADC conversion results.[4][5] So, 8- or 16-bit processors can be better than 32-bit processors for system on a chip and microcontrollers that require extremely low-power electronics, or are part of a mixed-signal integrated circuit with noise-sensitive on-chip analog electronics such as high-resolution analog to digital converters, or both.\\r\\nNevertheless, trade-offs apply: running 32-bit arithmetic on an 8-bit chip could end up using more power, as the chip must execute software with multiple instructions. Modern microprocessors go into low power states when possible,[6] and an 8-bit chip running 32-bit calculations would be active for more cycles. This creates a delicate balance between software, hardware and use patterns, and costs.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen manufactured in a similar process, 8-bit microprocessors use less power when operating and less power when sleeping than 32-bit microprocessors.[7]\\r\\nHowever, a 32-bit microprocessor may use less average power than an 8-bit microprocessor when the application requires certain operations such as floating-point math that take many more clock cycles on an 8-bit microprocessor than on a 32-bit microprocessor, so the 8-bit microprocessor spends more time in high-power operating mode.[7][8][9][10]\\r\\nThousands of items that were traditionally not computer-related include microprocessors. These include large and small household appliances, cars (and their accessory equipment units), car keys, tools and test instruments, toys, light switches/dimmers and electrical circuit breakers, smoke alarms, battery packs, and hi-fi audio/visual components (from DVD players to phonograph turntables). Such products as cellular telephones, DVD video system and HDTV broadcast systems fundamentally require consumer devices with powerful, low-cost, microprocessors. Increasingly stringent pollution control standards effectively require automobile manufacturers to use microprocessor engine management systems to allow optimal control of emissions over the widely varying operating conditions of an automobile. Non-programmable controls would require complex, bulky, or costly implementation to achieve the results possible with a microprocessor.\\r\\nA microprocessor control program (embedded software) can be easily tailored to different needs of a product line, allowing upgrades in performance with minimal redesign of the product. Different features can be implemented in different models of a product line at negligible production cost.\\r\\nMicroprocessor control of a system can provide control strategies that would be impractical to implement using electromechanical controls or purpose-built electronic controls. For example, an engine control system in an automobile can adjust ignition timing based on engine speed, load on the engine, ambient temperature, and any observed tendency for knockingallowing an automobile to operate on a range of fuel grades.\\r\\nThe advent of low-cost computers on integrated circuits has transformed modern society. General-purpose microprocessors in personal computers are used for computation, text editing, multimedia display, and communication over the Internet. Many more microprocessors are part of embedded systems, providing digital control over myriad objects from appliances to automobiles to cellular phones and industrial process control.\\r\\nThe first use of the term \\"microprocessor\\" is attributed to Viatron Computer Systems[11] describing the custom integrated circuit used in their System 21 small computer system announced in 1968.\\r\\nBy the late 1960s, designers were striving to integrate the central processing unit (CPU) functions of a computer onto a handful of MOS LSI chips, called microprocessor unit (MPU) chipsets. Building on an earlier Busicom design from 1969, Intel introduced the first commercial microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004, in 1971, followed by its 8-bit microprocessor 8008 in 1972. In 1969, Lee Boysel, b8-bit arithmetic logic units (3800/3804) he designed earlier at Fairchild, created the Four-Phase Systems Inc. AL-1, an 8-bit CPU slice that was expandable to 32-bits. In 1970, Steve Geller and Ray Holt of Garrett AiResearch designed the MP944 chipset to implement the F-14A Central Air Data Computer on six metal-gate chips fabricated by AMI.\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, computer processors were constructed out of small- and medium-scale ICs, each containing from tens of transistors to a few hundred. These were placed and soldered onto printed circuit boards, and often multiple boards were interconnected in a chassis. A large number of discrete logic gates uses more electrical power-and therefore produces more heat-than a more integrated design with fewer ICs. The distance that signals have to travel between ICs on the boards limits a computer's operating system speed.\\r\\nIn the NASA Apollo space missions to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s, all onboard computations for primary guidance, navigation, and control were provided by a small custom processor called \\"The Apollo Guidance Computer\\". It used circuit boards whose only logic elements were three-input NOR gates.[12]\\r\\nThe first microprocessors emerged in the early 1970s and were used for electronic calculators, using binary-coded decimal (BCD) arithmetic on 4-bit words. Other embedded uses of 4-bit and 8-bit microprocessors, such as terminals, printers, various kinds of automation etc., followed soon after. Affordable 8-bit microprocessors with 16-bit addressing also led to the first general-purpose microcomputers from the mid-1970s on.\\r\\nSince the early 1970s, the increase in capacity of microprocessors has followed Moore's law; this originally suggested that the number of components that can be fitted onto a chip doubles every year. With present technology, it is actually every two years,[13] and as a result Moore later changed the period to two years.[14]\\r\\nThree projects delivered a microprocessor at about the same time: Garrett AiResearch's Central Air Data Computer (CADC), Texas Instruments (TI) TMS 1000 (1971 September) and Intel's 4004 (1971 November, based on an earlier 1969 Busicom design). Arguably, Four-Phase Systems AL1 microprocessor was also delivered in 1969.\\r\\nIn 1968, Garrett AiResearch (who employed designers Ray Holt and Steve Geller) was invited to produce a digital computer to compete with electromechanical systems then under development for the main flight control computer in the US Navy's new F-14 Tomcat fighter. The design was complete by 1970, and used a MOS-based chipset as the core CPU. The design was significantly (approximately 20 times) smaller and much more reliable than the mechanical systems it competed against, and was used in all of the early Tomcat models. This system contained \\"a 20-bit, pipelined, parallel multi-microprocessor\\". The Navy refused to allow publication of the design until 1997. For this reason the CADC, and the MP944 chipset it used, are fairly unknown.Ray Holt's autobiographical story of this design and development is presented in the book: The Accidental Engineer.[15] [16]\\r\\nRay Holt graduated from California Polytechnic University in 1968, and began his computer design career with the CADC. From its inception, it was shrouded in secrecy until 1998 when at Holt's request, the US Navy allowed the documents into the public domain. Since then people[who?] have debated whether this was the first microprocessor. Holt has stated that no one has compared this microprocessor with those that came later.[17] According to Parab et al. (2007),\\r\\nThe scientific papers and literature published around 1971 reveal that the MP944 digital processor used for the F-14 Tomcat aircraft of the US Navy qualifies as the first microprocessor. Although interesting, it was not a single-chip processor, as was not the Intel 4004?ÿ they both were more like a set of parallel building blocks you could use to make a general-purpose form. It contains a CPU, RAM, ROM, and two other support chips like the Intel 4004. It was made from the same P-channel technology, operated at military specifications and had larger chips?ÿ an excellent computer engineering design by any standards. Its design indicates a major advance over Intel, and two year earlier. It actually worked and was flying in the F-14 when the Intel 4004 was announced. It indicates that today's industry theme of converging DSP-microcontroller architectures was started in 1971.[18]\\r\\nThis convergence of DSP and microcontroller architectures is known as a digital signal controller.[19]\\r\\nThe Four-Phase Systems AL1 was an 8-bit bit slice chip containing eight registers and an ALU.[20] It was designed by Lee Boysel in 1969.[21][22][23] At the time, it formed part of a nine-chip, 24-bit CPU with three AL1s, but it was later called a microprocessor when, in response to 1990s litigation by Texas Instruments, a demonstration system was constructed where a single AL1 formed part of a courtroom demonstration computer system, together with RAM, ROM, and an input-output device.[24]\\r\\nIn 1971, Pico Electronics[25] and General Instrument (GI) introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a complete single chip calculator IC for the Monroe/Litton Royal Digital III calculator. This chip could also arguably lay claim to be one of the first microprocessors or microcontrollers having ROM, RAM and a RISC instruction set on-chip. The layout for the four layers of the PMOS process was hand drawn at x500 scale on mylar film, a significant task at the time given the complexity of the chip.\\r\\nPico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs. They had significant previous design experience on multiple calculator chipsets with both GI and Marconi-Elliott.[26] The key team members had originally been tasked by Elliott Automation to create an 8-bit computer in MOS and had helped establish a MOS Research Laboratory in Glenrothes, Scotland in 1967.\\r\\nCalculators were becoming the largest single market for semiconductors so Pico and GI went on to have significant success in this burgeoning market. GI continued to innovate in microprocessors and microcontrollers with products including the CP1600, IOB1680 and PIC1650.[27] In 1987, the GI Microelectronics business was spun out into the Microchip PIC microcontroller business.\\r\\nGilbert Hyatt was awarded a patent claiming an invention pre-dating both TI and Intel, describing a \\"microcontroller\\".[28] The patent was later invalidated, but not before substantial royalties were paid out.[29][30]\\r\\nThe Smithsonian Institution says TI engineers Gary Boone and Michael Cochran succeeded in creating the first microcontroller (also called a microcomputer) and the first single-chip CPU in 1971. The result of their work was the TMS 1000, which went on the market in 1974.[31] TI stressed the 4-bit TMS 1000 for use in pre-programmed embedded applications, introducing a version called the TMS1802NC on September 17, 1971 that implemented a calculator on a chip.\\r\\nTI filed for a patent on the microprocessor. Gary Boone was awarded U.S. Patent 3,757,306 for the single-chip microprocessor architecture on September 4, 1973. In 1971, and again in 1976, Intel and TI entered into broad patent cross-licensing agreements, with Intel paying royalties to TI for the microprocessor patent. A history of these events is contained in court documentation from a legal dispute between Cyrix and Intel, with TI as inventor and owner of the microprocessor patent.\\r\\nA computer-on-a-chip combines the microprocessor core (CPU), memory, and I/O (input/output) lines onto one chip. The computer-on-a-chip patent, called the \\"microcomputer patent\\" at the time, U.S. Patent 4,074,351, was awarded to Gary Boone and Michael J. Cochran of TI. Aside from this patent, the standard meaning of microcomputer is a computer using one or more microprocessors as its CPU(s), while the concept defined in the patent is more akin to a microcontroller.\\r\\nThe Intel 4004 is generally regarded as the first commercially available microprocessor,[32][33] and cost US$60 (equivalent to $362.56 in 2017).[34] The first known advertisement for the 4004 is dated November 15, 1971 and appeared in Electronic News. The microprocessor was designed by a team consisting of Italian engineer Federico Faggin, American engineers Marcian Hoff and Stanley Mazor, and Japanese engineer Masatoshi Shima.[35]\\r\\nThe project that produced the 4004 originated in 1969, when Busicom, a Japanese calculator manufacturer, asked Intel to build a chipset for high-performance desktop calculators. Busicom's original design called for a programmable chip set consisting of seven different chips. Three of the chips were to make a special-purpose CPU with its program stored in ROM and its data stored in shift register read-write memory. Ted Hoff, the Intel engineer assigned to evaluate the project, believed the Busicom design could be simplified by using dynamic RAM storage for data, rather than shift register memory, and a more traditional general-purpose CPU architecture. Hoff came up with a four-chip architectural proposal: a ROM chip for storing the programs, a dynamic RAM chip for storing data, a simple I/O device and a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU). Although not a chip designer, he felt the CPU could be integrated into a single chip, but as he lacked the technical know-how the idea remained just a wish for the time being.\\r\\nWhile the architecture and specifications of the MCS-4 came from the interaction of Hoff with Stanley Mazor, a software engineer reporting to him, and with Busicom engineer Masatoshi Shima, during 1969, Mazor and Hoff moved on to other projects. In April 1970, Intel hired Italian engineer Federico Faggin as project leader, a move that ultimately made the single-chip CPU final design a reality (Shima meanwhile designed the Busicom calculator firmware and assisted Faggin during the first six months of the implementation). Faggin, who originally developed the silicon gate technology (SGT) in 1968 at Fairchild Semiconductor[36] and designed the worlds first commercial integrated circuit using SGT, the Fairchild 3708, had the correct background to lead the project into what would become the first commercial general purpose microprocessor. Since SGT was his very own invention, Faggin also used it to create his new methodology for random logic design that made it possible to implement a single-chip CPU with the proper speed, power dissipation and cost. The manager of Intel's MOS Design Department was Leslie L. Vadsz at the time of the MCS-4 development but Vadsz's attention was completely focused on the mainstream business of semiconductor memories so he left the leadership and the management of the MCS-4 project to Faggin, who was ultimately responsible for leading the 4004 project to its realization. Production units of the 4004 were first delivered to Busicom in March 1971 and shipped to other customers in late 1971.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Intel 4004 was followed in 1972 by the Intel 8008, the world's first 8-bit microprocessor. The 8008 was not, however, an extension of the 4004 design, but instead the culmination of a separate design project at Intel, arising from a contract with Computer Terminals Corporation, of San Antonio TX, for a chip for a terminal they were designing,[37] the Datapoint 2200fundamental aspects of the design came not from Intel but from CTC. In 1968, CTC's Vic Poor and Harry Pyle developed the original design for the instruction set and operation of the processor. In 1969, CTC contracted two companies, Intel and Texas Instruments, to make a single-chip implementation, known as the CTC 1201.[38] In late 1970 or early 1971, TI dropped out being unable to make a reliable part. In 1970, with Intel yet to deliver the part, CTC opted to use their own implementation in the Datapoint 2200, using traditional TTL logic instead (thus the first machine to run \\"8008 code\\" was not in fact a microprocessor at all and was delivered a year earlier). Intel's version of the 1201 microprocessor arrived in late 1971, but was too late, slow, and required a number of additional support chips. CTC had no interest in using it. CTC had originally contracted Intel for the chip, and would have owed them US$50,000 (equivalent to $302,136 in 2017) for their design work.[38] To avoid paying for a chip they did not want (and could not use), CTC released Intel from their contract and allowed them free use of the design.[38] Intel marketed it as the 8008 in April, 1972, as the world's first 8-bit microprocessor. It was the basis for the famous \\"Mark-8\\" computer kit advertised in the magazine Radio-Electronics in 1974. This processor had an 8-bit data bus and a 14-bit address bus.[39]\\r\\nThe 8008 was the precursor to the successful Intel 8080 (1974), which offered improved performance over the 8008 and required fewer support chips. Federico Faggin conceived and designed it using high voltage N channel MOS. The Zilog Z80 (1976) was also a Faggin design, using low voltage N channel with depletion load and derivative Intel 8-bit processors: all designed with the methodology Faggin created for the 4004. Motorola released the competing 6800 in August 1974, and the similar MOS Technology 6502 in 1975 (both designed largely by the same people). The 6502 family rivaled the Z80 in popularity during the 1980s.\\r\\nA low overall cost, small packaging, simple computer bus requirements, and sometimes the integration of extra circuitry (e.g. the Z80's built-in memory refresh circuitry) allowed the home computer \\"revolution\\" to accelerate sharply in the early 1980s. This delivered such inexpensive machines as the Sinclair ZX81, which sold for US$99 (equivalent to $266.49 in 2017). A variation of the 6502, the MOS Technology 6510 was used in the Commodore 64 and yet another variant, the 8502, powered the Commodore 128.\\r\\nThe Western Design Center, Inc (WDC) introduced the CMOS WDC 65C02 in 1982 and licensed the design to several firms. It was used as the CPU in the Apple IIe and IIc personal computers as well as in medical implantable grade pacemakers and defibrillators, automotive, industrial and consumer devices. WDC pioneered the licensing of microprocessor designs, later followed by ARM (32-bit) and other microprocessor intellectual property (IP) providers in the 1990s.\\r\\nMotorola introduced the MC6809 in 1978. It was an ambitious and well thought-through 8-bit design that was source compatible with the 6800, and implemented using purely hard-wired logic (subsequent 16-bit microprocessors typically used microcode to some extent, as CISC design requirements were becoming too complex for pure hard-wired logic).\\r\\nAnother early 8-bit microprocessor was the Signetics 2650, which enjoyed a brief surge of interest due to its innovative and powerful instruction set architecture.\\r\\nA seminal microprocessor in the world of spaceflight was RCA's RCA 1802 (aka CDP1802, RCA COSMAC) (introduced in 1976), which was used on board the Galileo probe to Jupiter (launched 1989, arrived 1995). RCA COSMAC was the first to implement CMOS technology. The CDP1802 was used because it could be run at very low power, and because a variant was available fabricated using a special production process, silicon on sapphire (SOS), which provided much better protection against cosmic radiation and electrostatic discharge than that of any other processor of the era. Thus, the SOS version of the 1802 was said to be the first radiation-hardened microprocessor.\\r\\nThe RCA 1802 had a static design, meaning that the clock frequency could be made arbitrarily low, or even stopped. This let the Galileo spacecraft use minimum electric power for long uneventful stretches of a voyage. Timers or sensors would awaken the processor in time for important tasks, such as navigation updates, attitude control, data acquisition, and radio communication. Current versions of the Western Design Center 65C02 and 65C816 have static cores, and thus retain data even when the clock is completely halted.\\r\\nThe Intersil 6100 family consisted of a 12-bit microprocessor (the 6100) and a range of peripheral support and memory ICs. The microprocessor recognised the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer instruction set. As such it was sometimes referred to as the CMOS-PDP8. Since it was also produced by Harris Corporation, it was also known as the Harris HM-6100. By virtue of its CMOS technology and associated benefits, the 6100 was being incorporated into some military designs until the early 1980s.\\r\\nThe first multi-chip 16-bit microprocessor was the National Semiconductor IMP-16, introduced in early 1973. An 8-bit version of the chipset was introduced in 1974 as the IMP-8.\\r\\nOther early multi-chip 16-bit microprocessors include one that Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) used in the LSI-11 OEM board set and the packaged PDP 11/03 minicomputerand the Fairchild Semiconductor MicroFlame 9440, both introduced in 1975ÿ76. In 1975, National introduced the first 16-bit single-chip microprocessor, the National Semiconductor PACE, which was later followed by an NMOS version, the INS8900.\\r\\nAnother early single-chip 16-bit microprocessor was TI's TMS 9900, which was also compatible with their TI-990 line of minicomputers. The 9900 was used in the TI 990/4 minicomputer, the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A home computer, and the TM990 line of OEM microcomputer boards. The chip was packaged in a large ceramic 64-pin DIP package, while most 8-bit microprocessors such as the Intel 8080 used the more common, smaller, and less expensive plastic 40-pin DIP. A follow-on chip, the TMS 9980, was designed to compete with the Intel 8080, had the full TI 990 16-bit instruction set, used a plastic 40-pin package, moved data 8?bits at a time, but could only address 16?KB. A third chip, the TMS 9995, was a new design. The family later expanded to include the 99105 and 99110.\\r\\nThe Western Design Center (WDC) introduced the CMOS 65816 16-bit upgrade of the WDC CMOS 65C02 in 1984. The 65816 16-bit microprocessor was the core of the Apple IIgs and later the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, making it one of the most popular 16-bit designs of all time.\\r\\nIntel \\"upsized\\" their 8080 design into the 16-bit Intel 8086, the first member of the x86 family, which powers most modern PC type computers. Intel introduced the 8086 as a cost-effective way of porting software from the 8080 lines, and succeeded in winning much business on that premise. The 8088, a version of the 8086 that used an 8-bit external data bus, was the microprocessor in the first IBM PC. Intel then released the 80186 and 80188, the 80286 and, in 1985, the 32-bit 80386, cementing their PC market dominance with the processor family's backwards compatibility. The 80186 and 80188 were essentially versions of the 8086 and 8088, enhanced with some onboard peripherals and a few new instructions. Although Intel's 80186 and 80188 were not used in IBM PC type designs,[dubious ÿ discuss] second source versions from NEC, the V20 and V30 frequently were. The 8086 and successors had an innovative but limited method of memory segmentation, while the 80286 introduced a full-featured segmented memory management unit (MMU). The 80386 introduced a flat 32-bit memory model with paged memory management.\\r\\nThe 16-bit Intel x86 processors up to and including the 80386 do not include floating-point units (FPUs). Intel introduced the 8087, 80187, 80287 and 80387 math coprocessors to add hardware floating-point and transcendental function capabilities to the 8086 through 80386 CPUs. The 8087 works with the 8086/8088 and 80186/80188,[40] the 80187 works with the 80186 but not the 80188,[41] the 80287 works with the 80286 and the 80387 works with the 80386. The combination of an x86 CPU and an x87 coprocessor forms a single multi-chip microprocessor; the two chips are programmed as a unit using a single integrated instruction set.[42] The 8087 and 80187 coprocessors are connected in parallel with the data and address buses of their parent processor and directly execute instructions intended for them. The 80287 and 80387 coprocessors are interfaced to the CPU through I/O ports in the CPU's address space, this is transparent to the program, which does not need to know about or access these I/O ports directly; the program accesses the coprocessor and its registers through normal instruction opcodes.\\r\\n16-bit designs had only been on the market briefly when 32-bit implementations started to appear.\\r\\nThe most significant of the 32-bit designs is the Motorola MC68000, introduced in 1979.[dubious ÿ discuss] The 68k, as it was widely known, had 32-bit registers in its programming model but used 16-bit internal data paths, three 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Units, and a 16-bit external data bus (to reduce pin count), and externally supported only 24-bit addresses (internally it worked with full 32?bit addresses). In PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes the MC68000 internal microcode was modified to emulate the 32-bit System/370 IBM mainframe.[43] Motorola generally described it as a 16-bit processor. The combination of high performance, large (16?megabytes or 224?bytes) memory space and fairly low cost made it the most popular CPU design of its class. The Apple Lisa and Macintosh designs made use of the 68000, as did a host of other designs in the mid-1980s, including the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga.\\r\\nThe world's first single-chip fully 32-bit microprocessor, with 32-bit data paths, 32-bit buses, and 32-bit addresses, was the AT&T Bell Labs BELLMAC-32A, with first samples in 1980, and general production in 1982.[44][45] After the divestiture of AT&T in 1984, it was renamed the WE 32000 (WE for Western Electric), and had two follow-on generations, the WE 32100 and WE 32200. These microprocessors were used in the AT&T 3B5 and 3B15 minicomputers; in the 3B2, the world's first desktop super microcomputer; in the \\"Companion\\", the world's first 32-bit laptop computer; and in \\"Alexander\\", the world's first book-sized super microcomputer, featuring ROM-pack memory cartridges similar to today's gaming consoles. All these systems ran the UNIX System V operating system.\\r\\nThe first commercial, single chip, fully 32-bit microprocessor available on the market was the HP FOCUS.\\r\\nIntel's first 32-bit microprocessor was the iAPX 432, which was introduced in 1981, but was not a commercial success. It had an advanced capability-based object-oriented architecture, but poor performance compared to contemporary architectures such as Intel's own 80286 (introduced 1982), which was almost four times as fast on typical benchmark tests. However, the results for the iAPX432 was partly due to a rushed and therefore suboptimal Ada compiler.[citation needed]\\r\\nMotorola's success with the 68000 led to the MC68010, which added virtual memory support. The MC68020, introduced in 1984 added full 32-bit data and address buses. The 68020 became hugely popular in the Unix supermicrocomputer market, and many small companies (e.g., Altos, Charles River Data Systems, Cromemco) produced desktop-size systems. The MC68030 was introduced next, improving upon the previous design by integrating the MMU into the chip. The continued success led to the MC68040, which included an FPU for better math performance. The 68050 failed to achieve its performance goals and was not released, and the follow-up MC68060 was released into a market saturated by much faster RISC designs. The 68k family faded from use in the early 1990s.\\r\\nOther large companies designed the 68020 and follow-ons into embedded equipment. At one point, there were more 68020s in embedded equipment than there were Intel Pentiums in PCs.[46] The ColdFire processor cores are derivatives of the 68020.\\r\\nDuring this time (early to mid-1980s), National Semiconductor introduced a very similar 16-bit pinout, 32-bit internal microprocessor called the NS 16032 (later renamed 32016), the full 32-bit version named the NS 32032. Later, National Semiconductor produced the NS 32132, which allowed two CPUs to reside on the same memory bus with built in arbitration. The NS32016/32 outperformed the MC68000/10, but the NS32332which arrived at approximately the same time as the MC68020did not have enough performance. The third generation chip, the NS32532, was different. It had about double the performance of the MC68030, which was released around the same time. The appearance of RISC processors like the AM29000 and MC88000 (now both dead) influenced the architecture of the final core, the NS32764. Technically advancedwith a superscalar RISC core, 64-bit bus, and internally overclockedit could still execute Series 32000 instructions through real-time translation.\\r\\nWhen National Semiconductor decided to leave the Unix market, the chip was redesigned into the Swordfish Embedded processor with a set of on chip peripherals. The chip turned out to be too expensive for the laser printer market and was killed. The design team went to Intel and there designed the Pentium processor, which is very similar to the NS32764 core internally. The big success of the Series 32000 was in the laser printer market, where the NS32CG16 with microcoded BitBlt instructions had very good price/performance and was adopted by large companies like Canon. By the mid-1980s, Sequent introduced the first SMP server-class computer using the NS 32032. This was one of the design's few wins, and it disappeared in the late 1980s. The MIPS R2000 (1984) and R3000 (1989) were highly successful 32-bit RISC microprocessors. They were used in high-end workstations and servers by SGI, among others. Other designs included the Zilog Z80000, which arrived too late to market to stand a chance and disappeared quickly.\\r\\nThe ARM first appeared in 1985.[47] This is a RISC processor design, which has since come to dominate the 32-bit embedded systems processor space due in large part to its power efficiency, its licensing model, and its wide selection of system development tools. Semiconductor manufacturers generally license cores and integrate them into their own system on a chip products; only a few such vendors are licensed to modify the ARM cores. Most cell phones include an ARM processor, as do a wide variety of other products. There are microcontroller-oriented ARM cores without virtual memory support, as well as symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) applications processors with virtual memory.\\r\\nFrom 1993 to 2003, the 32-bit x86 architectures became increasingly dominant in desktop, laptop, and server markets, and these microprocessors became faster and more capable. Intel had licensed early versions of the architecture to other companies, but declined to license the Pentium, so AMD and Cyrix built later versions of the architecture based on their own designs. During this span, these processors increased in complexity (transistor count) and capability (instructions/second) by at least three orders of magnitude. Intel's Pentium line is probably the most famous and recognizable 32-bit processor model, at least with the public at broad.\\r\\nWhile 64-bit microprocessor designs have been in use in several markets since the early 1990s (including the Nintendo 64 gaming console in 1996), the early 2000s saw the introduction of 64-bit microprocessors targeted at the PC market.\\r\\nWith AMD's introduction of a 64-bit architecture backwards-compatible with x86, x86-64 (also called AMD64), in September 2003, followed by Intel's near fully compatible 64-bit extensions (first called IA-32e or EM64T, later renamed Intel 64), the 64-bit desktop era began. Both versions can run 32-bit legacy applications without any performance penalty as well as new 64-bit software. With operating systems Windows XP x64, Windows Vista x64, Windows 7 x64, Linux, BSD, and macOS that run 64-bit natively, the software is also geared to fully utilize the capabilities of such processors. The move to 64?bits is more than just an increase in register size from the IA-32 as it also doubles the number of general-purpose registers.\\r\\nThe move to 64?bits by PowerPC had been intended since the architecture's design in the early 90s and was not a major cause of incompatibility. Existing integer registers are extended as are all related data pathways, but, as was the case with IA-32, both floating point and vector units had been operating at or above 64?bits for several years. Unlike what happened when IA-32 was extended to x86-64, no new general purpose registers were added in 64-bit PowerPC, so any performance gained when using the 64-bit mode for applications making no use of the larger address space is minimal.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2011, ARM introduced a new 64-bit ARM architecture.\\r\\nIn the mid-1980s to early 1990s, a crop of new high-performance reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessors appeared, influenced by discrete RISC-like CPU designs such as the IBM 801 and others. RISC microprocessors were initially used in special-purpose machines and Unix workstations, but then gained wide acceptance in other roles.\\r\\nThe first commercial RISC microprocessor design was released in 1984, by MIPS Computer Systems, the 32-bit R2000 (the R1000 was not released). In 1986, HP released its first system with a PA-RISC CPU. In 1987, in the non-Unix Acorn computers' 32-bit, then cache-less, ARM2-based Acorn Archimedes became the first commercial success using the ARM architecture, then known as Acorn RISC Machine (ARM); first silicon ARM1 in 1985. The R3000 made the design truly practical, and the R4000 introduced the world's first commercially available 64-bit RISC microprocessor. Competing projects would result in the IBM POWER and Sun SPARC architectures. Soon every major vendor was releasing a RISC design, including the AT&T CRISP, AMD 29000, Intel i860 and Intel i960, Motorola 88000, DEC Alpha.\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, only two 64-bit RISC architectures were still produced in volume for non-embedded applications: SPARC and Power ISA, but as ARM has become increasingly powerful, in the early 2010s, it became the third RISC architecture in the general computing segment.\\r\\nA different approach to improving a computer's performance is to add extra processors, as in symmetric multiprocessing designs, which have been popular in servers and workstations since the early 1990s. Keeping up with Moore's law is becoming increasingly challenging as chip-making technologies approach their physical limits. In response, microprocessor manufacturers look for other ways to improve performance so they can maintain the momentum of constant upgrades.\\r\\nA multi-core processor is a single chip that contains more than one microprocessor core. Each core can simultaneously execute processor instructions in parallel. This effectively multiplies the processor's potential performance by the number of cores, if the software is designed to take advantage of more than one processor core. Some components, such as bus interface and cache, may be shared between cores. Because the cores are physically close to each other, they can communicate with each other much faster than separate (off-chip) processors in a multiprocessor system, which improves overall system performance.\\r\\nIn 2001, IBM introduced the first commercial multi-core processor, the monolithic two-core POWER4. Personal computers did not receive multi-core processors until the 2005 introduction, of the two-core Intel Pentium D. The Pentium D, however, was not a monolithic multi-core processor. It was constructed from two dies, each containing a core, packaged on a multi-chip module. The first monolithic multi-core processor in the personal computer market was the AMD Athlon X2, which was introduced a few weeks after the Pentium D. As of 2012[update], dual- and quad-core processors are widely used in home PCs and laptops, while quad-, six-, eight-, ten-, twelve-, and sixteen-core processors are common in the professional and enterprise markets with workstations and servers.\\r\\nSun Microsystems has released the Niagara and Niagara 2 chips, both of which feature an eight-core design. The Niagara 2 supports more threads and operates at 1.6?GHz.\\r\\nHigh-end Intel Xeon processors that are on the LGA 775, LGA 1366, and LGA 2011 sockets and high-end AMD Opteron processors that are on the C32 and G34 sockets are DP (dual processor) capable, as well as the older Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9775 also used in an older Mac Pro by Apple and the Intel Skulltrail motherboard. AMD's G34 motherboards can support up to four CPUs and Intel's LGA 1567 motherboards can support up to eight CPUs.\\r\\nModern desktop computers support systems with multiple CPUs, but few applications outside of the professional market can make good use of more than four cores. Both Intel and AMD currently offer fast quad, hex and octa-core desktop CPUs, making multi-CPU systems obsolete for many purposes. The desktop market has been in a transition towards quad-core CPUs since Intel's Core 2 Quad was released and are now common, although dual-core CPUs are still more prevalent. Older or mobile computers are less likely to have more than two cores than newer desktops. Not all software is optimised for multi-core CPUs, making fewer, more powerful cores preferable.\\r\\nAMD offers CPUs with more cores for a given amount of money than similarly priced Intel CPUsbut the AMD cores are somewhat slower, so the two trade blows in different applications depending on how well-threaded the programs running are. For example, Intel's cheapest Sandy Bridge quad-core CPUs often cost almost twice as much as AMD's cheapest Athlon II, Phenom II, and FX quad-core CPUs but Intel has dual-core CPUs in the same price ranges as AMD's cheaper quad-core CPUs. In an application that uses one or two threads, the Intel dual-core CPUs outperform AMD's similarly priced quad-core CPUsand if a program supports three or four threads the cheap AMD quad-core CPUs outperform the similarly priced Intel dual-core CPUs.\\r\\nHistorically, AMD and Intel have switched places as the company with the fastest CPU several times. Intel currently leads on the desktop side of the computer CPU market, with their Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge series. In servers, AMD's new Opterons seem to have superior performance for their price point. This means that AMD are currently more competitive in low- to mid-end servers and workstations that more effectively use fewer cores and threads.\\r\\nTaken to the extreme, this trend also includes manycore designs, with hundreds of cores, with qualitatively different architectures.\\r\\nIn 1997, about 55% of all CPUs sold in the world were 8-bit microcontrollers, of which over 2 billion were sold.[48]\\r\\nIn 2002, less than 10% of all the CPUs sold in the world were 32-bit or more. Of all the 32-bit CPUs sold, about 2% are used in desktop or laptop personal computers. Most microprocessors are used in embedded control applications such as household appliances, automobiles, and computer peripherals. Taken as a whole, the average price for a microprocessor, microcontroller, or DSP is just over US$6 (equivalent to $8.16 in 2017).[49]\\r\\nIn 2003, about US$44 (equivalent to $58.53 in 2017) billion worth of microprocessors were manufactured and sold.[50] Although about half of that money was spent on CPUs used in desktop or laptop personal computers, those count for only about 2% of all CPUs sold.[49] The quality-adjusted price of laptop microprocessors improved ?25% to ?35% per year in 2004ÿ2010, and the rate of improvement slowed to ?15% to ?25% per year in 2010ÿ2013.[51]\\r\\nAbout 10 billion CPUs were manufactured in 2008. Most new CPUs produced each year are embedded.[52]","input":"Who introduced the first micro processor in 1971?"},{"output":"The THUMS Islands or Astronaut Islands","context":"The THUMS Islands or Astronaut Islands are a set of four artificial islands in San Pedro Bay off the coast of Long Beach, California. They were built in 1965 to tap into the East Wilmington Oil Field. The landscaping and sound walls were designed to camouflage the operation and reduce noise, and they are the only decorated oil islands in the United States.[1]\\r\\nAfter a 1964 court case that gave the state of California mineral rights to the area,[2] the islands were built at an estimated cost of $22 million in 1965,[3][4] the islands were operated by THUMS, a consortium named after the parent companies who bid for the island contract: Texaco, Humble (now Exxon), Union Oil, Mobil, and Shell.[5] The rim of the islands are made of 640,000 tons of boulders from Catalina Island, and the islands were then filled with 3.2 million cubic yards of dredged material from the bay.[2][6] The islands contain significant landscaping, a waterfall, and tall structures concealing the drilling rigs, including one known as The Condo and mistaken for \\"a ritzy hotel\\" by those on land.[2][6] The structures are lit in colored lights at night. The aesthetic mitigation cost $10 million at time of construction, and was overseen by theme park architect Joseph Linesch. They were described by a Los Angeles Times writer as \\"part Disney, part Jetsons, part Swiss Family Robinson\\".[6]\\r\\nIn 1975, the state of California and the city of Long Beach sued the THUMS oil companies for artificially depressing oil prices. A federal jury cleared Exxon of all charges, and the other four oil companies settled out of court for \\"hundreds of millions of dollars\\".[2]\\r\\nThe islands and operation were purchased by Occidental Petroleum in 2000.[7]\\r\\nSince 1967, they have been known as the Astronaut Islands, having been renamed in honor of four American astronauts who lost their lives in the service of NASA. Island Freeman (Theodore C. \\"Ted\\" Freeman) is named for the first astronaut to perish in active duty (piloting a T-38 Talon jet trainer).[8][9] Island Grissom (Virgil I. \\"Gus\\" Grissom), Island White (Edward H. White II), and Island Chaffee (Roger B. Chaffee) are named after the Apollo 1 astronauts (launch pad accident).\\r\\nA peak of 148,495 barrels per day (23,608.8?m3/d) were produced in 1969.[10] 300 million barrels (48,000,000?m3) of oil were pumped from THUMS by 1974,[3] the 500 millionth barrel of crude oil was pumped in 1980.[10] By 1992, the pumping volume was 44,444 barrels (7,066.0?m3) of oil per day through the water injection method of oil recovery, producing low-grade crude oil.[11] By April 2002, the 900 millionth barrel of oil was pumped.[12] The pumped oil contained 20% water in 1965, and by 1994 it was 92% water.[13]\\r\\nIsland Grissom is the closest to land, containing waterfalls and more sculptured screens than the other islands.[14] The screens and decorations also serve to deter the public from swimming to the islands (trespassers are subject to arrest).\\r\\nIsland Freeman is the largest of the islands, at 12 acres (4.9?ha).[7]","input":"What are the islands in long beach ca?"},{"output":"water ice","context":"The rings of Saturn are the most extensive planetary ring system of any planet in the Solar System. They consist of countless small particles, ranging from m to m in size,[1] that orbit about Saturn. The ring particles are made almost entirely of water ice, with a trace component of rocky material. There is still no consensus as to their mechanism of formation; some features of the rings suggest a relatively recent origin, but theoretical models indicate they are likely to have formed early in the Solar System's history.[2]\\r\\nAlthough reflection from the rings increases Saturn's brightness, they are not visible from Earth with unaided vision. In 1610, the year after Galileo Galilei turned a telescope to the sky, he became the first person to observe Saturn's rings, though he could not see them well enough to discern their true nature. In 1655, Christiaan Huygens was the first person to describe them as a disk surrounding Saturn.[3] Although many people think of Saturn's rings as being made up of a series of tiny ringlets (a concept that goes back to Laplace),[3] true gaps are few. It is more correct to think of the rings as an annular disk with concentric local maxima and minima in density and brightness.[2] On the scale of the clumps within the rings there is much empty space.\\r\\nThe rings have numerous gaps where particle density drops sharply: two opened by known moons embedded within them, and many others at locations of known destabilizing orbital resonances with Saturn's moons. Other gaps remain unexplained. Stabilizing resonances, on the other hand, are responsible for the longevity of several rings, such as the Titan Ringlet and the G Ring.\\r\\nWell beyond the main rings is the Phoebe ring, which is tilted at an angle of 27 degrees to the other rings and, like Phoebe, orbits in retrograde fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGalileo Galilei was the first to observe the rings of Saturn in 1610 using his telescope, but was unable to identify them as such. He wrote to the Duke of Tuscany that \\"The planet Saturn is not alone, but is composed of three, which almost touch one another and never move nor change with respect to one another. They are arranged in a line parallel to the zodiac, and the middle one (Saturn itself) is about three times the size of the lateral ones.\\"[4] He also described the rings as Saturn's \\"ears\\". In 1612 the Earth passed through the plane of the rings and they became invisible. Mystified, Galileo remarked \\"I do not know what to say in a case so surprising, so unlooked for and so novel.\\"[3] He mused, \\"Has Saturn swallowed his children?\\"  referring to the myth of the Titan Saturn devouring his offspring to forestall the prophecy of them overthrowing him.[4] He was further confused when the rings again became visible in 1613.[3]\\r\\nEarly astronomers used anagrams as a form of commitment scheme to lay claim to new discoveries before their results were ready for publication. Galileo used smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras for Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi (\\"I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form\\") for discovering the rings of Saturn.[5]\\r\\nIn 1655, Christiaan Huygens became the first person to suggest that Saturn was surrounded by a ring. Using a 50G power refracting telescope that he designed himself, far superior to those available to Galileo, Huygens observed Saturn and wrote that \\"It [Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic\\".[3] Robert Hooke was another early observer of the rings of Saturn, and noted the casting of shadows on the rings.[6]\\r\\nIn 1675, Giovanni Domenico Cassini determined that Saturn's ring was composed of multiple smaller rings with gaps between them; the largest of these gaps was later named the Cassini Division. This division is a 4,800-km-wide region between the A Ring and B Ring.[7]\\r\\nIn 1787, Pierre-Simon Laplace proved that a uniform solid ring would be unstable and suggested that the rings were composed of a large number of solid ringlets.[3][8]\\r\\nIn 1859, James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that a nonuniform solid ring, solid ringlets or a continuous fluid ring would also not be stable, indicating that the ring must be composed of numerous small particles, all independently orbiting Saturn.[8] Later, Sofia Kovalevskaya also found that Saturn's rings cannot be liquid ring-shaped bodies.[9] Spectroscopic studies of the rings carried out in 1895 by James Keeler of Allegheny Observatory and Aristarkh Belopolsky of Pulkovo Observatory showed Maxwell's analysis was correct.\\r\\nFour robotic spacecraft have observed Saturn's rings from the vicinity of the planet. Pioneer 11's closest approach to Saturn occurred in September 1979 at a distance of 20,900?km.[10] Pioneer 11 was responsible for the discovery of the F ring.[10] Voyager 1's closest approach occurred in November 1980 at a distance of 64,200?km.[11] A failed photopolarimeter prevented Voyager 1 from observing Saturn's rings at the planned resolution; nevertheless, images from the spacecraft provided unprecedented detail of the ring system and revealed the existence of the G ring.[12] Voyager 2's closest approach occurred in August 1981 at a distance of 41,000?km.[11] Voyager 2's working photopolarimeter allowed it to observe the ring system at higher resolution than Voyager 1, and to thereby discover many previously unseen ringlets.[13] Cassini spacecraft entered into orbit around Saturn in July 2004.[14] Cassini's images of the rings are the most detailed to-date, and are responsible for the discovery of yet more ringlets.[15]\\r\\nThe rings are named alphabetically in the order they were discovered.[16] The main rings are, working outward from the planet, C, B and A, with the Cassini Division, the largest gap, separating Rings B and A. Several fainter rings were discovered more recently. The D Ring is exceedingly faint and closest to the planet. The narrow F Ring is just outside the A Ring. Beyond that are two far fainter rings named G and E. The rings show a tremendous amount of structure on all scales, some related to perturbations by Saturn's moons, but much unexplained.[16]\\r\\nThe dense main rings extend from 7,000?km (4,300?mi) to 80,000?km (50,000?mi) away from Saturn's equator, whose radius is 60,300?km (37,500?mi) (see Major subdivisions). With an estimated local thickness of as little as 10 m[17] and as much as 1?km,[18] they are composed of 99.9% pure water ice with a smattering of impurities that may include tholins or silicates.[19] The main rings are primarily composed of particles ranging in size from 1?cm to 10 m.[20]\\r\\nBased on Voyager observations, the total mass of the rings was estimated to be about 3?G?1019 kg. This is a small fraction of the total mass of Saturn (about 50?ppb) and is just a little less than the moon Mimas.[21] More recent observations and computer modeling based on Cassini observations show that this may be an underestimate due to clumping in the rings and the mass may be three times this figure.[22] Although the largest gaps in the rings, such as the Cassini Division and Encke Gap, can be seen from Earth, both Voyager spacecraft discovered that the rings have an intricate structure of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets. This structure is thought to arise, in several different ways, from the gravitational pull of Saturn's many moons. Some gaps are cleared out by the passage of tiny moonlets such as Pan,[23] many more of which may yet be discovered, and some ringlets seem to be maintained by the gravitational effects of small shepherd satellites (similar to Prometheus and Pandora's maintenance of the F ring).[citation needed] Other gaps arise from resonances between the orbital period of particles in the gap and that of a more massive moon further out; Mimas maintains the Cassini Division in this manner.[24] Still more structure in the rings consists of spiral waves raised by the inner moons' periodic gravitational perturbations at less disruptive resonances.[citation needed] Data from the Cassini space probe indicate that the rings of Saturn possess their own atmosphere, independent of that of the planet itself. The atmosphere is composed of molecular oxygen gas (O2) produced when ultraviolet light from the Sun interacts with water ice in the rings. Chemical reactions between water molecule fragments and further ultraviolet stimulation create and eject, among other things, O2. According to models of this atmosphere, H2 is also present. The O2 and H2 atmospheres are so sparse that if the entire atmosphere were somehow condensed onto the rings, it would be about one atom thick.[25] The rings also have a similarly sparse OH (hydroxide) atmosphere. Like the O2, this atmosphere is produced by the disintegration of water molecules, though in this case the disintegration is done by energetic ions that bombard water molecules ejected by Saturn's moon Enceladus. This atmosphere, despite being extremely sparse, was detected from Earth by the Hubble Space Telescope.[26] Saturn shows complex patterns in its brightness.[27] Most of the variability is due to the changing aspect of the rings,[28][29] and this goes through two cycles every orbit. However, superimposed on this is variability due to the eccentricity of the planet's orbit that causes the planet to display brighter oppositions in the northern hemisphere than it does in the southern.[30]\\r\\nIn 1980, Voyager 1 made a fly-by of Saturn that showed the F-ring to be composed of three narrow rings that appeared to be braided in a complex structure; it is now known that the outer two rings consist of knobs, kinks and lumps that give the illusion of braiding, with the less bright third ring lying inside them.[citation needed]\\r\\nNew images of the rings taken around the 11 August 2009 equinox of Saturn by NASA's Cassini spacecraft have shown that the rings extend significantly out of the nominal ring plane in a few places. This displacement reaches as much as 4?km (2.5?mi) at the border of the Keeler Gap, due to the out-of-plane orbit of Daphnis, the moon that creates the gap.[31]\\r\\nSaturn's rings may be very old, dating to the formation of Saturn itself. There are two main theories regarding the origin of Saturn's inner rings. One theory, originally proposed by douard Roche in the 19th century, is that the rings were once a moon of Saturn (named Veritas, after a Roman goddess who hid in a well) whose orbit decayed until it came close enough to be ripped apart by tidal forces (see Roche limit).[32] A variation on this theory is that this moon disintegrated after being struck by a large comet or asteroid.[33] The second theory is that the rings were never part of a moon, but are instead left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed.[citation needed]\\r\\nA more traditional version of the disrupted-moon theory is that the rings are composed of debris from a moon 400 to 600?km in diameter, slightly larger than Mimas. The last time there were collisions large enough to be likely to disrupt a moon that large was during the Late Heavy Bombardment some four billion years ago.[34]\\r\\nA more recent variant of this type of theory by R. M. Canup is that the rings could represent part of the remains of the icy mantle of a much larger, Titan-sized, differentiated moon that was stripped of its outer layer as it spiraled into the planet during the formative period when Saturn was still surrounded by a gaseous nebula.[35][36] This would explain the scarcity of rocky material within the rings. The rings would initially have been much more massive (~1,000 times) and broader than at present; material in the outer portions of the rings would have coalesced into the moons of Saturn out to Tethys, also explaining the lack of rocky material in the composition of most of these moons.[36] Subsequent collisional or cryovolcanic evolution of Enceladus might then have caused selective loss of ice from this moon, raising its density to its current value of 1.61 g/cm3, compared to values of 1.15 for Mimas and 0.97 for Tethys.[36]\\r\\nThe idea of massive early rings was subsequently extended to explain the formation of Saturn's moons out to Rhea.[37] If the initial massive rings contained chunks of rocky material (>100?km across) as well as ice, these silicate bodies would have accreted more ice and been expelled from the rings, due to gravitational interactions with the rings and tidal interaction with Saturn, into progressively wider orbits. Within the Roche limit, bodies of rocky material are dense enough to accrete additional material, whereas less-dense bodies of ice are not. Once outside the rings, the newly formed moons could have continued to evolve through random mergers. This process may explain the variation in silicate content of Saturn's moons out to Rhea, as well as the trend towards less silicate content closer to Saturn. Rhea would then be the oldest of the moons formed from the primordial rings, with moons closer to Saturn being progressively younger.[37]\\r\\nThe brightness and purity of the water ice in Saturn's rings has been cited as evidence that the rings are much younger than Saturn, perhaps just 100 million years old, as the infall of meteoric dust would have led to darkening of the rings. However, new research indicates that the B Ring may be massive enough to have diluted infalling material and thus avoided substantial darkening over the age of the Solar System. Ring material may be recycled as clumps form within the rings and are then disrupted by impacts. This would explain the apparent youth of some of the material within the rings.[38] Further evidence supporting a young ring theory has been gathered by researchers analyzing data from the Cassini Titan Radar Mapper, which focused on analyzing the proportion of rocky silicates contained within the C ring.[39]\\r\\nThe Cassini UVIS team, led by Larry Esposito, used stellar occultation to discover 13 objects, ranging from 27 m to 10?km across, within the F ring. They are translucent, suggesting they are temporary aggregates of ice boulders a few m across. Esposito believes this to be the basic structure of the Saturnian rings, particles clumping together, then being blasted apart.[40]\\r\\nThe densest parts of the Saturnian ring system are the A and B Rings, which are separated by the Cassini Division (discovered in 1675 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini). Along with the C Ring, which was discovered in 1850 and is similar in character to the Cassini Division, these regions constitute the main rings. The main rings are denser and contain larger particles than the tenuous dusty rings. The latter include the D Ring, extending inward to Saturn's cloud tops, the G and E Rings and others beyond the main ring system. These diffuse rings are characterised as \\"dusty\\" because of the small size of their particles (often about a m); their chemical composition is, like the main rings, almost entirely water ice. The narrow F Ring, just off the outer edge of the A Ring, is more difficult to categorize; parts of it are very dense, but it also contains a great deal of dust-size particles.\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\n(1) Names as designated by the International Astronomical Union, unless otherwise noted. Broader separations between named rings are termed divisions, while narrower separations within named rings are called gaps.\\r\\n(2) Data mostly from the Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, a NASA factsheet and several papers.[41][42][43]\\r\\n(3) distance is to centre of gaps, rings and ringlets that are narrower than 1,000?km\\r\\n(4) unofficial name\\r\\nThe D Ring is the innermost ring, and is very faint. In 1980, Voyager 1 detected within this ring three ringlets designated D73, D72 and D68, with D68 being the discrete ringlet nearest to Saturn. Some 25 years later, Cassini images showed that D72 had become significantly broader and more diffuse, and had moved planetward by 200?km.[45]\\r\\nPresent in the D Ring is a finescale structure with waves 30?km apart. First seen in the gap between the C Ring and D73,[45] the structure was found during Saturn's 2009 equinox to extend a radial distance of 19,000?km from the D Ring to the inner edge of the B Ring.[46][47] The waves are interpreted as a spiral pattern of vertical corrugations of 2 to 20 m amplitude;[48] the fact that the period of the waves is decreasing over time (from 60?km in 1995 to 30?km by 2006) allows a deduction that the pattern may have originated in late 1983 with the impact of a cloud of debris (with a mass of ~1012 kg) from a disrupted comet that tilted the rings out of the equatorial plane.[45][46][49] A similar spiral pattern in Jupiter's main ring has been attributed to a perturbation caused by impact of material from Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994.[46][50][51]\\r\\nThe C Ring is a wide but faint ring located inward of the B Ring. It was discovered in 1850 by William and George Bond, though William R. Dawes and Johann Galle also saw it independently. William Lassell termed it the \\"Crepe Ring\\" because it seemed to be composed of darker material than the brighter A and B Rings.[52]\\r\\nIts vertical thickness is estimated at 5 m its mass at around 1.1?G?1018 kg, and its optical depth varies from 0.05 to 0.12.[citation needed] That is, between 5 and 12 percent of light shining perpendicularly through the ring is blocked, so that when seen from above, the ring is close to transparent. The 30-km wavelength spiral corrugations first seen in the D Ring were observed during Saturn's equinox of 2009 to extend throughout the C Ring (see above).\\r\\nThe Colombo Gap lies in the inner C Ring. Within the gap lies the bright but narrow Colombo Ringlet, centered at 77,883?km from Saturn's center, which is slightly elliptical rather than circular. This ringlet is also called the Titan Ringlet as it is governed by an orbital resonance with the moon Titan.[53] At this location within the rings, the length of a ring particle's apsidal precession is equal to the length of Titan's orbital motion, so that the outer end of this eccentric ringlet always points towards Titan.[53]\\r\\nThe Maxwell Gap lies within the outer part of the C Ring. It also contains a dense non-circular ringlet, the Maxwell Ringlet. In many respects this ringlet is similar to the  ring of Uranus. There are wave-like structures in the middle of both rings. While the wave in the  ring is thought to be caused by Uranian moon Cordelia, no moon has been discovered in the Maxwell gap as of July 2008.[54]\\r\\nThe B Ring is the largest, brightest, and most massive of the rings. Its thickness is estimated as 5 to 15 m and its optical depth varies from 0.4 to greater than 5,[55] meaning that >99% of the light passing through some parts of the B Ring is blocked. The B Ring contains a great deal of variation in its density and brightness, nearly all of it unexplained. These are concentric, appearing as narrow ringlets, though the B Ring does not contain any gaps.[citation needed]. In places, the outer edge of the B Ring contains vertical structures deviating up to 2.5?km from the main ring plane.\\r\\nA 2016 study of spiral density waves using stellar occultations indicated that the B Ring's surface density is in the range of 40 to 140 g/cm2, lower than previously believed, and that the ring's optical depth has little correlation with its mass density (a finding previously reported for the A and C rings).[55][56] The total mass of the B Ring was estimated to be somewhere in the range of 7 to 7019240000000000000?24G1018 kg. This compares to a mass for Mimas of 7019375000000000000?37.5G1018 kg.[55]\\r\\nUntil 1980, the structure of the rings of Saturn was explained as being caused exclusively by the action of gravitational forces. Then images from the Voyager spacecraft showed radial features in the B ring, known as spokes,[57][58] which could not be explained in this manner, as their persistence and rotation around the rings was not consistent with gravitational orbital mechanics.[59] The spokes appear dark in backscattered light, and bright in forward-scattered light (see images in Gallery); the transition occurs at a phase angle near 60. The leading theory regarding the spokes' composition is that they consist of microscopic dust particles suspended away from the main ring by electrostatic repulsion, as they rotate almost synchronously with the magnetosphere of Saturn. The precise mechanism generating the spokes is still unknown, although it has been suggested that the electrical disturbances might be caused by either lightning bolts in Saturn's atmosphere or micrometeoroid impacts on the rings.[59]\\r\\nThe spokes were not observed again until some twenty-five years later, this time by the Cassini space probe. The spokes were not visible when Cassini arrived at Saturn in early 2004. Some scientists speculated that the spokes would not be visible again until 2007, based on models attempting to describe their formation. Nevertheless, the Cassini imaging team kept looking for spokes in images of the rings, and they were next seen in images taken on 5 September 2005.[60]\\r\\nThe spokes appear to be a seasonal phenomenon, disappearing in the Saturnian midwinter and midsummer and reappearing as Saturn comes closer to equinox. Suggestions that the spokes may be a seasonal effect, varying with Saturn's 29.7-year orbit, were supported by their gradual reappearance in the later years of the Cassini mission.[61]\\r\\nIn 2009, during equinox, a moonlet embedded in the B ring was discovered from the shadow it cast. It is estimated to be 400?m (1,300?ft) in diameter.[62] The moonlet was given the provisional designation S/2009 S 1.\\r\\nThe Cassini Division is a region 4,800?km (3,000?mi) in width between Saturn's A Ring and B Ring. It was discovered in 1675 by Giovanni Cassini at the Paris Observatory using a refracting telescope that had a 2.5-inch objective lens with a 20-foot-long focal length and a 90x magnification.[63][64] From Earth it appears as a thin black gap in the rings. However, Voyager discovered that the gap is itself populated by ring material bearing much similarity to the C Ring.[54] The division may appear bright in views of the unlit side of the rings, since the relatively low density of material allows more light to be transmitted through the thickness of the rings (see second image in gallery).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe inner edge of the Cassini Division is governed by a strong orbital resonance. Ring particles at this location orbit twice for every orbit of the moon Mimas.[65] The resonance causes Mimas' pulls on these ring particles to accumulate, destabilizing their orbits and leading to a sharp cutoff in ring density. Many of the other gaps between ringlets within the Cassini Division, however, are unexplained.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Huygens Gap is located at the inner edge of the Cassini Division. It contains the dense, eccentric Huygens Ringlet in the middle. This ringlet exhibits irregular azimuthal variations of geometrical width and optical depth, which may be caused by the nearby 2:1 resonance with Mimas and the influence of the eccentric outer edge of the B-ring. There is an additional narrow ringlet just outside the Huygens Ringlet.[54]\\r\\nThe A Ring is the outermost of the large, bright rings. Its inner boundary is the Cassini Division and its sharp outer boundary is close to the orbit of the small moon Atlas. The A Ring is interrupted at a location 22% of the ring width from its outer edge by the Encke Gap. A narrower gap 2% of the ring width from the outer edge is called the Keeler Gap.\\r\\nThe thickness of the A Ring is estimated to be 10 to 30 m, its surface density from 35 to 40 g/cm2 and its total mass as 4 to 7018500000000000000?5G1018 kg[55] (just under the mass of Hyperion). Its optical depth varies from 0.4 to 0.9.[55]\\r\\nSimilarly to the B Ring, the A Ring's outer edge is maintained by an orbital resonance, in this case the 7:6 resonance with Janus and Epimetheus.[citation needed] Other orbital resonances also excite many spiral density waves in the A Ring (and, to a lesser extent, other rings as well), which account for most of its structure. These waves are described by the same physics that describes the spiral arms of galaxies. Spiral bending waves, also present in the A Ring and also described by the same theory, are vertical corrugations in the ring rather than compression waves.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn April 2014, NASA scientists reported observing the possible formative stage of a new moon near the outer edge of the A Ring.[66][67]\\r\\nThe Encke Gap is a 325-km-wide gap within the A Ring, centered at a distance of 133,590?km from Saturn's center.[68] It is caused by the presence of the small moon Pan,[69] which orbits within it. Images from the Cassini probe have shown that there are at least three thin, knotted ringlets within the gap.[54] Spiral density waves visible on both sides of it are induced by resonances with nearby moons exterior to the rings, while Pan induces an additional set of spiraling wakes (see image in gallery).[54]\\r\\nJohann Encke himself did not observe this gap; it was named in honour of his ring observations. The gap itself was discovered by James Edward Keeler in 1888.[52] The second major gap in the A Ring, discovered by Voyager, was named the Keeler Gap in his honor.[70]\\r\\nThe Encke Gap is a gap because it is entirely within the A Ring. There was some ambiguity between the terms gap and division until the IAU clarified the definitions in 2008; before that, the separation was sometimes called the \\"Encke Division\\".[71]\\r\\nThe Keeler Gap is a 42-km-wide gap in the A Ring, approximately 250?km from the ring's outer edge. The small moon Daphnis, discovered 1 May 2005, orbits within it, keeping it clear.[72] The moon's passage induces waves in the edges of the gap (this is also influenced by its slight orbital eccentricity).[54] Because the orbit of Daphnis is slightly inclined to the ring plane, the waves have a component that is perpendicular to the ring plane, reaching a distance of 1500?m \\"above\\" the plane.[73][74]\\r\\nThe Keeler gap was discovered by Voyager, and named in honor of the astronomer James Edward Keeler. Keeler had in turn discovered and named the Encke Gap in honor of Johann Encke.[52]\\r\\nIn 2006, four tiny \\"moonlets\\" were found in Cassini images of the A Ring.[75] The moonlets themselves are only about a hundred m in diameter, too small to be seen directly; what Cassini sees are the \\"propeller\\"-shaped disturbances the moonlets create, which are several km across. It is estimated that the A Ring contains thousands of such objects. In 2007, the discovery of eight more moonlets revealed that they are largely confined to a 3,000?km belt, about 130,000?km from Saturn's center,[76] and by 2008 over 150 propeller moonlets had been detected.[77] One that has been tracked for several years has been nicknamed Bleriot.[78]\\r\\nThe separation between the A Ring and the F Ring has been named the Roche Division in honor of the French physicist douard Roche.[79] The Roche Division should not be confused with the Roche limit which is the distance at which a large object is so close to a planet (such as Saturn) that the planet's tidal forces will pull it apart.[80] Lying at the outer edge of the main ring system, the Roche Division is in fact close to Saturn's Roche limit, which is why the rings have been unable to accrete into a moon.[81]\\r\\nLike the Cassini Division, the Roche Division is not empty but contains a sheet of material.[citation needed] The character of this material is similar to the tenuous and dusty D, E, and G Rings.[citation needed] Two locations in the Roche Division have a higher concentration of dust than the rest of the region. These were discovered by the Cassini probe imaging team and were given temporary designations: R/2004 S 1, which lies along the orbit of the moon Atlas; and R/2004 S 2, centered at 138,900?km from Saturn's center, inward of the orbit of Prometheus.[82][83]\\r\\nThe F Ring is the outermost discrete ring of Saturn and perhaps the most active ring in the Solar System, with features changing on a timescale of hours.[84] It is located 3,000?km beyond the outer edge of the A Ring.[85] The ring was discovered in 1979 by the Pioneer 11 imaging team.[86] It is very thin, just a few hundred km in radial extent. While the traditional view has been that it is held together by two shepherd moons, Prometheus and Pandora, which orbit inside and outside it,[69] recent studies indicate that only Prometheus contributes to the confinement.[87][88] Numerical simulations suggest the ring was formed when Prometheus and Pandora collided with each other and were partially disrupted.[89]\\r\\nRecent closeup images from the Cassini probe show that the F Ring consists of one core ring and a spiral strand around it.[90] They also show that when Prometheus encounters the ring at its apoapsis, its gravitational attraction creates kinks and knots in the F Ring as the moon 'steals' material from it, leaving a dark channel in the inner part of the ring (see video link and additional F Ring images in gallery). Since Prometheus orbits Saturn more rapidly than the material in the F ring, each new channel is carved about 3.2 degrees in front of the previous one.[84]\\r\\nIn 2008, further dynamism was detected, suggesting that small unseen moons orbiting within the F Ring are continually passing through its narrow core because of perturbations from Prometheus. One of the small moons was tentatively identified as S/2004 S 6.[84]\\r\\nA faint dust ring is present around the region occupied by the orbits of Janus and Epimetheus, as revealed by images taken in forward-scattered light by the Cassini spacecraft in 2006. The ring has a radial extent of about 5,000?km.[91] Its source is particles blasted off the moons' surfaces by meteoroid impacts, which then form a diffuse ring around their orbital paths.[92]\\r\\nThe G Ring (see last image in gallery) is a very thin, faint ring about halfway between the F Ring and the beginning of the E Ring, with its inner edge about 15,000?km inside the orbit of Mimas. It contains a single distinctly brighter arc near its inner edge (similar to the arcs in the rings of Neptune) that extends about one sixth of its circumference, centered on the half-km diameter moonlet Aegaeon, which is held in place by a 7:6 orbital resonance with Mimas.[93][94] The arc is believed to be composed of icy particles up to a few m in diameter, with the rest of the G Ring consisting of dust released from within the arc. The radial width of the arc is about 250?km, compared to a width of 9,000?km for the G Ring as a whole.[93] The arc is thought to contain matter equivalent to a small icy moonlet about a hundred m in diameter.[93] Dust released from Aegaeon and other source bodies within the arc by micrometeoroid impacts drifts outward from the arc because of interaction with Saturn's magnetosphere (whose plasma corotates with Saturn's magnetic field, which rotates much more rapidly than the orbital motion of the G Ring). These tiny particles are steadily eroded away by further impacts and dispersed by plasma drag. Over the course of thousands of years the ring gradually loses mass,[95] which is replenished by further impacts on Aegaeon.\\r\\nA faint ring arc, first detected in September 2006, covering a longitudinal extent of about 10 degrees is associated with the moon Methone. The material in the arc is believed to represent dust ejected from Methone by micrometeoroid impacts. The confinement of the dust within the arc is attributable to a 14:15 resonance with Mimas (similar to the mechanism of confinement of the arc within the G ring).[96][97] Under the influence of the same resonance, Methone librates back and forth in its orbit with an amplitude of 5 of longitude.\\r\\nA faint ring arc, first detected in June 2007, covering a longitudinal extent of about 20 degrees is associated with the moon Anthe. The material in the arc is believed to represent dust knocked off Anthe by micrometeoroid impacts. The confinement of the dust within the arc is attributable to a 10:11 resonance with Mimas. Under the influence of the same resonance, Anthe drifts back and forth in its orbit over 14 of longitude.[96][97]\\r\\nA faint dust ring shares Pallene's orbit, as revealed by images taken in forward-scattered light by the Cassini spacecraft in 2006.[91] The ring has a radial extent of about 2,500?km. Its source is particles blasted off Pallene's surface by meteoroid impacts, which then form a diffuse ring around its orbital path.[92][97]\\r\\nThe E Ring is the second outermost ring and is extremely wide; it consists of many tiny (micron and sub-micron) particles of water ice with silicates, carbon dioxide and ammonia.[98] The E Ring is distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan.[99] Unlike the other rings, it is composed of microscopic particles rather than macroscopic ice chunks. In 2005, the source of the E Ring's material was determined to be cryovolcanic plumes[100][101] emanating from the \\"tiger stripes\\" of the south polar region of the moon Enceladus.[102] Unlike the main rings, the E Ring is more than 2,000?km thick and increases with its distance from Enceladus.[99] Tendril-like structures observed within the E Ring can be related to the emissions of the most active south polar jets of Enceladus.[103]\\r\\nParticles of the E Ring tend to accumulate on moons that orbit within it. The equator of the leading hemisphere of Tethys is tinted slightly blue due to infalling material.[104] The trojan moons Telesto, Calypso, Helene and Polydeuces are particularly affected as their orbits move up and down the ring plane. This results in their surfaces being coated with bright material that smooths out features.[105]\\r\\nIn October 2009, the discovery of a tenuous disk of material just interior to the orbit of Phoebe was reported. The disk was aligned edge-on to Earth at the time of discovery. This disk can be loosely described as another ring. Although very large (as seen from Earth, the apparent size of two full moons[106]), the ring is virtually invisible. It was discovered using NASA's infrared Spitzer Space Telescope,[107] and was seen over the entire range of the observations, which extended from 128 to 207 times the radius of Saturn,[108] with calculations indicating that it may extend outward up to 300 Saturn radii and inward to the orbit of Iapetus at 59 Saturn radii.[109] The ring was subsequently studied using the WISE, Herschel and Cassini spacecraft;[110] WISE observations show that it extends from at least between 50 and 100 to 270 Saturn radii (the inner edge is lost in the planet's glare).[111] Data obtained with WISE indicate the ring particles are small; those with radii of greater than 10?cm comprise 10% or less of the cross-sectional area.[111]\\r\\nPhoebe orbits the planet at a distance ranging from 180 to 250 radii. The ring has a thickness of about 40 radii.[112] Because the ring's particles are presumed to have originated from impacts (micrometeoroid and larger) on Phoebe, they should share its retrograde orbit,[109] which is opposite to the orbital motion of the next inner moon, Iapetus. This ring lies in the plane of Saturn's orbit, or roughly the ecliptic, and thus is tilted 27 degrees from Saturn's equatorial plane and the other rings. Phoebe is inclined by 5 with respect to Saturn's orbit plane (often written as 175, due to Phoebe's retrograde orbital motion), and its resulting vertical excursions above and below the ring plane agree closely with the ring's observed thickness of 40 Saturn radii.\\r\\nThe existence of the ring was proposed in the 1970s by Steven Soter.[109] The discovery was made by Anne J. Verbiscer and Michael F. Skrutskie (of the University of Virginia) and Douglas P. Hamilton (of the University of Maryland, College Park).[108][113] The three had studied together at Cornell University as graduate students.[114]\\r\\nRing material migrates inward due to reemission of solar radiation,[108] with a speed inversely proportional to particle size; a 3?cm particle would migrate from the vicinity of Phoebe to that of Iapetus over the age of the Solar System.[111] The material would thus strike the leading hemisphere of Iapetus. Infall of this material causes a slight darkening and reddening of the leading hemisphere of Iapetus (similar to what is seen on the Uranian moons Oberon and Titania) but does not directly create the dramatic two-tone coloration of that moon.[115] Rather, the infalling material initiates a positive feedback thermal self-segregation process of ice sublimation from warmer regions, followed by vapor condensation onto cooler regions. This leaves a dark residue of \\"lag\\" material covering most of the equatorial region of Iapetus's leading hemisphere, which contrasts with the bright ice deposits covering the polar regions and most of the trailing hemisphere.[116][117][118]\\r\\nSaturn's second largest moon Rhea has been hypothesized to have a tenuous ring system of its own consisting of three narrow bands embedded in a disk of solid particles.[119][120] These putative rings have not been imaged, but their existence has been inferred from Cassini observations in November 2005 of a depletion of energetic electrons in Saturn's magnetosphere near Rhea. The Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) observed a gentle gradient punctuated by three sharp drops in plasma flow on each side of the moon in a nearly symmetric pattern. This could be explained if they were absorbed by solid material in the form of an equatorial disk containing denser rings or arcs, with particles perhaps several dm to approximately a m in diameter. A more recent piece of evidence consistent with the presence of Rhean rings is a set of small ultraviolet-bright spots distributed in a line that extends three quarters of the way around the moon's circumference, within 2 degrees of the equator. The spots have been interpreted as the impact points of deorbiting ring material.[121] However, targeted observations by Cassini of the putative ring plane from several angles have turned up nothing, suggesting that another explanation for these enigmatic features is needed.[122]","input":"What are saturn's rings mostly made of?"},{"output":"April 29, 1868","context":"The Treaty of Fort Laramie (also called the Sioux Treaty of 1868[b]) was an agreement between the United States and the Oglala, Miniconjou, and Brul bands of Lakota people, Yanktonai Dakota and Arapaho Nation[3] signed on April 29, 1868 at Fort Laramie in the Wyoming Territory, guaranteeing the Lakota ownership of the Black Hills, and further land and hunting rights in South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. The Powder River Country was to be henceforth closed to all whites. The treaty ended Red Cloud's War. Animosities over the treaty rose quickly, with neither side fully honoring the terms. Open war again broke out in 1876, and the US Government unilaterally annexed land covered under the treaty in 1877.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Treaty of Fort Laramie, signed in 1851, attempted to resolve disputes between tribes and the US Government, as well as among tribes themselves, in the modern areas of Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota. It set out that the tribes would make peace among one another, allow for certain outside access to their lands (for activities such as travelling, surveying, and the construction of some government outposts and roads), and that tribes would be responsible for wrongs committed by their people. In return, the US Government would offer protection to the tribes, and pay an annuity of $50,000 over 10 to 15 years.[4][5]\\r\\nHowever, the 1851 treaty had a number of shortcomings which contributed to the deterioration of relations, and subsequent violence over the next several years. The federal government never kept its obligation to protect tribal resources and hunting grounds, and only made a single payment toward the annuity. Although the federal government operated via representative democracy, the tribes did so through consensus, and although local chiefs signed the treaty as representatives, they had limited power to control others who themselves had not consented to its terms. Finally, the discovery of gold in the west, and the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad led to substantially increased travel through the area. This increasingly led to clashes between the tribes, settlers, and the US government, and eventually open war beginning in 1866.[4][5][6] That year the United States Department of the Interior called on tribes to negotiate safe passage through the Bozeman Trail, while the United States Department of War moved Henry B. Carrington along with a column of 700 men into the Powder River Basin, sparking Red Cloud's War.[7]\\r\\nAfter losing resolve to continue the war, following defeat in the Fetterman Fight, sustained guerrilla warfare by the Native Americans, exorbitant rates for freight through the area, and difficulty finding contractors to work the rail lines, the US Government, organized the Indian Peace Commission to negotiate an end to ongoing hostilities.[2][8] A peace counsel chosen by the government arrived on April 19, 1868, at Fort Laramie, in what would later become the state of Wyoming.[8][9]:2\\r\\nThe treaty was laid out in a series of 17 articles:\\r\\nArticle I\\r\\nArticle one called for the cessation of hostilities, stating \\"all war between the parties to this agreement shall for ever cease.\\" If crimes were committed by \\"bad men\\" among white settlers, the government agreed to arrest and punish the offender, and reimburse any losses suffered by injured parties. The tribes agreed to turn over criminals among them, any \\"bad men among the Indians,\\" to the government for trial and punishment, and to reimburse any losses suffered by injured parties.[10] These terms effectively relinquished the authority of the tribes to punish crimes committed against them by white settlers. It also provided that if the tribes failed to deliver wrongdoers to the government, the government was authorized to reimburse losses out of annuities owed the tribe.[11]:37\\r\\nSimilar provisions appeared in nine such treaties with various tribes. In practice, the \\"bad men among the whites\\" clause was seldom enforced. The first plaintiff to win a trial case on the provision did so in 2009, based on the 1868 Fort Laramie treaty.[12]:2521\\r\\nArticle II\\r\\nArticle two of the treaty changed the boundaries for tribal land and established the Great Sioux Reservation, to include areas of present day South Dakota west of the Missouri River including the Black Hills. This waz set aside for the \\"absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Indians\\".[10][2] In total, it allicatwd about 25% of the Dakota Territory as it exited at the time.[9]:4 It made the total tribal lands smaller, and moved them further eastward. This was to \\"take away access to the prime buffalo herds that occupied the area and encourage the Sioux to become farmers.\\"[13]:2\\r\\nThe government agreed that no parties, other than those authorized by the treaty, would be allowed to \\"pass over, settle upon, or reside in the territory\\".[10] According to one source writing on article two, \\"What remained unstated in the treaty, but would have been obvious to Sherman and his men, is that land not place in the reservation was to be considered United States property, and not Indian territory.\\"[11]:37ÿ8\\r\\nArticle III\\r\\nArticle three provided for allotments of up to 160 acres (65?ha) of tillable land to be set aside for farming by members of the tribes.[10][14]:15 By 1871, 200 farms of 80 acres (32?ha) and 200 farms of 40 40 acres (16?ha) had been established including 80 homes. By 1877, this had risen to 153 homes \\"50 of which had shingle roofs and most had board floors\\" according to an 1876 report by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.[14]:15\\r\\nArticle IV\\r\\nThe government agreed to build a number of buildings on the reservation:\\r\\nArticle four also provided for the establishment of an agency on the reservation for the purpose of government administration. In practice, five were constructed and two more later added. These original five were composed of the Grand River Agency (Later Standing Rock), Cheyenne River Agency, Whetstone Agency, Crow Creek Agency, and Lower Brul Agency. Another would be set up on the White River, and another on the North Platte River, later moved to also be on the White.[9]:5ÿ6\\r\\nArticle V\\r\\nThe government agreed that the agent for the Bureau of Indian Affairs shall keep his office open to complaints, which he will investigate and forward to the Commissioner. The decision of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of the Interior, \\"shall be binding on the parties\\".[10]\\r\\nArticle VI\\r\\nArticle six laid out provisions for members of the tribes to take legal individual ownership of previously commonly held land, up to 320 acres (130?ha) for the heads of families, and 80 acres (32?ha) for any adult who was not the head of a family.[10][9]:5 This land then \\"may be occupied and held in the exclusive possession of the person selecting it, and of his family, so long as he or they may continue to cultivate it.\\"[10]\\r\\nArticle VII\\r\\nArticle seven addressed education for those aged six to 16, in order to, as the treaty states, \\"insure the civilization of the Indians entering into this treaty\\".[10][9]:5 The tribes agreed to compel both male and females to attend school, and the government agreed to provide a schoolhouse and teacher for every 30 student who could be made to attend.[10]\\r\\nArticle VIII\\r\\nIn article eight, the government agreed to provide seeds, tools, and training for any of the residents who selected tracts of land, and agreed to farm them. This was to be in the amount of up to $100 dollars worth for the first year, and up to $25 worth for the second and third years.[10] These were one of a number of provisions of the treaty designed to encourage farming, rather than hunting, and move the tribes \\"closer to the white man's way of life.\\"[15]:44\\r\\nArticle IX\\r\\nAfter ten years the government may withdraw the individuals from article 13, but if so, will provide $10,000 annually \\"devoted to the education of said Indians ... as will best promote the education and moral improvement of said tribes.\\" These are to be managed by a local Indian agent under the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.[10][16]\\r\\nArticle X\\r\\nArticle 10 provided for an allotment of clothes, and food, in addition to one \\"good American cow\\" and two oxen for each lodge or family who moved to the reservation.[10][9]:5 It further provided for an annual payment over 30 years of $10 for each person who hunted, and $20 for those who farmed, to be used by the Secretary of the Interior for the \\"purchase of such articles as from time to time the condition and necessities of the Indians may indicate to be proper.\\"[10]\\r\\nArticle XI\\r\\nArticle eleven included several provisions stating the tribes agreed to withdraw opposition to the construction of railroads, military posts and roads, and will not attack or capture white settlers or their property. The government agreed to reimburse the tribes for damages cause in the construction of works on the reservation, in the amount assessed by \\"three disinterested commissioners\\" appointed by the President.[10] It guaranteed the tribes access to the area to the north and west of the Black Hills[c] as hunting grounds, \\"so long as the buffalo may range thereon in such numbers as to justify the chase.\\"[17]:4\\r\\nAs one source examined the treaty language with regard to \\"so long as the buffalo may range\\", the tribes considered this language to be a perpetual guarantee, because \\"they could not envision a day when buffalo would not roam the plains\\"; however:\\r\\nThe concept was clear enough to the commissioners  [who] well knew that hide hunters, with Shermans blessing, were already beginning the slaughter that would eventually drive the Indians to complete dependence on the government for their existence.[1]\\r\\nArticle XII\\r\\nArticle seven required the agreement of \\"three-fourths of all the adult male Indians\\" for a treaty with the tribes to \\"be of any validity\\".[11]:44[10] Hedren reflected on article 12 writing that the provision indicated the government \\"already anticipated a time when different needs would demand the abrogation of the treaty terms.\\"[9]:5 These provisions have since been controversial, because subsequent treaties amending that of 1868 did not include the required agreement of three-fourths of adult males, and so under the terms of 1868, are invalid.[13]:2[d]\\r\\nArticle XIII\\r\\nThe government agreed to furnish the tribes with a \\"physician, teachers, carpenter, miller, engineer, farmer, and blacksmiths\\".[16][10]\\r\\nArticle XIV\\r\\nThe government agreed to provide $100 in prizes for those who \\"in the judgment of the agent may grow the most valuable crops for the respective year.\\"[10]\\r\\nArticle XV\\r\\nOnce the promised buildings were constructed, the tribes agreed to regard the reservation as their \\"permanent home\\" and make \\"no permanent settlement elsewhere\\".[10]\\r\\nArticle XVI\\r\\nArticle 16 stated that country north of the North Platte River and east of the Big Horn Mountains would be \\"unceded Indian territory\\" that no white settlers could occupy without the consent of the tribes.[2] This included 33,000,000 acres (13,000,000?ha) of land outside the reservation which were previously set aside by the 1851 treaty, as well as around an additional 25,000,000 acres (10,000,000?ha).[19]:268 As part of this, the government agreed to close the forts associated with the Bozeman Trail. Article 16 did not however, address issues related to important hunting grounds north and northwest of the reservation.[9]:5\\r\\nArticle XVII\\r\\nThe treaty, as agreed to \\"shall be construed as abrogating and annulling all treaties and agreements heretofore entered into.\\"[10]\\r\\nOver the course of 192 days ending November 6, the treaty was signed by a total of 156 Sioux, and 25 Arapaho, in addition to the commissioners, and an additional 34 signatories as witnesses.[20] Although the commissioners signed the document on April 29 along with the Brul, the party broke up in May, with only two remaining at Fort Laramie to conclude talks there, before traveling up the Missouri River to gather additional signatures from tribes elsewhere.[15]:44 Throughout this process, no further amendments were made to the terms. As one writer phrased it, \\"the commissioners essientially cycled Sioux in and out of Fort Laramie ... seeking only the formality of the chiefs' marks and forgoing true agreement in the spirit that the Indians understood it.\\"[12]:2537ÿ8\\r\\nFollowing initial negotiations, those from the Peace Commission did not discuss the conditions of the treaty to subsequent tribes who arrived over the following months to sign. Rather, the treaty was read aloud, and it was allowed \\"some time for the chiefs to speak\\" before \\"instructing them to place their marks on the prepared document.\\"[15]:44 As the source continues:\\r\\nThese tribes had little interest in or understanding of what had taken place at the Fort Laramie councils. They wanted the whites out of their country and would fight as long as necessary.[15]:44\\r\\nThe process of abandoning the forts associated with the Bozeman Trail, as part of the conditions agreed to, proved to be a long process, and was stalled by difficulty arranging the sale of the goods from the fort to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Fort C.F. Smith was not emptied until July 29, and Fort Phil Kearny and Fort Reno until August 1. Once abandoned, Red Cloud and his followers, who had been monitoring the activities of the troops rode down and burned what remained.[15]:45ÿ6\\r\\nThe peace commission dissolved on October 10 after presenting its report to Congress, which among other things, recommended the government \\"cease to recognize the Indian tribes as domestic dependent nations,\\" and that no further \\"treaties shall be made with any Indian tribe.\\"[15]:46 William Dye, the commander at Fort Laramie was left to represent the commission, and met with Red Cloud, who was among the last to sign the treaty on November 6.[9]:3[15]:46 The government remained unwilling to negotiate the terms further, and after two days, Red Cloud is reported to have \\"washed his hands with the dust of the floor\\" and signed, formally ending the war.[15]:46\\r\\nThe US Senate ratified the treaty on Feb. 16, 1869.[21]:1\\r\\nNotable signatories presented in the order they signed are as follows. Two exceptions are included. Henderson was a commissioner, but did not sign the treaty. Red Cloud was among the last to sign, but is listed out-of-order along with the other Oglala.\\r\\nBrul\\r\\nOglala\\r\\nMiniconjou\\r\\nYanctonais\\r\\nAlthough the treaty required the consent of three fourth of the males of the tribes, many did not sign or recognize the results.[4] Others would later complain that the treaty contained complex language that was not well explained in order to avoid arousing suspicion.[13]:1ÿ2 Yet others would not fully learn the terms of the agreement until 1870, when Red Cloud returned from a trip to Washington D.C.[15]:47\\r\\nThe treaty overall, and in comparison with the 1851 agreement, represented a departure from earlier considerations of tribal customs, and demonstrated instead the government's \\"more heavy-handed position with regard to tribal nations, and ... desire to assimilate the Sioux into American property arrangements and social customs.\\"[23]\\r\\nAccording to one source, \\"animosities over the treaty arose almost immediately\\" when a group of Miniconjou were informed they were no long welcome to trade at Fort Laramie, being south of their newly establish territory. This was notwithstanding that the treaty did not make any stipulation that the tribes could not travel outside their land, only that they would not permanently occupy outside land, and only expressly forbid the traveling of white settlers on the reservation.[1]\\r\\nBoth the tribes and the government chose to ignore portions of the treaty, or to \\"comply only as long as conditions met their favor,\\" and between 1869 and 1876, at least seven separate skirmishes occurred.[9]:6ÿ7 The government eventually broke the terms of the treaty following the Black Hills Gold Rush and an expedition into the area by George Armstrong Custer in 1874, and failed to prevent white settlers from moving onto tribal lands. Rising tensions eventually lead again to open conflict in the Great Sioux War of 1876.[6][24][11]:46\\r\\nThe 1868 treaty would be modified three times by the US Congress between 1876 and 1889, each time taking more land originally granted, including unilaterally seizing the Black Hills in 1877.[23]\\r\\nOn June 30, 1980, in United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians,[25] the United States Supreme Court ruled that the government had illegally taken the land. It upheld an award of $15.5 million for the market value of the land in 1877, along with 103 years worth of interest at 5 percent, for an additional $105 million. The Lakota Sioux, however, have refused to accept payment and instead continue to demand the return of the territory from the United States.[26] As of 24?August?2011[update] the Sioux interest on the money has compounded to over 1 billion dollars.[27]\\r\\nMarking the 150th anniversary of the treaty, the South Dakota Legislature passed Senate Resolution 1, reaffirming the legitimacy of the treaty, and according to the original text, illustrating to the federal government that the Sioux are \\"still here\\" and are \\"seeking a future of forward-looking, positive relationships with full respect for the sovereign status of Native American nations confirmed by the treaty.\\"[28][29]\\r\\nOn March 11, 2018, the Governor of Wyoming, Matt Mead signed a similar bill into law, calling on \\"the federal government to uphold its federal trust responsibilities,\\" and calling for a permanent display of the original treaty, on file with the National Archives and Records Administration, in the Wyoming Legislature.[30][31]","input":"When was the treaty of fort laramie signed?"},{"output":"roughly north-easterly direction","context":"The Saint Lawrence River (French: Fleuve Saint-Laurent; Tuscarora: Kahnaw?kye;[3] Mohawk: Kaniatarowanenneh, meaning \\"big waterway\\") is a large river in the middle latitudes of North America. The Saint Lawrence River flows in a roughly north-easterly direction, connecting the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean and forming the primary drainage outflow of the Great Lakes Basin. It traverses the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and is part of the international boundary between Ontario, Canada, and the U.S. state of New York. This river also provides the basis of the commercial Saint Lawrence Seaway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Saint Lawrence River begins at the outflow of Lake Ontario and flows through Gananoque, Brockville, Morristown, Ogdensburg, Massena, Cornwall, Montreal, Trois-Rivires, and Quebec City before draining into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, the largest estuary in the world.[4] The estuary begins at the eastern tip of ?le d'Orlans, just downstream from Quebec City.[2] The river becomes tidal around Quebec City.[5]\\r\\nThe Saint Lawrence River runs 3,058 kilometres (1,900?mi) from the farthest headwater to the mouth and 1,197?km (743.8?mi) from the outflow of Lake Ontario. These numbers include the estuary; without the estuary the length from Lake Ontario is ca. 500 km (ca. 300 mi). The farthest headwater is the North River in the Mesabi Range at Hibbing, Minnesota. Its drainage area, which includes the Great Lakes, the world's largest system of freshwater lakes, is 1,344,200 square kilometres (518,998.5?sq?mi), of which 839,200?km2 (324,016.9?sq?mi) is in Canada and 505,000?km2 (194,981.6?sq?mi) is in the United States. The basin covers parts of Ontario and Quebec in Canada, parts of Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Wisconsin, and nearly the entirety of the state of Michigan in the United States. The average discharge below the Saguenay River is 16,800 cubic metres per second (590,000?cu?ft/s). At Quebec City, it is 12,101?m3/s (427,300?cu?ft/s). The average discharge at the river's source, the outflow of Lake Ontario, is 7,410?m3/s (262,000?cu?ft/s).[2]\\r\\nThe Saint Lawrence River includes Lake Saint-Louis south of Montreal, Lake Saint Francis at Salaberry-de-Valleyfield and Lac Saint-Pierre east of Montreal. It encompasses four archipelagoes: the Thousand Islands chain near Alexandria Bay, New York and Kingston, Ontario; the Hochelaga Archipelago, including the Island of Montreal and ?le Jsus (Laval); the Lake St.?Pierre Archipelago (classified biosphere world reserve by the UNESCO in 2000)[6] and the smaller Mingan Archipelago. Other islands include ?le d'Orlans near Quebec City and Anticosti Island north of the Gasp. It is the second longest river in Canada.\\r\\nLake Champlain and the Ottawa, Richelieu, Saint-Maurice, Saint-Fran?ois and Saguenay rivers drain into the Saint Lawrence.\\r\\nThe Saint Lawrence River is in a seismically active zone where fault reactivation is believed to occur along late Proterozoic to early Paleozoic normal faults related to the opening of Iapetus Ocean. The faults in the area are rift related and are called the Saint Lawrence rift system.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, the Saint Lawrence Valley is a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian division, containing the Champlain and Northern physiographic section.[7] However, in Canada, where most of the valley is, it is instead considered part of a distinct Saint Lawrence Lowlands physiographic division, and not part of the Appalachian division at all.[8]\\r\\nThough the Norse explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the 11th century and were followed by fifteenth and early sixteenth century European mariners, such as John Cabot, the brothers Gaspar, Miguel Corte-Real, and Alonso Sanchez, the first European explorer known to have sailed up the Saint Lawrence River itself was Jacques Cartier. At that time, the land along the river was inhabited by the St. Lawrence Iroquoians; at the time of Cartier's second voyage in 1535. Because Cartier arrived in the estuary on Saint Lawrence's feast day, he named it the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.[9] The Saint Lawrence River is partly within the U.S. and as such is that country's sixth oldest surviving European place-name.[10]\\r\\nThe earliest regular Europeans in the area were the Basques, who came to the St Lawrence Gulf and River in pursuit of whales from the early 16th century. The Basque whalers and fishermen traded with indigenous Americans and set up settlements, leaving vestiges all over the coast of eastern Canada and deep into the Saint Lawrence River. Basque commercial and fishing activity reached its peak before the Armada Invencible's disaster (1588), when the Spanish Basque whaling fleet was confiscated by King Philip II of Spain and largely destroyed. Initially, the whaling galleons from Labourd were not affected by the Spanish defeat.\\r\\nUntil the early 17th century, the French used the name Rivire du Canada to designate the Saint Lawrence upstream to Montreal and the Ottawa River after Montreal. The Saint Lawrence River served as the main route for European exploration of the North American interior, first pioneered by French explorer Samuel de Champlain.\\r\\nControl of the river was crucial to British strategy to capture New France in the Seven Years' War. Having captured Louisbourg in 1758, the British sailed up to Quebec the following year thanks to charts drawn up by James Cook. British troops were ferried via the Saint Lawrence to attack the city from the west, which they successfully did at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The river was used again by the British to defeat the French siege of Quebec under the Chevalier de Lvis in 1760.\\r\\nBecause of the virtually impassable Lachine Rapids, the Saint Lawrence was once continuously navigable only as far as Montreal. Opened in 1825, the Lachine Canal was the first to allow ships to pass the rapids. An extensive system of canals and locks, known as the Saint Lawrence Seaway, was officially opened on 26 June 1959 by Elizabeth II (representing Canada) and President Dwight D. Eisenhower (representing the United States). The Seaway now permits ocean-going vessels to pass all the way to Lake Superior.\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, the Battle of the St. Lawrence involved submarine and anti-submarine actions throughout the lower Saint Lawrence River and the entire Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Strait of Belle Isle and Cabot Strait from May to October 1942, September 1943, and again in October and November 1944. During this time, German U-boats sank several merchant marine ships and three Canadian warships.\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, the river was the subject of a successful ecological campaign (called \\"Save the River\\"), originally responding to planned development by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The campaign was organized, among others, by Abbie Hoffman.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe source of the North River in the Mesabi Range in Minnesota (Seven Beaver Lake) is considered to be the source of the Saint Lawrence River. Because it crosses so many lakes, the water system frequently changes its name.

It is a tradition that can be defined by eight socio-musical elements: mariachi instrumentation and texture, musical genres and subgenres, performance methods and styles, singing styles and forms, dance styles, performative space, performance clothing, and the word \\"mariachi\\". Each element has its own history, originated at varying moments in time and in different regions of the Western Mexican countryside, and some, if not all, had to converge in order for the mariachi tradition to become what it is.\\r\\nFrom the 19th to 20th?century, migrations from rural areas into Guadalajara, along with the Mexican government's cultural promotion gradually re-labeled it as Son style, with its alternative name of mariachi becoming used for the urban form. Modifications of the music include influences from other music such as polkas and waltzes, the addition of trumpets and the use of charro outfits by mariachi musicians. The musical style began to take on national prominence in the first half of the 20th?century, with its promotion at presidential inaugurations and on the radio in the 1920s.\\r\\nIn 2011 UNESCO recognized mariachi as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, joining six other entries on the Mexican list of that category.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the word is disputed, but prominent theories attribute it to indigenous roots. One states that it comes from the name of the wood used to make the dance platform.[2][3] Another states that Mariachi comes from the indigenous name of a tree called pilla or cirimo; yet another states that it came from an image locally called Mara?H (pronounced Mari-Ache).[3][4] In many Mexican cultures they are also called Marietti.[citation needed] Mariachi can refer to the music, the group, or just one musician. The term \\"Mariachi band\\" is also a redundant term to address a Mariachi because the word in itself 'Mariachi' in spanish implies a group of Musicians playing Mariachi music.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe word \\"mariachi\\" was thought to have derived from the French word \\"marriage\\", dating from the French intervention in Mexico in the 1860s, related to the music's appearance at weddings. This was a common explanation on record jackets and travel brochures. This theory was disproven with the appearance of documents that showed that the word existed before this invasion.[5]\\r\\nPrior to the arrival of the Spanish, indigenous music was played with rattles, drums, flutes, and conch-shell horns as part of religious celebrations. The Spanish introduced violins, guitars, harps, brass instruments, and woodwinds, which mostly replaced the native instruments. The Europeans introduced their instruments to use during Mass, but they were quickly adapted to secular events.[2][4] Indigenous and mestizo peoples learned to play and make these instruments, often giving them modified shapes and tunings. In addition to instruments, the Spanish introduced the concept of musical groupswhich, in the colonial period, generally consisted of two violins, a harp, and various guitars. This grouping gave rise to a number of folk musical styles in Mexico.[2]\\r\\nOne of these folk musical styles was the son. This music featured string instruments. Son music divided into various regional varietiesthe variety popular in the Jalisco area was called son jalisciense, whose best known song, also referred to as \\"the mariachi national anthem,\\"[6] is La Negra.[7] Modern mariachi music developed from this son style, with mariachi as an alternative name for son jalisciense. Early mariachi players did not look like those of today; they played only string instruments such as guitars and harps and dressed in typical peasant clothing: white pants and shirts with huarache sandals.[4][7]\\r\\nThose who could play the son jalisciense/mariachi music could find work at haciendas at a higher rate than those who could not.[4]\\r\\nThe distinction of mariachi from the older son jalisciense occurred slowly sometime during the 19th?century. The music originated in the center-west of Mexico. Most claims for its origin lie in the state of Jalisco but neighboring states of Colima, Nayarit, and Michoacn have also claimed it. However, by the late 19th?century, the music was firmly centered in Jalisco.[8] Most legends put the origin of the modern mariachi in the town of Cocula, Jalisco.[2]\\r\\nThe distinction from son to modern mariachi comes from the modification of the music. By the end of the nineteenth century, the European art music tradition was firmly transplanted to Mexico, with opera, salon music, waltzes, and more written and performed both by Europeans and Mexicans in the country. One variety was the salon orchestras called orquestas tpicas that performed in more rural settings, notably in charro outfits. This use of the charro outfit was repeated with urban mariachi in the 1920s.\\r\\nThe Charro outfit was also used in the national Orquestra Tpica Mexicana (Mexican Typical Orchestra), organized in 1884 by Carlo Curti, and touring the United States and Mexico as part of a presentation of nationalism for the Mexican president Porfirio Diaz.[9][10] Curti's Orquestra Tpica Mexicana has been called the \\"predecessor of the Mariachi.\\"[11]\\r\\nAfter the Mexican Revolution, many haciendas had to let workers go, including mariachis. Groups began to wander and play for a fee, which obliged them to incorporate other music into their repertoires, including waltzes and polkas. It also required them to play in public venues. From the late 19th century to the 1930s, Mariachi groups were semi-professional.[4]\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, U.S., record companies began actively recording rural music in other parts of the world. One of these as a recording called Cuarteto Coculense by Columbia, Edison and Victor in 1908 and 1909, recognized as the first mariachi recordings. The music also gained attention in Mexico City when a wealthy hacienda family brought an early Mariachi from Cocula to play for President Porfirio Daz in 1905.[12]\\r\\nThe common perception of the music and look of mariachi developed in the 20th?century, as the music was transformed from a regional rural folk music to an urban phenomenon that came to represent Mexico.[8] The music was first introduced to Mexico City in 1905.[12] During this time, many farm workers moved to the city, including those from Jalisco, which settled around Plaza Garibaldi.[13] These mariachi musicians developed new practices, such as performances in plazas and restaurants. However, it also continued its more traditional venues such as serenades, and performances at major family events.\\r\\nDuring this time, the Mexican government was heavily involved in cultural promotion as a way to create a unified Mexican identity after the end of the Mexican Revolution. One of these efforts was the promotion of mariachi as an international symbol of Mexican identity, first with radio and sound recordings and later with films.[14]\\r\\nMexico built a nationwide radio broadcasting network in the 1920s such as XEB and XEW, which began broadcasting mariachi music as a media production, rather than as a music for social events.[15] This music was already being modified in part due to the advent of sound recording. For example, most son jaliscense songs were longer than the standard three-and-a-half minutes of the then-standard 78?rpm record, forcing the shortening of tunes. Around the same time, the popularity of jazz and Cuban music introduced the trumpet into mariachi, pushing the violins into second place and in some cases, replacing the harp.[4]\\r\\nThe most prized of the mariachis remained those from the state of Jalisco, particularly the areas of Cocula and Tecalitln. They represented Mexico to the people during the Independence Day celebrations in Mexico City in 1933 as well as during Lzaro Crdenas' election campaign in 1936.[4]\\r\\nThe charro tradition was strong in Jalisco, especially in a region called Los Altos. After the Revolution, the charreada became a national sport in Mexico and rings were constructed specifically for them, followed by professional charro associations. With the breakup of the large haciendas, charros were no longer economically necessary but were used as a cultural ideal, especially by the film industry in the mid-20th?century. The first charro movies date from the 1920s, but the first to sing mariachi was Tito Guzar in All en el Rancho Grande in 1936. The character was played by Jorge Negrete in films such as ?Ay, Jalisco... no te rajes! and ?As se quiere en Jalisco! The main characters used his ability to sing mariachi as a way to show strength, virility, and aesthetic beauty.[15] Its use in film also made the music popular and a symbol of ethnic pride for Mexican Americans in the United States.\\r\\nIts use in film also promoted a negative perception of mariachi music. The films associated the charros and mariachi music with machismo, womanizing and drinking, especially of tequila.[4] The reason that the movies did this was that mariachi music was associated with bars and the lower classes in a number of segments of Mexican society in the early 20th?century. This would change in the latter half of the 20th?century, but the music remains strongly associated with tequila.[4]\\r\\nMariachi music and musician became more professional with more formal training starting in the late 1940s and early 1950s, principally due to the success of a major Mariachi by the name of Mariachi Vargas. Their appearance in many films, backing many singing stars and their hiring of a formal musician prompted other mariachis to do the same. The group also expanded adding trumpets, violins and even a classical guitar to become a kind of orchestra, keeping the traditional son/mariachi base while integrating new musical ideas and styles.[2] One other innovation, in contrast to the machismo of the style were the first female mariachi performers, Lola Beltrn and Lucha Villa. One night Mariachi Vargas put Beltrn on stage when she was a teenager. Her versions of Cucurrucucu Paloma and Tres Dias are now considered classics.[7]\\r\\nMany of the traditional sounds of Cocula were lost as mariachi groups incorporated other musical styles that were popular on the radio.[7] New influences have come into the tradition from the Mexican American community in the United States.[16] In both countries, however, the learning of traditional pieces and repertory is still stressed to form a base.[15]\\r\\nThe International Mariachi Festival in Guadalajara is an annual ten-day event that attracts more than 500 mariachis, who perform in concert halls and city streets. Past players include Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitln, Mariachi los Camperos (led by Nati Cano) and Mariachi Amrica.[17]\\r\\nIn Mexico City, the center of mariachi music remains Garibaldi Plaza. The plaza fills with mariachi musicians to solicit gigs from individual songs for passers-by to being hired for events such as weddings and baptisms. They even stand on Eje Central in front of the plaza to flag down passing cars. In 2010, the government renovated the plaza to make it more tourist-friendly, adding new paving, gardens, police, security cameras, painted facades, and a museum dedicated to mariachi and tequila. Although mariachis can be hired in Mexico City over the phone or on the internet, many people still prefer to come to the plaza, hear the musicians and haggle over the price. About 2,500 mariachis hold union cards to work in the plaza, but as many as 4,000 may circulate through on a busy weekend.[13]\\r\\nThe size of a Mariachi group varies depending on the availability of musicians.[3] The usual mariachi group today consists of as many as eight violins, two trumpets and at least one guitar. Traditional mariachi guitars include the vihuela, a high-pitched, round-backed guitar that provides rhythm, and a bass guitar called a guitarr܇n, which also provides rhythm. Sometimes a Mexican folk harp provides bass and ornaments the melody. All are Mexican variations of European instruments.[2][3] There is generally no lead singer as in other kinds of group with all players singing choruses and taking turns singing the lead. Often the lead singer is assigned to a certain song due to voice qualities. Mariachi vocalization shows influences from a number of styles such as bolero (a romantic style), huapango (using falsetto), son jalisciense (an aggressive style) and more. Voices must be strong to be heard over amplified instruments.[3] Vocal style emphasizes operatic qualities and instrumental performance demonstrates a level of virtuosity that reflects advanced musical training. Historically, mariachi groups have been made up of men but there is growing acceptance of female mariachis.[3]\\r\\nAs mariachi groups are expected to play requests, they may need to know hundreds of different songs.[18] Most songs are about machismo, love, betrayal, death, politics, revolutionary heroes and even animals and country life from the genre origins as rural son music. One particularly famous song is La Cucaracha (The Cockroach).[4][18]\\r\\nMost mariachi groups are associated with family and religious celebrations along with serenades. One of the most common pieces played by Mariachis is Las Ma?anitas for birthdays and celebrations of patron saints.[2]\\r\\nIn Mexico, mariachi music can also be found as part of Catholic Mass. The Misa panamericana is a mariachi folk mass sung in Spanish with new arrangements of classic hymns such as \\"Kyrie Eleison\\". This innovation began in 1966 by Canadian priest Jean Marc Leclerc and it moved from a small church to the Cuernavaca Cathedral.[2]\\r\\nMariachi Vargas de Tecalitln is recognized as the oldest and most famous mariachi ensemble, founded by Gaspar Vargas in the late 1890s.[2] They moved from Jalisco to Mexico City and performed for the inauguration of President Lzaro Crdenas.[2] Mariachi Vargas became famous accompanying singers such as Luis Miguel, Lola Beltrn, and Pedro Infante.[19] Mariachi Vargass first recording was in 1937, the same year they appear in Asi es mi Tierra. They appeared in over 200 films in the 20th?century.[20] Silvestre Vargas took over Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitln from his father in 1958 and soon after hired a trained musician, Rubn Fuentes, as musical director. Fuentes along with Vargas were instrumental in the standardization of much of mariachi music, arranging traditional songs and writing new ones that would be performed by many of the legendary performers of the mid-20th?century, such as Pedro Infante, Miguel Aceves Meja, Lola Beltrn and Jos Alfredo Jimnez.[2] Mariachi Vargas still remains, tracing its history in terms of generations, starting in the 1890s, with these generations maintaining the groups authenticity as a Mariachi while the music has evolved. The last Vargas associated with the group died in 1985. That the group still considers itself the original group comes from the notion of passing on the music by generations of musicians, how the original son jaliscense was learned.[21]\\r\\nThe promotion of mariachi as representative of Mexico has led to the formation of mariachi groups in many countries such as Argentina, Aruba, Egypt, Chile, Cuba, Spain, Croatia, Guatemala, Uruguay, Sweden, Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, with groups from these and more countries participating in Guadalajaras International Mariachi and Charreria Conference.[1][17][22]\\r\\nThe music has a strong following in the US, with top groups spending a lot of time on tour.[18]Mariachi Los Camperos received a Grammy nomination for best Mexican-American album.[18] Academic programs allow for instruction by famous mariachi groups and the opportunity to win awards.\\r\\nThe first mariachi groups in the United States were from California. Nati Cano was born in Jalisco in 1939 and moved to Los?Angeles in 1959. He played in many Mariachi groups backing singers but felt mariachi could stand alone. In 1969 he opened a restaurant called La?Fonda in Los Angeles, which featured his group, Los?Camperos, as part of a dinner show. The success of this enterprise, and of Los Camperos in general have inspired many mariachi groups in the United States.[16] In the late 1980s, pop star Linda Ronstadt recorded \\"Canciones de Mi Padre\\" and \\"Ms Canciones\\" with Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitln and others, which helped promote its popularity among Mexican Americans and to non-Mexican Americans.[15]\\r\\nSome U.S.?public schools offer mariachi as part of classes.[23] The first student Mariachi group was begun in 1961 at the University of California, Los?Angeles. This prompted the creation of other student organizations in other parts of California and then in Texas, where the first mariachi festival was held in 1979. Since then, a strong synergy between academic programs and mariachi festivals has developed, which feature students and give mariachi classes and workshops.[24]\\r\\nOnce school programs were limited to border areas such as San Antonio and Tucson but they have spread across the southwest and into other parts of the country, especially since the 1990s. There are at least 500 schools offering classes along with local and state competitions.[23] In some US schools, mariachi ensembles have replaced school bands. Professional groups such as Mariachi Cobre, which regularly performs at Disney World, also spend time teaching in public schools.\\r\\nIn areas with large Mexican-American populations, mariachis are being hired for events outside this ethnic group as well.[16] Outside of schools, the most important venue for the music in the United States is mariachi festivals with the longest running festivals in Tucson and Fresno.[27] The Tucson International Mariachi Conference began in 1982. It originally was held in the downtown but in 2012 moved to the Casino Del Sol. It showcases over 500 elementary, middle, and high schools and college mariachi players.[28] The Las Vegas International Mariachi Festival, established in 1991, is televised on Telemundo and PBS and has headlined artists such as Pedro Fernndez, Ana Gabriel, and American born mariachi singer Pepe Aguilar and more.[29]\\r\\nThe educational movement is controversial with some trained in the traditional manner, who are skeptical about these programs and their potential to change the tradition. The changes, especially standardization of publishing, are slowing impacting mariachi in Mexico. One difficulty of arranging mariachi pieces is that the son jaliscense is based on alternates between 3\\r\\n4 and 6\\r\\n8 time. Much of the published mariachi music is meant for people already familiar with the music to serve as guides, not to novices. On the other hand, many schools have problems recruiting mariachi instructors as many of these do not have required teaching credentials. For this reason, schools often hire trained musicians from outside the mariachi tradition. Many traditional mariachis are concerned that standardization will lead to fossilization and restrict improvisation.[30]\\r\\nOther innovations in the United States have been the incorporation of styles of artists such as Elvis Presley, Freddy Fender and Glenn Miller, as well as the heavy-metal Mariachi band Metalachi.[31] Another is the encouragement of female mariachis including all-female Mariachi groups such as Mariachi Mujer 2000 and Mariachi Divas de Cindy Shea. Mariachi Mujer has performed with Mexican artists such as Vikki Carr, Pablo Montero, Gerardito Fernandez and Nydia Rojas. Mariachi Divas have won 2 Grammy Awards, have toured extensively in the United States and are the official Mariachi of Disneyland Resort in Anaheim.[18] New York's first international all-female mariachi[32] is 2015 Latin Grammy[33] nominated Mariachi Flor de Toloache, who are featured in Dan Auerbach's The Arcs. There is an all-female Mariachi in London, UK, Mariachi Las Adelitas UK, who plays traditional Mexican Mariachi music as well as some English-language covers in Mariachi style.[34] Another well-recognized mariachi from the United States is the Roma High School Mariachi Nuevo Santander, they have landed first place on the Mariachi Vargas Extravanganza competition since 2013. They have participated in competitions around the TX and the U.S. including UIL Mariachi State competitions and the world-known America's Got Talent.\\r\\nThe most common dance technique in mariachi is zapateado, a kind of footwork from Spain.

These activities take the driver's attention away from the road. All distractions compromise the safety of the driver, passengers, bystanders and those in other vehicles.[1]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Department of Transportation, \\"text messaging while driving creates a crash risk 23 times higher than driving while not distracted.\\"[2] Despite these statistics, more than 37% of drivers have admitted to sending or receiving text messages while driving, and 18% admit doing so regularly.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDistractions while driving can be separated into three distinct groups: visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual distraction involves taking one's eyes off the road, while manual distraction involves taking one's hands off the wheel. Cognitive distraction occurs when an individual's focus is not directly on the act of driving and his/her mind \\"wanders\\".[4]\\r\\nDistractions influenced by the advancement of technology, especially text messaging or talking on the phone, can require a combination of visual, manual, and cognitive attention from the driver, thus making these types of distractions particularly dangerous.[5]\\r\\nTexting while driving is the most widely reported form of \\"distracted driving\\", but it is not the only one. Having passengers on the vehicle, changing radio stations, searching for the cell phone charger, or putting make-up on are all distractions that can easily lead to an accident. According to a study made by AAA Foundation for traffic safety, 15 percent of reported crashes were due to a teen driver distracted by talking with a passenger, while another 12 percent of the crashes were because the teen was on a cell phone talking, texting or searching for information while driving. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has determined that distracted driving accounts for 25 percent of all crashes involving teenage drivers.[6]\\r\\nAccording to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2008, nearly 11% of driversapproximately one million individualsused a mobile device at some time. Additionally, 35ÿ50% of drivers admit to cell phone use while driving, while 90% of drivers fear those who do.[7]\\r\\nSome foods and drinks can lead to dangerous distractions. McKeel Hagerty, president of Hagerty Classic Insurance Company, did a study to find out which foods were the worst to try to consume while driving. Coffee was the top offender because of its tendency to spill even if in a cup with a travel lid. Hot soup was second followed by tacos and chili. Hamburgers and barbecued food came in fifth and sixth. Eating while driving is not only dangerous, it's messy and it means you're not watching the road.[8]\\r\\nAccording to a HealthDay poll from November 2011,[3] most adults who drive admit to engaging in distracted driving behaviors. This poll, which included 2,800 American adults, found that:\\r\\nApproximately 24% of adult drivers have browsed the Internet while driving.[9]\\r\\nData from this poll also revealed that younger drivers have a greater tendency to be involved in distracted driving than older individuals. Additionally, males have a greater tendency to engage in distracted driving activities, including driving while drowsy, after drinking alcohol, while reading a map, using a GPS system, or using the Internet.\\r\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a study about distracted driving in 2011. This study presented the following data: In the United States, 69% of the people surveyed between ages 18ÿ64 revealed talking on their cellphone in a period of 30 days prior to the survey. It also disclosed that 31% of drivers in the United States between the ages 18ÿ64, sent or read an email or text message while driving not less than once 30 days prior to the survey.[10] Another survey performed in February 2015 by Harris Poll in the interest of Erie Insurance, shows that in addition to cell phone usage, there are many other causes for distracted driving. This survey also disclosed important information regarding drivers who text and drive by region, gender and age groups. By region, the incidence of people texting and driving in the Northeast was 24%. In the Midwest was 28%, followed by the West and South regions with 30% and 35% respectively. By gender, the survey reveals that men are more inclined to text and drive at 32% over women at 28%. In regard to age groups, the survey found that age groups 18-34, shows a high incidence of texting and driving with 51% followed by age group 35-44 with 39%. The next three age groups are classified as 45-54, 55-64 and 65 and older, with 33%, 14% and 7% respectively.[11]\\r\\nA study in 2013 estimated the following risks of a crash or near-crash among novice drivers:[12]\\r\\nAmong experienced drivers, dialing a cell phone is estimated to increase the risk of a crash or near-crash by odds ratio 2.5.[12]\\r\\nIn September 2010, the NHTSA released a report on distracted driving fatalities for 2009. The NHTSA considers distracted driving to include the following distractions: other occupants in the car, eating, drinking, smoking, adjusting radio, adjusting environmental control, reaching for objects in car, and cell phone use. The report stated that 5,474 people were killed and 448,000 individuals were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers in 2009. Of those individuals killed, 995 were believed to be killed by drivers distracted by cell phones. The report does not state whether this is an under or over representation of the level of cell phone use amongst drivers, or whether there is a causal relationship.[13]\\r\\nThe NHTSA states that 80% of accidents and 16% of highway deaths are the result of distracted drivers. The National Safety Council (NSC) estimates that 1.6 million (25%) of crashes annually are due to cell phone use, and another 1 million (18%) traffic accidents are due to text messaging while driving. These numbers equate to one accident every 24 seconds attributed to distracted driving by cell phone use. The NSC also reported that speaking on a cell phone while driving reduces focus on the road and the act of driving by 37%, irrespective of hands-free cell phone operation.[14]\\r\\nThe US Department of Transportation estimates that reaching for a cell phone distracts a driver for 4.6 seconds, or the equivalent of the length of a football field, if the vehicle is traveling 55 miles per hour.[15] It has been shown that reaching for something inside the vehicle increases the accident risk by 9 times. Texting while driving increases the risk of an auto accident by 23 times.\\r\\nDriving with a dog or any pet can be very dangerous. An uncaged or unharnessed animal can be a constant distraction.[16]\\r\\nDriving with a dog can be very dangerous. According to a national study by AAA (American Automobile Association), 31 percent of the people that responded admitted to being distracted by their dogs. Fifty-nine percent of people that were surveyed had participated in at least one distracting behavior while driving with their dog. Eighty percent of respondents said they'd driven with their pets, and only 17 percent said they used any form of pet restraint. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that looking away from the road for only two seconds doubles a driver's risk of being in a crash.[17]\\r\\nA 2003 study of U.S. crash data states that driver inattention is estimated to be a factor in 20ÿ50 percent of all police-reported crashes. Driver distraction has been determined to be a contributing factor in estimated 8ÿ13 percent of all vehicle crashes. Of distraction-related accidents, cell phone use may range from 1.5 to 5 percent of contributing factors, according to a 2003 study.[18]\\r\\n\\"Outside person, object, or event\\" (commonly known as rubbernecking) is the most reported cause of distraction related accidents, followed by \\"adjusting radio/cassette player/CD\\". \\"Using/dialing cell phone\\" is the eighth most reported cause of distraction-related accidents, according to the study.\\r\\nAccording to the article \\"NHTSA distracted driving guidelines\\" in the August 2013 Motor Age magazine issue, the NHTSA released voluntary guidelines covering the use of in-car infotainment and communication devices, that have some bearing on connected car technologies and telematics. \\"Proposed items include disabling manual text entry and video-based systems prohibiting the display of text messages, social media or Web pages while the car is in motion or in gear. The goal: Don't take the driver's eyes off the road for more than two seconds at a time, or 12 seconds in total by limiting drivers to six inputs or touches to the screen in 12 seconds\\". In 2011, according to the NHTSA, 1/3 of the accidents were caused by distracted driving.[19]\\r\\nDriving and eating is very distracting. A correspondent for the Boston Globe, Lucia Huntington, stated \\"Distracted driving is the cause of many of today's traffic accidents. In a world of ever-extending commutes and busy schedules, eating while operating a vehicle has become the norm, but eating while behind the wheel proves costly for many drivers. Soups, unwieldy burgers, and hot drinks can make steering a car impossible. Although the danger of eating while driving are apparent and well known, drivers ignore them repeatedly, accounting for many crashes and near-misses.\\" During a study done by NHTSA, the NHTSA blames \\"inattentive driving\\" for 80% of all car accidents. 2.1 percent of the total were daydreaming, personal hygiene, and eating. The location of where people live also causes people to eat and drive. Now that people are now living in the suburbs, this has caused a longer commute to work for some. A study done by Toyota found that truck drivers manage their lives out of their trucks. With this fast-paced life style everyone is always on the move, finding time for food can be difficult, but saving time is not worth risking your life or someone else's.[20]\\r\\nA study by Monash University found that having one or more children in the car was 12 times more distracting than talking on a mobile phone while driving.[21]\\r\\nAccording to David Petrie of the Huntington Post, Children in the back seat are the worst distraction for drivers. While the focus on texting while driving is laudable, it has failed to address long-standing issues. In both cases an incoming call and a crying child create a situation where the driver should pull over and not attempt to multitask.[8]\\r\\nA study by AAA found that talking to a passenger was as distracting as talking on a hands-free mobile phone.[22]\\r\\nToday's youth is being blamed for most of the distracted driving, but really adults are at fault too. More than 600 parents and caregivers were surveyed in two Michigan emergency rooms while their children, ages 1ÿ12 years, were being treated for any reason. During this survey, almost 90% of drivers reported engaging in at least one technology-related distraction while driving their children in the past month. The parents who disclosed using the phonehand held or hands freewhile driving were 2.6 times likely to have reportedly been involved in a motor vehicle crash.[23]\\r\\nThe rising annual rate of fatalities from distracted driving corresponds to both the number of cell phone subscriptions per capita, as well as the average number of text messages per month. From 2009 to 2011, the amount of text messages sent increased by nearly 50%.[24]\\r\\nDistracted driving offenders are more likely to report driving while drowsy, going 20 miles per hour over the speed limit, driving aggressively, not stopping at a red light or stop sign, and driving while under the influence of alcohol.[25]\\r\\nThe American Automobile Association (AAA) reports that younger drivers are overwhelmingly more likely than older drivers to text message and talk on cell phones while driving. However, the proportion of drivers aged 35ÿ44 who reported talking on cell phones while driving is not significantly lower than those drivers aged 18ÿ24 who report doing so.[26]\\r\\nCultural change is needed to stop teens from texting while driving. It took ten years to get people to buckle up. Now eighty-five percent of the people buckle up. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator David Strickland says the standards need to be consistent from state to state. The only way to do that is national legislation. Federal seat belt and drunk driving initiatives have already made a difference. In the end, battling distracted driving is going to have to be a cultural change.[8]\\r\\nIn 2011, Shutko and Tijerina reviewed a large naturalistic study of in field operational tests on cars, heavy product vehicles, and commercial vehicles and buses and concluded that:\\r\\nThe somatosensory association, parietal and visual cortices are not significantly activated during simple driving tasks, like driving straight or making a right hand turn. A left turn with no oncoming traffic present a little more activation in the premotor cortex, somatosensory area, visual and parietal cortices, as well as the cerebellum. When oncoming traffic is introduced while trying to makea hand turn, there is a significant activation multiple bilateral regions in the mid-posterior braid, which includes motor and premotor areas, visual, parietal, and somatosensory regions, and the cerebellum.[28]\\r\\nWhen something as simple as answering general knowledge true or false questions are introduced as a distraction to the driver, the brain activity is increased during both straight driving and when turning left with the presence of oncoming traffic. When just driving straight, which showed very little brain activation without distraction, is paired with answering simple questions, there is a significant increase in brain activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally, along with the auditory cortex and parietal lobes. There was also decreased activation in occipital-visual regions of the brain. When a left turn plus traffic, which already yielded the most activation of the undistracted driving tasks, had audio tasks added to the tasking, auditory, motor, somatosensory, visual, parietal, and cerebellar regions were activated. There was also significant additional activation bilaterally in the anterior brain areas, mainly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal polar region.[28]\\r\\nThe areas of the brain that have decreased activation during a moment of multitasking are areas of spatial processing and spatial attention. Because of this, it is important for drivers to focus on only the task at hand, driving. Even though driving becomes a primary cognitive function, when drivers are distracted (e.g.on their cell phones, talking to passengers, or fiddling with the radio), the areas of the brain that need to be activated to safely operate the vehicle are not.[29]\\r\\nDistracted driving is a growing problem in the United States. It is responsible for many deaths that could otherwise be prevented, especially in the younger generation of drivers. In 2008, there were 23,059 accidents involving 16- to 19-year-olds, which led to 194 deaths. Of these deaths, 10% were reported to be caused by distracted driving. Throughout the United States, over 3,000 deaths and 416,000 injuries annually can be attributed to distracted driving.[30] To further illustrate the seriousness of this \\"epidemic,\\" driving while texting is about 4 times more likely to result in an accident than drinking while driving. Not only is distracted driving more likely to result in an accident, but the risk of injury requiring hospital visitation is 3ÿ5 times greater than the rate for other accidents.[31]\\r\\nSome distracted driving accidents include:-\\r\\nIn 2017, Thames Valley Police in England issued a video of a truck driver who killed a family by driving whilst using his mobile phone.[32]\\r\\nIn 2013, numerous people were also killed in the Santiago de Compostela derailment where the driver had been using the telephone.\\r\\nThirty-nine states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) have passed laws related to distracted driving.[33] Additionally, 41 states, DC and Guam have banned text messaging for all drivers, and 10 states, DC and Guam prohibit drivers from holding cell phones while driving,[34] however no state currently completely bans all electronic use device, including hands-free.[35] Each state varies in the restrictions placed upon drivers.[36]\\r\\nCurrent US laws are not strictly enforced. Punishments are so mild that people pay little attention. Drivers are not categorically prohibited from using phones while driving. For example, using earphones to talk and texting with a hands-free device remain legal.[33]\\r\\nLaws have not led to consistent driver compliance. Hand-held mobile phone usage fell in New York in the five months after the hands-free law took effect. However, it returned to near the prior level by the 16-month mark.[37]\\r\\nAnother approach is through education. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and NHTSA conducted a series of initiatives and campaigns, such as \\"One Text or Call Could Wreck It all\\", \\"Stop the Texts, Stop the Wrecks\\" advertisement, and \\"Faces of Distracted Driving\\". The \\"Stop the Texts, Stop the Wrecks\\" commercials advocate safe driving habits via vivid scenarios,[38] attempting to make the consequences of distraction more tangible. The \\"Faces of Distracted Driving\\" is a DOT online video series that focuses on individuals who have been personally affected.[39]\\r\\nThe cell phone providers AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile and several hundred other organizations have teamed up to create the \\"It Can Wait\\" campaign, that started on May 20, 2013 (Wireless Leaders Unite for \\"It Can Wait\\" Campaign to Curb Texting While Driving, 2013). The campaign is an attempt to inform young drivers that no phone call or text message is worth a life.[40]\\r\\nWashington State has also created a video PSA to educate people about the dangers of distracting driving.[citation needed]\\r\\nDr. Paul Atchley, professor of psychology at the University of Kansas, says parents not technology are the key to educating teens about safer driving. \\"The area of the brain that's used in good decision making (the prefrontal cortex) doesn't mature until age 25,\\" according to Dr. Atchley. \\"Until then, parents need to help children make good decisions.\\" Dr. Atchley suggests two steps for parents to help teach good habits\\r\\n1. Have teens place phone in the trunk of the car (or another inaccessible spot) before driving.\\r\\n2. Parents review cell phone records and texting histories. If parents uncover usage while the teen is driving suspend use of both phone and car. \\"Parents are the technology to solve this problem.\\"[42]\\r\\nInsurance providers offer tools such as Telematics2.0 and education.[43]\\r\\nThe Research and Innovative Technology Administration is considering technologies to enhance transportation safety and reduce distracted driving via a program called the \\"Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge.\\"[44]\\r\\nSome employers have taken steps to reduce distracted driving beyond current legislation. The military requires only hands-free use of phones. Freight companies ban cell phone use while driving.[45]\\r\\nIn October 2009, President Obama signed an executive order banning federal employees from sending texts in government cars.[8]\\r\\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood introduced his \\"Blueprint for Ending Distracted Driving,\\" a plan for reducing distracted driving accidents and related deaths.[46] This blueprint encourages the eleven states without distracted driving laws to enact such legislation. It challenges the auto industry to adopt guidelines to reduce the potential for distraction. It recommended that states partner with driving educators on new curriculum materials.[47]\\r\\nAutomakers are providing dashboard and heads-up displays to allow driving information to be available without the driver looking away from the road. Gesture- and voice-based interfaces simplify controlling the vehicle and its services. Mobile applications such as LifeSaver, DriveScribe and TextLimit disable communication when the phone is moving. A similar approach is under investigation by telecom providers.[48]\\r\\nOn January 7, 2014, an article in CNNMoney announced a partnership between AT&T and car manufacturers Audi and Tesla. AT&T head of emerging devices, Glenn Lurie told CNNMoney that these advancements reflect a major step forward in converting cars form mindless machines to intelligent gadgets. AT&T says everything is going to be connected. The car will be easier to use, safer, reduce distracted driving, and deliver infotainment. Mr. Laurie was asked, \\"Will these innovations increase distracted driving?\\" Mr. Laurie replied, \\"Visual distractions will be limited to passengers as drivers can keep their hands on the wheel.\\" One will need only their voice to send messages and communicate with their car.[49]\\r\\nToyota is working on perfecting technology that will monitor driver's eyelids to make sure they are looking at the road. Other carmakers are also working on similar technology. For example, General Motors has a pilot program using it to monitor distraction, and Jaguar Land Rover monitors the driver's eyes to create the 3D image for its \\"Virtual Windscreen\\".[50]\\r\\nCellebrite has reportedly developed a textalyzer device that can be used to scan a vehicle driver's mobile phone after an accident or incident to determine whether the phone was used to make calls or send text messages or e-mails during operation of the vehicle.[51]","input":"When is a driver considered to be inattentive?"},{"output":"named after Abraham Lincoln","context":"","input":"How did the lincoln tunnel get its name?"},{"output":"Nova Bordelon","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen Sugar is an American drama television series created and executive produced by Ava DuVernay, with Oprah Winfrey serving as an executive producer.

It is primarily used for football and is the home field of the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League (NFL) and the Tennessee State Tigers of Tennessee State University. The stadium is also the site of the Franklin American Mortgage Music City Bowl, a postseason college football bowl game played each December, and is occasionally used as a venue for soccer matches. Nissan Stadium is used for large concerts, such as the CMA Music Festival nightly concerts which take place for four days every June. Facilities are included to enable the stadium to host other public events, meetings, parties, and gatherings.\\r\\nNissan Stadium is located on the east bank of the Cumberland River, directly across the river from downtown Nashville and has a listed seating capacity of 69,143.[14][15] Its first event was a preseason game between the Titans and the Atlanta Falcons on August 27, 1999. Since opening in 1999 it has been known by multiple names, including Adelphia Coliseum from 1999 to 2002, The Coliseum from 2002 to 2006, and LP Field from 2006 to 2015.\\r\\nThe stadium features three levels of seating, with the lower bowl completely encompassing the field. The club and upper levels form the stadium's dual towers, rising above the lower bowl along each sideline. All of the stadium's luxury suites are located within the towers. Three levels of suites are located in the stadium's eastern tower: one between the lower and club levels, and two between the club and upper levels. The western tower has only two levels of suites, both between the club and upper levels. The pressbox is located between the lower and club levels in the western tower. Nissan Stadium's dual videoboards are located behind the lower bowl in each end zone.\\r\\nThe playing surface of Nissan Stadium is Tifsport Bermuda Sod, a natural grass. However, the relatively warm climate of Nashville, combined with the wear and tear of hosting a game nearly every weekend, usually results in a resodding of the area \\"between the hashes\\" in late November.\\r\\nOn Nissan Stadium's eastern side is the Titans Pro Shop, a retail store which sells team merchandise. It remains open year-round and maintains an exterior entrance for use on non-event dates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1995 NFL Preseason, the Houston Oilers faced the Washington Redskins in an exhibition game at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee. At the game, Oilers owner Bud Adams met Nashville Mayor Phil Bredesen and began discussing the possibility of moving the team to Middle Tennessee,[citation needed] due to Adams' discontent with the team's lease at the Astrodome and unwillingness of the City of Houston to build a new football-only stadium. Later that fall, Adams and Bredesen announced the team's intent to move to Nashville. The city and team decided to locate a stadium on the eastern bank of the Cumberland River in downtown Nashville, on the site of a blighted industrial development.\\r\\nIn a special referendum on May 7, 1996, voters in Metropolitan Nashville/Davidson County voted to approve partial funding of the proposed stadium. The vote, which allocated US$144?million of public money to the project, passed with a 59% majority.[16] The pro-stadium organization, known as \\"NFL Yes!\\" outspent the anti-stadium group by a ratio of 16:1 during the campaign.\\r\\nThe funds initially would be raised through an increase in the Metro water tax. The ongoing funding is through a 300% increase in Davidson County individual homeowner property taxes. Much of the remaining construction costs were funded through the sale of personal seat licenses. Some State of Tennessee money was allocated to the project, on the condition that the Tennessee State University football team move its home games there, and with the request that the team be named \\"Tennessee\\" (instead of \\"Nashville\\"), which the franchise was planning to do anyway, in an attempt to appeal to the broader region.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe stadium's construction was delayed when the construction site was hit by a tornado that struck downtown Nashville on April 16, 1998 and destroyed several cranes, but the stadium opened in time for the first scheduled event.\\r\\nOn May 3, 2010, the stadium's playing surface was covered with six feet of water due to the heavy rains and flooding from the Cumberland River. The flood also reached down to the locker rooms of the stadium.[17][18]\\r\\nThe stadium received upgrades during the summer of 2012. Among the improvements are a new sound system, high-speed elevators to the upper levels, and LED ribbon boards mounted on the faces of the upper mezzanines. Two new high-definition Lighthouse brand LED video displays measuring 157 feet by 54 feet were installed, replacing the entire end zone scoreboard apparatuses. At the time of installation, the two boards became the second-largest displays in the National Football League (trailing only AT&T Stadium).[19]\\r\\nDuring its construction, the stadium had no official name, though it was generally referred to as \\"The East Bank Stadium\\", a reference to the stadium's location on the eastern bank of the Cumberland River. Upon its completion, it was given the name \\"Adelphia Coliseum\\" in a 15-year, $30?million naming rights arrangement with Adelphia Business Solutions, a subsidiary of the larger Adelphia telecommunications company. However, after Adelphia missed a required payment and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2002, the agreement was abandoned and the stadium became known simply as \\"The Coliseum\\" for four years. (Adelphia itself was dissolved in 2006.)\\r\\nA naming rights deal with Nashville-based Louisiana-Pacific was inked on June 6, 2006. Louisiana-Pacific, which markets itself as \\"LP Building Products\\", paid $30?million over 10 years for naming rights.[20] LP's influence inside the stadium led to the creation of the LP Building Zones in 2007, located beneath the giant scoreboards from Daktronics at the north and south ends of the stadium. The concession stands and restrooms in these two areas were decorated to look like suburban homes using LP products.\\r\\nOn June 24, 2015, car manufacturer Nissan, which has its North American headquarters just south of Nashville in Franklin and operates a large manufacturing plant in nearby Smyrna, bought the naming rights for the stadium in a 20-year contract, rebranding the stadium as Nissan Stadium.[21][22] As part of the sponsor agreement, a 2016 Nissan Titan pickup truck was placed next to the stadium scoreboard.[23]\\r\\nThe Titans have posted an impressive record at Nissan Stadium since moving there in 1999, including winning their first 16 games before losing to the Baltimore Ravens on November 12, 2000. Overall, the Titans are 45ÿ27 in the regular season and 2ÿ2 in playoff games at Nissan Stadium. Every Titans home game (including preseason) has been a sellout since the stadium opened in 1999. This is due to fans purchasing season tickets associated with the personal seat licenses each season ticketholder must own. The seat licenses helped finance construction of the stadium. There is a long waiting list for personal seat licenses, as well as season tickets.\\r\\nOn January 8, 2000, one of the most memorable and debated plays in NFL history took place at then-Adelphia Coliseum. The \\"Music City Miracle\\", as it has come to be known, was a last-minute trick play on a kickoff return that resulted in a touchdown and catapulted the Titans past the Buffalo Bills to the Divisional Playoffs. It also ensured that the Titans would go undefeated in the first season in the team's new home. The victory was seen in front of a franchise-record crowd.[citation needed]\\r\\nNissan Stadium regularly hosts soccer matches featuring the United States men's national team as well as by the women's national team and visiting professional clubs. The venue was first used for soccer on April 20, 2004 in an exhibition game between the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer and Tecos UAG of the Mexican Primera Divisi܇n.[24] Since then Nissan Stadium has been used for friendly matches by the U.S. women versus Canada in 2004, a return of Tecos against rival F.C. Atlas in 2005, and the U.S. men versus Morocco in 2006.[25] The stadium helped host the CONCACAF men's 2008 and 2012 qualifying tournaments for the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics.[26][27]\\r\\nOn April 1, 2009, the U.S. men's national team played a World Cup qualifier beating Trinidad and Tobago, 3ÿ0. The match saw Jozy Altidore become the youngest American to score a hat trick for the national team.[28][29] The U.S. men returned March 29, 2011 falling to Paraguay in a friendly before a record crowd of 29,059 ÿ the largest to attend a soccer game in the state of Tennessee.[30]\\r\\nNissan Stadium was chosen for two games of the Group Stage for the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\\r\\nNissan Stadium can also serve as a large concert venue.

The restaurant serves breakfast before transitioning to its lunch and dinner menu. Chick-fil-A also offers customers catered selections from its menu for special events.[5] Many of the company's values are influenced by its founder's Southern Baptist beliefs;[6] all Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed for business on Sundays as well as on Thanksgiving and Christmas.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chain's origin can be traced to the Dwarf Grill (now the Dwarf House), a restaurant opened by S. Truett Cathy, the chain's former chairman and CEO, in 1946. The restaurant is located in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta,[3] and is near the location of the now-demolished Ford Motor Company Atlanta Assembly Plant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant's patrons.\\r\\nIn 1961, after 15 years in the fast food business, Cathy found a pressure-fryer that could cook the chicken sandwich in the same amount of time it took to cook a fast-food hamburger.[7] Following this discovery, he registered the name Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company's trademarked slogan, \\"We Didn't Invent the Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,\\"[8] refers to their flagship menu item, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich.\\r\\nThe first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall, in a suburb of Atlanta.[3] During the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by opening new franchises in suburban malls' food courts.[9] The first freestanding franchise was opened April 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia,[10] and the company began to focus more on this type of franchise than on the food court type. Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base, most new restaurants are located in Southern suburban areas.[3] In October 2015, the company opened a three-story 5,000-square-foot restaurant in Manhattan that became the largest free-standing Chick-fil-A in the country at that time.[11][12] As of 2016, the chain has approximately 1,950 locations.[3] It also has 31 drive-through-only locations.[3] Chick-fil-A also can be found at universities, hospitals, and airports through licensing agreements.[3]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Atlanta-based company has been the title sponsor of the Peach Bowl, an annual college football bowl game played in Atlanta on New Year's Eve. Chick-fil-A also is a key sponsor of the SEC and the ACC of college athletics.[13][14]\\r\\nThe company expanded for the first time outside of the United States by opening an outlet at the Calgary International Airport in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in May 2014.[15][16] This restaurant is located near the departure area for flights bound for the United States.[15] However, per tradition, it is closed Sundays and Christmas Day.\\r\\nChick-fil-A retains ownership of each restaurant. Chick-fil-A selects the restaurant location and builds it.[17] Chick-fil-A franchisees need only a $10,000 initial investment to become an operator.[18] Each operator is handpicked and goes through a rigorous training program; the interviews plus training can take months and is not an easy process. Chick-fil-A states on their site:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"This is not the right opportunity for you if you:\\r\\n- Are seeking a passive investment in a business.\\r\\n- Want to sell property to Chick-fil-A, Inc.\\r\\n- Are requesting that Chick-fil-A, Inc. build at a specified location.\\r\\n- Are seeking multi-unit franchise opportunities.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis goes to show how vastly different it is to be a Chick-fil-A store operator rather than being part of a regular franchise opportunity.[19] Since 2010, Chick-fil-A has led the fast food industry in average sales per restaurant, despite being open only six days a week,[20] earning an average $4.8 million per restaurant in 2016 (Whataburger was second with $2.7 million per restaurant).[21]\\r\\n\\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" is the chain's most prominent advertising slogan, created by The Richards Group in 1995. The slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring Holstein dairy cows[22] that are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read: \\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" in all capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily halted during a mad cow disease scare on January 1, 2004, so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows replaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an anthropomorphized chicken who still appears as the C on the logo.[23]\\r\\nChick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending cease and desist letters to those they think have infringed on their trademarks.[24] The corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances of the use of an \\"eat more\\" phrase, saying that the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish its value.[25]\\r\\nA 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen prints T-shirts reading: \\"Eat More Kale\\" demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his website.[26] The incident drew criticism from Vermont governor Peter Shumlin, and created backlash against what he termed Chick-fil-A's \\"corporate bullying.\\"[27] On December 11, 2014, Bo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application to trademark his \\"Eat More Kale\\" phrase. A formal announcement of his victory took place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.[28]\\r\\nAfter 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to McCann New York in 2016. Along with the cows, ads included famous people in history in a campaign called \\"Chicken for Breakfast. It's not as crazy as you think.\\"[29]\\r\\nTruett Cathy opened his first restaurant, The Dwarf Grill?ÿ later renamed the Dwarf House?ÿ in Hapeville, Georgia, in 1946, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich there.[3] At the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, in addition to the full-size entrances, there is also an extra small-sized front door.[32] The original Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at 10:00?p.m. on Saturday nights, and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas and reopens at 6?a.m. on Monday mornings and day after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations as well as an animated seven dwarfs display in the back of the restaurant.[32] It was across the street from the former Ford Motor Company factory called Atlanta Assembly.\\r\\nTruett's original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and provide customers a choice of table service, walk-up counter service or a drive-thru window. As of 2012[update], 13 Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants were operating in the metro Atlanta area.[3]\\r\\nIn 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia.[33] Similar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed dinner.[34][35][36] In 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House locations to replace them with Truett's Grill locations.[37][38]\\r\\nS. Truett Cathy was a devout Southern Baptist; his religious beliefs had a major impact on the company.[39] The company's official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists \\"To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\\"[40]\\r\\nCathy's beliefs are also responsible for one of the chain's distinctive features: all Chick-fil-A locations (corporate owned and franchised) are closed on Sundays,[41] as well as on Thanksgiving and Christmas.[42] Cathy states as the final step in his Five-Step recipe for Business Success \\"I was not so committed to financial success that I was willing to abandon my principles and priorities. One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close on Sunday. Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\\"[43]\\r\\nIn an interview with ABC News's Nightline, Truett's son Dan T. Cathy told reporter Vicki Mabrey that the company is also closed on Sundays because \\"by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And Sunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that first Sunday and we've been closed ever since. He figured if he didn't like working on Sundays, that other people didn't either.\\" The younger Cathy also quoted his father as saying, \\"I don't want to ask people to do that what I am not willing to do myself.\\"[44]\\r\\nTheir website states, \\"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our Restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect ÿregardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\\"[45]\\r\\nChick-fil-A's reputation on being closed on Sundays extends to non-traditional locations. In addition to countless shopping malls and airports, a Chick-fil-A location at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will be closed on Sundays despite its main tenant, the Atlanta Falcons, playing most of their home games on Sundays. The location will be open when the Falcons have a Monday night or Thursday night home game, as well as non-Sunday home games of Atlanta United FC and other events at the stadium. On Sundays, the digital signs will be flipped and concessionaire Levy Restaurants will sell nonbranded food and drinks at the location.[46]\\r\\nIn January 2011, the media reported that Chick-fil-A was co-sponsoring a marriage conference with the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), an organization that has opposed same-sex marriage legislation.[47][48][49][50][51] Chick-fil-A clarified that \\"one of our independent Restaurant Operators in Pennsylvania was asked to provide sandwiches to two Art of Marriage video seminars\\".[52] The WinShape Foundation, a charitable organization founded by Truett and his wife, also stated that it would not allow same-sex couples to participate in its marriage retreats.[53]\\r\\nChick-fil-A has donated over $5?million, via WinShape, to groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Of this, more than $3?million was donated primarily to Christian organizations whose agendas included positions that oppose same-sex marriage,[54] with the money donated between 2003 and 2009.[55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62] A total of $1.9?million was donated in 2010 to groups such as the Marriage & Family Foundation, Exodus International, and the Family Research Council (FRC).[63] That year, the FRC, which received $1,000[55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62] was listed as an anti-gay[64] hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[65][66][67] WinShape has also contributed to Christian groups including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Exodus International, the latter is noted for supporting ex-gay conversion therapy.[63] In response, students at several colleges and universities worked to ban or remove the company's restaurants from their campuses. On January 28, 2013, Shane L. Windmeyer, the leader of Campus Pride, suspended their campaign.[68][69][70]\\r\\nIn June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A's chief operating officer Dan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who \\"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\\" were \\"inviting God's judgment on our nation\\".[71][72][73][74][75] Several prominent politicians expressed disapproval.[76] Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno said they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas.[77][78][79] The proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union.[80][81][82] The Jim Henson Company, which had a Pajanimals kids' meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.[83][84][85] Chick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns that had arisen prior to the controversy.[86] Chick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, \\"We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\\"[87]\\r\\nIn response to the controversy, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee initiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott of Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists.[88][89][90] More than 600,000 people RSVPed on Facebook for Huckabee's appreciation event.[89] On August 1, Chick-fil-A restaurants experienced a large show of public support across the nation with the company reporting record-breaking sales.[88][89][90] A consulting firm estimated that the average Chick-fil-A restaurant had 29.9 percent more sales and 367 more customers than it did on a typical Wednesday.[18]\\r\\nIn September 2012, The Civil Rights Agenda (TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A had \\"ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights.\\" Chick-fil-A officials did state in an internal document that they \\"will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation.\\"[91] In a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real Estate, the company states, \\"The WinShape Foundation is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.\\"[92][93]\\r\\nAccording to Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno, Chick-fil-A has a statement of respect for all people regardless of sexual orientation in an internal document called Chick-fil-A: Who We Are. A document released by Chick-fil-A on September 20, 2012, does not mention any organizations opposed to same-sex marriage as being part of Chick-fil-A's donation base. WinShape Marriage will continue to be supported financially, with a stated focus on couple retreats to strengthen marriages.[94]\\r\\nAccording to Focus on the Family's website, CitizenLink.com, \\"Chick-fil-A and its charitable-giving arm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups that support the Biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed to open a franchise in Chicago.\\"[95] Mike Huckabee stated that he \\"talked earlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick Fil-A about the new reports that Chick Fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me this statement.\\" The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website.[96][97]\\r\\nThough Chick-fil-A has always used trans-fat free processes in its chicken sandwiches, anticipating the dietary concerns of consumers, in 2008, it became the first fast-food restaurant to become completely trans-fat free.[98]\\r\\nIn 2011, food blogger and activist Vani Hari wrote a post titled \\"Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?\\" on her website, FoodBabe.com. She noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil with TBHQ.[99] In October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to meet with company executives at its Atlanta, GA headquarters.[100] In December 2013, Chick-fil-A notified Hari that it had eliminated the dye Yellow No. 5 and had reduced the sodium content in its chicken soup. The company also said that it is testing a peanut oil that does not contain TBHQ and that it would start testing sauces and dressings made without high-fructose corn syrup in 2014.[100]\\r\\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration, antibiotics used in livestock, many of which are also used to treat humans, have contributed to the rise of dangerous bacteria. In December 2012, the FDA announced plans to phase out certain antibiotics in the food production industry.[101]\\r\\nIn February 2014, Chick-fil-A announced plans to serve chicken raised without antibiotics in its restaurants nationwide within five years. Chick-fil-A is the first quick service restaurant to set forth a plan and commit to serving only poultry raised without antibiotics.[102]","input":"Where is the first chick fil a located?"},{"output":"Bengali","context":"Unofficial\\r\\nThe official and de facto national language of Bangladesh is Modern Standard Bengali (Literary Bengali).

Delivered to over 250,000 civil rights supporters from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the speech was a defining moment of the Civil Rights Movement.[2]\\r\\nBeginning with a reference to the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed millions of slaves in 1863,[3] King observes that: \\"one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free\\".[4] Toward the end of the speech, King departed from his prepared text for a partly improvised peroration on the theme \\"I have a dream\\", prompted by Mahalia Jackson's cry: \\"Tell them about the dream, Martin!\\"[5] In this part of the speech, which most excited the listeners and has now become its most famous, King described his dreams of freedom and equality arising from a land of slavery and hatred.[6] Jon Meacham writes that, \\"With a single phrase, Martin Luther King Jr. joined Jefferson and Lincoln in the ranks of men who've shaped modern America\\".[7] The speech was ranked the top American speech of the 20th century in a 1999 poll of scholars of public address.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom was partly intended to demonstrate mass support for the civil rights legislation proposed by President Kennedy in June. Martin Luther King and other leaders therefore agreed to keep their speeches calm, also, to avoid provoking the civil disobedience which had become the hallmark of the Civil Rights Movement. King originally designed his speech as a homage to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, timed to correspond with the 100-year centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation.[6]\\r\\nKing had been preaching about dreams since 1960, when he gave a speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) called \\"The Negro and the American Dream\\". This speech discusses the gap between the American dream and reality, saying that overt white supremacists have violated the dream, and that \\"our federal government has also scarred the dream through its apathy and hypocrisy, its betrayal of the cause of justice\\". King suggests that \\"It may well be that the Negro is God's instrument to save the soul of America.\\"[9][10] In 1961, he spoke of the Civil Rights Movement and student activists' \\"dream\\" of equality\\"the American Dream ... a dream as yet unfulfilled\\"in several national speeches and statements, and took \\"the dream\\" as the centerpiece for these speeches.[11]\\r\\nOn November 27, 1962, King gave a speech at Booker T. Washington High School in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. That speech was longer than the version which he would eventually deliver from the Lincoln Memorial. And while parts of the text had been moved around, large portions were identical, including the \\"I have a dream\\" refrain.[12][13] After being rediscovered,[14] the restored and digitized recording of the 1962 speech was presented to the public by the English department of North Carolina State University.[12]\\r\\nMartin Luther King had also delivered a \\"dream\\" speech in Detroit, in June 1963, when he marched on Woodward Avenue with Walter Reuther and the Reverend C. L. Franklin, and had rehearsed other parts.[15]\\r\\nThe March on Washington Speech, known as \\"I Have a Dream Speech\\", has been shown to have had several versions, written at several different times.[16] It has no single version draft, but is an amalgamation of several drafts, and was originally called \\"Normalcy, Never Again\\". Little of this, and another \\"Normalcy Speech\\", ended up in the final draft. A draft of \\"Normalcy, Never Again\\" is housed in the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. Collection of the Robert W. Woodruff Library, Atlanta University Center and Morehouse College.[17] The focus on \\"I have a dream\\" comes through the speech's delivery. Toward the end of its delivery, noted African American gospel singer Mahalia Jackson shouted to King from the crowd, \\"Tell them about the dream, Martin.\\"[18] King departed from his prepared remarks and started \\"preaching\\" improvisationally, punctuating his points with \\"I have a dream.\\"\\r\\nThe speech was drafted with the assistance of Stanley Levison and Clarence Benjamin Jones[19] in Riverdale, New York City. Jones has said that \\"the logistical preparations for the march were so burdensome that the speech was not a priority for us\\" and that, \\"on the evening of Tuesday, Aug. 27, [12 hours before the march] Martin still didn't know what he was going to say\\".[20]\\r\\nLeading up to the speech's rendition at the Great March on Washington, King had delivered its \\"I have a dream\\" refrains in his speech before 25,000 people in Detroit's Cobo Hall immediately after the 125,000-strong Great Walk to Freedom in Detroit, June 23, 1963.[21][22] After the Washington, D.C. March, a recording of King's Cobo Hall speech was released by Detroit's Gordy Records as an LP entitled \\"The Great March To Freedom\\".[23]\\r\\nWidely hailed as a masterpiece of rhetoric, King's speech invokes pivotal documents in American history, including the Declaration of Independence, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the United States Constitution. Early in his speech, King alludes to Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address by saying \\"Five score years ago...\\" In reference to the abolition of slavery articulated in the Emancipation Proclamation, King says: \\"It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\\" Anaphora (i.e., the repetition of a phrase at the beginning of sentences) is employed throughout the speech. Early in his speech, King urges his audience to seize the moment; \\"Now is the time\\" is repeated three times in the sixth paragraph. The most widely cited example of anaphora is found in the often quoted phrase \\"I have a dream\\", which is repeated eight times as King paints a picture of an integrated and unified America for his audience. Other occasions include \\"One hundred years later\\", \\"We can never be satisfied\\", \\"With this faith\\", \\"Let freedom ring\\", and \\"free at last\\". King was the sixteenth out of eighteen people to speak that day, according to the official program.[24]\\r\\nAmong the most quoted lines of the speech include \\"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!\\"[26]\\r\\nAccording to U.S. Representative John Lewis, who also spoke that day as the president of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, \\"Dr. King had the power, the ability, and the capacity to transform those steps on the Lincoln Memorial into a monumental area that will forever be recognized. By speaking the way he did, he educated, he inspired, he informed not just the people there, but people throughout America and unborn generations.\\"[27]\\r\\nThe ideas in the speech reflect King's social experiences of ethnocentric abuse, the mistreatment and exploitation of blacks.[28] The speech draws upon appeals to America's myths as a nation founded to provide freedom and justice to all people, and then reinforces and transcends those secular mythologies by placing them within a spiritual context by arguing that racial justice is also in accord with God's will. Thus, the rhetoric of the speech provides redemption to America for its racial sins.[29] King describes the promises made by America as a \\"promissory note\\" on which America has defaulted. He says that \\"America has given the Negro people a bad check\\", but that \\"we've come to cash this check\\" by marching in Washington, D.C.\\r\\nKing's speech uses words and ideas from his own speeches and other texts. For years, he had spoken about dreams, quoted from Samuel Francis Smith's popular patriotic hymn \\"America\\" (\\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\"), and of course referred extensively to the Bible. The idea of constitutional rights as an \\"unfulfilled promise\\" was suggested by Clarence Jones.[9]\\r\\nThe final passage from King's speech closely resembles Archibald Carey Jr.'s address to the 1952 Republican National Convention: both speeches end with a recitation of the first verse of \\"America\\", and the speeches share the name of one of several mountains from which both exhort \\"let freedom ring\\".[9][30]\\r\\nKing also is said to have built on Prathia Hall's speech at the site of a burned-down African American church in Terrell County, Georgia, in September 1962, in which she used the repeated phrase \\"I have a dream\\".[31] The church burned down after it was used for voter registration meetings.[32]\\r\\nThe speech also alludes to Psalm 30:5[33] in the second stanza of the speech. Additionally, King quotes from Isaiah 40:4ÿ5 (\\"I have a dream that every valley shall be exalted...\\"[34]) and Amos 5:24 (\\"But let justice roll down like water...\\"[35]). He also alludes to the opening lines of Shakespeare's Richard III (\\"Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer...\\") when he remarks that \\"this sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn...\\"\\r\\nThe \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech can be dissected by using three rhetorical lenses: voice merging, prophetic voice, and dynamic spectacle.[36] Voice merging is the combining of one's own voice with religious predecessors. Prophetic voice is using rhetoric to speak for a population. A dynamic spectacle has origins from the Aristotelian definition as \\"a weak hybrid form of drama, a theatrical concoction that relied upon external factors (shock, sensation, and passionate release) such as televised rituals of conflict and social control.\\"[37]\\r\\nVoice merging is a common technique used amongst African American preachers. It combines the voices of previous preachers and excerpts from scriptures along with their own unique thoughts to create a unique voice. King uses voice merging in his peroration when he references the secular hymn \\"America\\".\\r\\nThe rhetoric of King's speech can be compared to the rhetoric of Old Testament prophets. During King's speech, he speaks with urgency and crisis giving him a prophetic voice. The prophetic voice must \\"restore a sense of duty and virtue amidst the decay of venality.\\"[38] An evident example is when King declares that, \\"now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\\"\\r\\nWhy King's speech was powerful is debated, but essentially, it came at a point of many factors combining at a key cultural turning point. Executive speechwriter Anthony Trendl writes, \\"The right man delivered the right words to the right people in the right place at the right time.\\"[39]\\r\\n\\"Given the context of drama and tension in which it was situated\\", King's speech can be classified as a dynamic spectacle.[40] A dynamic spectacle is dependent on the situation in which it is used. It can be considered a dynamic spectacle because it happened at the correct time and place: during the Civil Rights Movement and the March on Washington.\\r\\nThe speech was lauded in the days after the event, and was widely considered the high point of the March by contemporary observers.[41] James Reston, writing for The New York Times, said that \\"Dr. King touched all the themes of the day, only better than anybody else. He was full of the symbolism of Lincoln and Gandhi, and the cadences of the Bible. He was both militant and sad, and he sent the crowd away feeling that the long journey had been worthwhile.\\"[9] Reston also noted that the event \\"was better covered by television and the press than any event here since President Kennedy's inauguration\\", and opined that \\"it will be a long time before [Washington] forgets the melodious and melancholy voice of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. crying out his dreams to the multitude.\\"[42] An article in The Boston Globe by Mary McGrory reported that King's speech \\"caught the mood\\" and \\"moved the crowd\\" of the day \\"as no other\\" speaker in the event.[43] Marquis Childs of The Washington Post wrote that King's speech \\"rose above mere oratory\\".[44] An article in the Los Angeles Times commented that the \\"matchless eloquence\\" displayed by King\\"a supreme orator\\" of \\"a type so rare as almost to be forgotten in our age\\"put to shame the advocates of segregation by inspiring the \\"conscience of America\\" with the justice of the civil-rights cause.[45]\\r\\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which viewed King and his allies for racial justice as subversive, also noticed the speech. This provoked the organization to expand their COINTELPRO operation against the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and to target King specifically as a major enemy of the United States.[46] Two days after King delivered \\"I Have a Dream\\", Agent William C. Sullivan, the head of COINTELPRO, wrote a memo about King's growing influence:\\r\\nIn the light of King's powerful demagogic speech yesterday he stands head and shoulders above all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of Negroes. We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro and national security.[47]\\r\\nThe speech was a success for the Kennedy administration and for the liberal civil rights coalition that had planned it. It was considered a \\"triumph of managed protest\\", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Kennedy had watched King's speech on television and been very impressed. Afterwards, March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with President Kennedy. Kennedy felt the March bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.[48]\\r\\nMeanwhile, some of the more radical Black leaders who were present condemned the speech (along with the rest of the march)[citation needed] as too compromising. Malcolm X later wrote in his autobiography: \\"Who ever heard of angry revolutionaries swinging their bare feet together with their oppressor in lily pad pools, with gospels and guitars and 'I have a dream' speeches?\\"[6]\\r\\nThe March on Washington put pressure on the Kennedy administration to advance its civil rights legislation in Congress.[49] The diaries of Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., published posthumously in 2007, suggest that President Kennedy was concerned that if the march failed to attract large numbers of demonstrators, it might undermine his civil rights efforts.\\r\\nIn the wake of the speech and march, King was named Man of the Year by TIME magazine for 1963, and in 1964, he was the youngest person ever awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[50] The full speech did not appear in writing until August 1983, some 15 years after King's death, when a transcript was published in The Washington Post.[4]\\r\\nIn 1990, the Australian alternative comedy rock band Doug Anthony All Stars released an album called Icon. One song from Icon, \\"Shang-a-lang\\", sampled the end of the speech.\\r\\nIn 1992, the band Moodswings, incorporated excerpts from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in their song \\"Spiritual High, Part III. on the album Moodfood\\".\\r\\nIn 2002, the Library of Congress honored the speech by adding it to the United States National Recording Registry.[51] In 2003, the National Park Service dedicated an inscribed marble pedestal to commemorate the location of King's speech at the Lincoln Memorial.[52]\\r\\nThe Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial was dedicated in 2011. The centerpiece for the memorial is based on a line from King's \\"I Have A Dream\\" speech: \\"Out of a mountain of despair, a stone of hope.\\"[53] A 30 feet (9.1?m)-high relief of King named the \\"Stone of Hope\\" stands past two other pieces of granite that symbolize the \\"mountain of despair.\\"[53]\\r\\nOn August 26, 2013, UK's BBC Radio 4 broadcast \\"God's Trombone\\", in which Gary Younge looked behind the scenes of the speech and explored \\"what made it both timely and timeless\\".[54]\\r\\nOn August 28, 2013, thousands gathered on the mall in Washington D.C. where King made his historic speech to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the occasion. In attendance were former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and incumbent President Barack Obama, who addressed the crowd and spoke on the significance of the event. Many of King's family were in attendance.[55]\\r\\nOn October 11, 2015, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published an exclusive report about Stone Mountain officials considering installation of a new \\"Freedom Bell\\" honoring King and citing the speech's reference to the mountain \\"Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.\\"[56] Design details and a timeline for its installation remain to be determined. The article mentioned inspiration for the proposed monument came from a bell-ringing ceremony held in 2013 in celebration of the 50th anniversary of King's speech.\\r\\nOn April 20, 2016, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced that the U.S. $5 bill, which has featured the Lincoln Memorial on its back, would undergo a redesign prior to 2020. Lew said that a portrait of Lincoln would remain on the front of the bill, but the back would be redesigned to depict various historical events that have occurred at the memorial, including an image from King's speech.[57]\\r\\nIn October 2016 Science Friday in a segment on its crowd sourced update to the Voyager Golden Record included the speech.[58]\\r\\nBecause King's speech was broadcast to a large radio and television audience, there was controversy about its copyright status. If the performance of the speech constituted \\"general publication\\", it would have entered the public domain due to King's failure to register the speech with the Register of Copyrights. However, if the performance only constituted \\"limited publication\\", King retained common law copyright. This led to a lawsuit, Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. v. CBS, Inc., which established that the King estate does hold copyright over the speech and had standing to sue; the parties then settled. Unlicensed use of the speech or a part of it can still be lawful in some circumstances, especially in jurisdictions under doctrines such as fair use or fair dealing. Under the applicable copyright laws, the speech will remain under copyright in the United States until 70 years after King's death, therefore until 2038.[59]\\r\\nAs King waved goodbye to the audience, he handed George Raveling the original typewritten \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech.[60] Raveling, an All-American Villanova Wildcats college basketball player, had volunteered as a security guard for the event and was on the podium with King at that moment.[61] Raveling still has custody of the original copy and has been offered as high as $3,000,000 for it, but claims to have no intention of selling it.[62][63]\\r\\nCoordinates: 385321.48N 7730.40W? / ?38.8893000N 77.0501111W? / 38.8893000; -77.0501111","input":"What song did martin luther king quote in his speech?"},{"output":"a large genus of about 4,200 species of herbs and small shrubs, belonging to the legume family Fabaceae and the subfamily Faboideae","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAstragalus is a large genus of about 4,200 species of herbs and small shrubs, belonging to the legume family Fabaceae and the subfamily Faboideae. It is the largest genus of plants in terms of described species.[1] The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Common names include milkvetch (most species), locoweed (in North America, some species)[2] and goat's-thorn (A. gummifer, A. tragacanthus). Some pale-flowered vetches are similar in appearance, but vetches are more vine-like.\\r\\n\\r\\nAstragalus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including many case-bearing moths of the genus Coleophora: C. cartilaginella, C. colutella, C. euryaula, and C. onobrychiella feed exclusively on Astragalus, C. astragalella and C. gallipennella feed exclusively on the species Astragalus glycyphyllos, and C. hippodromica is limited to Astragalus gombo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe natural gum tragacanth is made from several species of Astragalus occurring in the Middle East, including A. adscendens, A. gummifer, A. brachycalyx,[3][4] and A. tragacanthus.  Also Astragalus propinquus (syn. A. membranaceus) has a history of use as a herbal medicine used in systems of traditional Chinese medicine[5] and Persian medicine.[6] In traditional Chinese medicine A. membranaceus has been used to reinforce qi and strengthen the superficial resistance, and promote the discharge of pus and the growth of new tissue.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBiotechnology firms are working on deriving a telomerase activator from Astragalus. The chemical constituent cycloastragenol (also called TAT2) is being studied to help combat HIV, as well as infections associated with chronic diseases or aging,[8] the National Institutes of Health states: \\"The evidence for using astragalus for any health condition is limited. High-quality clinical trials (studies in people) are generally lacking. There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that astragalus, either alone or in combination with other herbs, may have potential benefits for the immune system, heart, and liver, and as an adjunctive therapy for cancer\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch at the UCLA AIDS Institute focused on the function of cycloastragenol in the aging process of immune cells, and its effects on the cells' response to viral infections. It appears to increase the production of telomerase, an enzyme that mediates the replacement of short bits of DNA known as telomeres, which play a key role in cell replication, including in cancer processes.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nExtracts of Astragalus propinquus ( syn. A. membranaceus) are marketed as life-prolonging extracts for human use. A proprietary extract of the dried root of A. membranaceus, called TA-65, \\"was associated with a significant age-reversal effect in the immune system, in that it led to declines in the percentage of senescent cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells after six to twelve months of use\\".[11] There are mixed data regarding Astragalus, its effects on telomerase, and cancer. For example, although 80% of cancer cells utilize telomerase for their proliferationa factor that might theoretically be exacerbated by Astragalusthe shortening of telomeres (resulting from such factors as stress and aging and possible contributors to malignancy), might also be mitigated by Astragalus. Thus, short telomeres result in chromosome instability, and the potential for telomere lengthening as a protection against cancer is possible.[12] Additionally, scientists recently reported that cancer cells may proliferate precisely because of the lack of differentiation occurring via damaged or shortened telomere length. They propose that \\"forced\\" elongation of telomeres promotes the differentiation of cancer cells, probably reducing malignancy, which is strongly associated with a loss of cell differentiation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAstragalus may interact with medications that suppress the immune system, such as cyclophosphamide.[9] It may also affect blood sugar levels and blood pressure.[9] Some Astragalus species can be toxic. For example, several species native to North America contain the alkaloid swainsonine, which may cause \\"locoism\\" in livestock.[9] The toxicity of Astragalus taxa varies.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral species, including A. alpinus (bluish-purple flowers), A. hypoglottis (purple flowers), and A. lotoides, are grown as ornamental plants in gardens.","input":"What is a s t r a g a l u s?"},{"output":"September 1958","context":"","input":"When were credit cards introduced in the us?"},{"output":"within the Valparaso Region","context":"Nickname(s): Ciudad Jardn (Garden City)\\r\\nVi?a del Mar (Spanish pronunciation:?[?bi?a eel ma?] meaning \\"Vineyard of the Sea\\"), is a city and commune on central Chile's Pacific coast.

It was Jos Francisco Vergara who instigated the idea of the creation of a new city independent of Valparaso.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe establishment of Refinadora de Az~car de Vi?a del Mar (Sugar Refining Company), CRAV in 1873 and the arrival of the British company of Lever & Murphy in 1883 gave the necessary economic push to transform the young city into one of the most important cities of Chile. The building of a military installation, Regimiento Coraceros in 1917, naval facilities in Las Salinas, and the housing of military and naval personnel furthered the city's growth. That year, also, a seaside villa was rebuilt as what is known today as Wulff Castle.[6]\\r\\nIn 1925, the Teatro Municipal was opened in its current location in the eastern front of the city's downtown square, Plaza de Vi?a del Mar. In 1928 president Carlos Ib?ez del Campo authorized the creation of a casino, securing the future and the touristy character of the city. The Casino Municipal de Vi?a del Mar was opened on December 31, 1930.[7] On January 31, 1931, the Presidential Palace was inaugurated in Cerro Castillo (Castle Hill) as a summer residence for the Chilean President. The touristy character of the city was furthered with the inauguration of the O'Higgins Hotel in 1936 and the inauguration of the Miramar Hotel by Caleta Abarca Beach in 1945. For a few years in the early 1960s, a trolleybus line connected the city with Valparaso, and the electric route network included three branches within Vi?a.[8]\\r\\nVi?a del Mar was one of the four host cities of the 1962 football (soccer) World Cup.

Unemployment rose to alarmingly high rates. Many factories started to consolidate their operations in Santiago making the situation even worse. The city has failed to fully recover from the blows inflicted by the economic downturn of 1982, but an increase in the number of international tourists visiting the city, and the recent high prices of copper in world markets have promoted an economic recovery.[citation needed]\\r\\nExtensive commercial redevelopment in the 15 Norte Avenue area, previously an abandoned industrial area, has seen most of the large Chilean retail chains settling in the area, which is now covered with large shopping malls, like Marina Arauco, cinemas, fast food stores, and supermarkets.\\r\\nThe city has benefitted from major investments in infrastructure that have greatly improved the traffic flow in the downtown area,[citation needed] especially in routes connecting Vi?a del Mar with Santiago, Valparaso and Quilpu.

During the Civil War, the property changed hands between forces of the Confederate States Army and the Union Army, who almost burned the resort to the ground.\\r\\nFollowing the Civil War, the resort reopened. It became a place for many Southerners and Northerners alike to vacation. It was the setting for some notable post-war reconciliations. The \\"White Sulphur Manifesto\\",[14] the only political paper published by Confederate General Robert E. Lee after the Civil War, advocated the merging of the two societies. The resort became a center of regional post-war society, especially after the arrival of the railroad. Beginning in 1869, it provided direct service to the resort's gates.\\r\\nIn 1910, the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway purchased the resort property, building additional amenities, including the current bath wing, which opened in 1911. The C&O's improvements culminated with the construction of a colossal six-story, 250-room hotel building, which forms the central wing of today's hotel. Designed by British-born American architect Frederick Julius Sterner, it opened on September 25, 1913. At this time, what had for decades been a summer establishment was converted to a year-round resort, and the name was officially changed to The Greenbrier, after the neighboring county. The neighboring town had incorporated in 1909 and adopted the name White Sulphur Springs, which the resort had previously used. The railroad also introduced the game of golf, which became a defining feature of the resort. The first small course was opened in 1910, and a full 18-hole course, designed by Charles B. Macdonald, opened at The Greenbrier in 1913. That original course is today known as \\"The Old White TPC\\". The historic Old White Hotel structure was demolished in 1922 because it failed to meet then-current fire codes. In 1931, completion of the north wing, crossing the original 1913 wing like a \\"T\\", nearly doubled the size of the hotel.\\r\\nJust after the United States entered World War II, the resort was called on December 17, 1941, to serve as a relocation center for Axis diplomats who were in the United States and had been interned as enemies of the United States. The first detainees were Germans; later, they were joined by Japanese diplomats previously interned at The Homestead in Hot Springs, Virginia. The hotel served as a diplomatic detention center until July 8, 1942.[15]\\r\\nThe hotel briefly reopened for the 1942 season, but was soon commandeered by the U.S. Army for use as a hospital. The Army paid $3.3 million for the property, which had been valued at $5.4 million, and took over control of the property on September 1, 1942. They converted the resort to a 2000-bed hospital, known as Ashford General Hospital, named for Bailey Ashford, a noted Army doctor. The hospital opened on October 16, 1943. The hospital treated nearly 25,000 patients before closing on June 30, 1946. The property was sold back to the C&O railroad for just under the $3.3 million they had been paid in 1942.\\r\\nC&O hired internationally renowned interior designer Dorothy Draper to completely redecorate and restore The Greenbrier. Draper oversaw every element of the design of the property in her trademark style: combining bold colors, classical influences and modern touches, and the work took two years. The Greenbrier's reopening, celebrated from April 15 to April 18, 1948, was an international social event of the season. It attracted such luminaries as the Duke of Windsor and his wife, Wallis Simpson (who had spent her honeymoon with her first husband at The Greenbrier in 1916), Bing Crosby, and members of the Joseph Kennedy family. Since the late 20th century, the resort has hosted several presidents and vice-presidents, in addition to foreign dignitaries such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, and Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco.\\r\\nIn the late 1950s, the U.S. government approached The Greenbrier for assistance in creating a secret emergency relocation center to house Congress in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. The classified, underground facility, named \\"Project Greek Island\\",[11][16] was built at the same time as the West Virginia Wing, an above-ground addition to the hotel, from 1959 to 1962.[9][10]\\r\\nAlthough the bunker was kept stocked with supplies for 30 years, it was never used as an emergency location, even during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The existence of the bunker was not acknowledged by the government; Ted Gup of The Washington Post reported it in a 1992 story.[6][7][8] Immediately after publication of the Post story, the government decommissioned the bunker. The facility has since been renovated. It is also used as a data storage facility for the private sector. It is featured as an attraction in which visitors can tour the now declassified facilities, known as The Bunker.\\r\\nOn March 20, 2009, the resort filed for bankruptcy, listing debt of up to $500 million and assets of $100 million. It had suffered from competition from a wide variety of resorts, and declining traffic since the postwar period as patrons shifted to destinations they could reach by automobile. The resort lost $166 million in 2008. Pending court and regulatory approval, the resort was to be sold to the Marriott hotel chain (which has operated it), contingent upon significant concessions from the unions and approval of $50 million in financing from CSX.\\r\\nOn May 7, 2009, the Justice family of West Virginia publicly claimed that it had purchased the resort for $20?million. The Justice family, headed by patriarch Jim Justice, the current Governor of West Virginia, has extensive farm and milling operations in West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. It farms 50,000 acres (200?km2) through its Justice Family Farms group, headquartered in Beckley, West Virginia. In early 2009, it sold its Bluestone Coal Corporation network of West Virginia coal mines to Mechel.[17]\\r\\nThe Marriott Corporation asserted that it had a valid contract to purchase the hotel, and expected to see that contract honored. However, Justice ultimately settled with Marriott. The bankruptcy judge dismissed the case on May 19, 2009, clearing the way for Justice's purchase of the property.[18][19][20]\\r\\nThe resort was closed briefly after the 2016 West Virginia flood; however, flood victims who needed a place to stay were offered rooms in the hotel.[21] The hotel reopened on July 12, 2016, with several amenities, including an off-road Jeep trail, several walking trails, and the falconry operation, which had been closed for the year.\\r\\nIn November 2008, county voters narrowly approved a local option referendum that would permit casino-style gambling at the hotel. The rules, regulations, and tax rates were signed into law on May 8, 2009. The Justice family promised that gambling facilities at the resort would be \\"tasteful\\" if established.[22] The temporary casino, named \\"The Tavern Casino\\", opened on October 1, 2009. The permanent casino, The Casino Club at The Greenbrier opened on July 2, 2010 with a celebrity gala.\\r\\nUnder the state's regulations, only \\"guests\\" of the Greenbrier may visit the casino. The hotel and state regulators have differed over the definition of \\"guest\\", as the casino allows persons taking a tour or dining at the resort to visit, without being registered to stay overnight in the hotel.[citation needed] In 2013, the casino added simulcast horse racing and associated betting to its offerings.\\r\\nTwenty-six presidents have been hosted at The Greenbrier.[23] The Presidents' Cottage Museum is a two-story building with exhibits about these visits and the history of The Greenbrier. The building is open seasonally.\\r\\nThe resort has a significant place in golf history. The original nine holes were designed by Alexander H. Findlay. For the last years of his life, golf legend Sam Snead held the position of the resort's pro emeritus. In the 21st century, that title has been held by Tom Watson; the golf pro emeritus is currently Lee Trevino.[24]\\r\\nThe Greenbrier was the site of the Ryder Cup in 1979, the first to be contested under the format of United States against Europe, which has been continued to the present. It hosted the Solheim Cup in 1994, the women's equivalent to the Ryder Cup. The Greenbrier is the first of three locations to host both the men's and women's United States versus Europe team competitions, the Ryder and Solheim cups; it was joined in 1998 by Muirfield Village in Dublin, Ohio, with Scotland's Gleneagles Hotel PGA Centenary Course, the host of the 2014 Ryder Cup, joining when it hosts the 2019 Solheim Cup.\\r\\nThe Greenbrier American Express Championship on the Senior PGA Tour (now the PGA Tour Champions) was held from 1985 through 1987.[25][26]\\r\\nThe PGA Tour came to the hotel in 2010 with the Greenbrier Classic. After two years of being held on the last weekend of July, the tournament obtained the more favorable date of the first weekend in July, starting in 2012. On March 28, 2011, The Old White Course became a TPC course.[27] The 2016 event was canceled due to severe flooding in June.\\r\\nAll four of the golf courses on the property, the Old White TPC, the Greenbrier Course, the Meadows Course, and the Snead Course were damaged in the 2016 flood. On July 12, 2016, a modified course, made up mostly of the Greenbrier Course but also parts of the Meadows Course, was laid out and opened for play that year. The remaining courses were closed for the year.\\r\\nThe Greenbrier Clinic, adjacent to the hotel, has operated as an executive health facility since 1948. In 1971 it began operating independently from the hotel (although still leasing its facility from The Greenbrier).[28]\\r\\nIn 2011, Justice announced an ambitious plan to construct the Greenbrier Medical Institute, a large-scale medical facility with a projected cost of at least $250 million, planned to be built in five stages. It was to include a sports medicine facility to be headed by orthopedic surgeon James Andrews.[29] Construction of the first stage began in May 2012.[30]\\r\\nThe project was intended to establish relationships with professional sports teams, as the resort wanted to attract a National Football League team that would hold its annual training camp at The Greenbrier. In March 2014, the New Orleans Saints and the hotel reached agreement on a three-year deal. The hotel committed to build three football fields and other facilities for the Saints, at an estimated cost of $20ÿ25 million, adjacent to the medical facilities. The project was to be partially subsidized by tax breaks recently approved by the state legislature, with an estimated value of $25 million over 10 years.\\r\\nThe relationship between the hotel and the Saints reportedly developed after a visit by Saints head coach Sean Payton to the 2013 Greenbrier Classic golf tournament to play in its pro-am competition and then to serve as caddie for his friend, PGA Tour player Ryan Palmer.[31] After three seasons (during which the Saints praised the Greenbrier's facilities but finished with a 7-9 record every year), the Saints did not renew their contract with the hotel. The Houston Texans took over the facilities for their 2017 training camp.[32]\\r\\nThe Spring League, a minor league football organization, held six of the seven games in their inaugural season at The Greenbrier.[33]\\r\\nThe sprawling resort complex, surrounded by mountains on the resort's 11,000-acre property\\r\\nNorth entrance in 2008\\r\\nThe back patio in 2006\\r\\nThe historic Springhouse\\r\\nRobert E.

It is the largest cemetery for Commonwealth forces in the world, for any war. The cemetery and its surrounding memorial are located outside of Passchendale, near Zonnebeke in Belgium.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"Tyne Cot\\" is said to come from the Northumberland Fusiliers, seeing a resemblance between the many German concrete pill boxes on this site and typical Tyneside workers' cottages (Tyne cots).[2] Tyne Cot CWGC Cemetery lies on a broad rise in the landscape which overlooks the surrounding countryside. As such, the location was strategically important to both sides fighting in the area. The concrete shelters which still stand in various parts of the cemetery were part of a fortified position of the German Flandern I Stellung,[3] which played an important role in the area during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917.\\r\\nOn 4 October 1917, the area where Tyne Cot CWGC Cemetery is now located was captured by the 3rd Australian Division and the New Zealand Division and two days later a cemetery for British and Canadian war dead was begun. The cemetery was recaptured by German forces on 13 April 1918 and was finally liberated by Belgian forces on 28 September.[4]\\r\\nAfter the Armistice in November 1918, the cemetery was greatly enlarged from its original 343 graves[4] by concentrating graves from the battlefields, smaller cemeteries nearby and from Langemark.[1]\\r\\nThe cemetery grounds were assigned to the United Kingdom in perpetuity by King Albert I of Belgium in recognition of the sacrifices made by the British Empire in the defence and liberation of Belgium during the war.\\r\\nThe Cross of Sacrifice that marks many CWGC cemeteries was built on top of a German pill box in the centre of the cemetery, purportedly at the suggestion of King George V, who visited the cemetery in 1922 as it neared completion.[1] The King's visit, described in the poem The King's Pilgrimage, included a speech in which he said:\\r\\nWe can truly say that the whole circuit of the Earth is girdled with the graves of our dead. In the course of my pilgrimage, I have many times asked myself whether there can be more potent advocates of peace upon Earth through the years to come, than this massed multitude of silent witnesses to the desolation of war.\\r\\nThe cemetery was designed by Sir Herbert Baker. The land on which the cemetery stands is the free gift in perpetuity of the Belgian people to those who are honoured here.[6]\\r\\nThe cemetery has several notable graves and memorials, including the grave of Private James Peter Robertson (1883ÿ1917), a Canadian awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery in rushing a machine gun emplacement and rescuing two men from under heavy fire. He was killed saving the second of these men on 6 November 1917.[1]\\r\\nTwo Australian recipients of the Victoria Cross buried in the cemetery are Captain Clarence Smith Jeffries (1894ÿ1917), and Sergeant Lewis McGee (1888ÿ1917). Jeffries led an assault party and rushed one of the strong points at the First Battle of Passchendaele on 12 October 1917, capturing four machine guns and thirty five prisoners, before running his company forward again. He was planning another attack when he was killed by an enemy gunner. On the same day, McGee, who had earned his decoration eight days earlier at Broodseinde, was killed charging an enemy pillbox in the same battle.\\r\\nAlso at Tyne Cot, behind the Cross of Sacrifice which was constructed on top of an old German pillbox in the middle of the cemetery, there are 4 German graves, buried alongside Commonwealth graves. These graves are of men that were treated here after the battle, when the pillbox underneath the main cross was used as a Dressing Station for wounded men.\\r\\nThe stone wall surrounding the cemetery makes-up the Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing, one of several Commonwealth War Graves Commission Memorials to the Missing along the Western Front. The UK missing lost in the Ypres Salient are commemorated at the Menin Gate memorial to the missing in Ypres and the Tyne Cot Memorial. Upon completion of the Menin Gate, builders discovered it was not large enough to contain all the names as originally planned.[7] They selected an arbitrary cut-off date of 15 August 1917 and the names of the UK missing after this date were inscribed on the Tyne Cot memorial instead.[8] Additionally, the New Zealand contingent of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission declined to have its missing soldiers names listed on the main memorials, choosing instead to have names listed near the appropriate battles. Tyne Cot was chosen as one of these locations.[9] Unlike the other New Zealand memorials to its missing, the Tyne Cot New Zealand memorial to the missing is integrated within the larger Tyne Cot memorial, forming a central apse in the main memorial wall. The inscription reads: \\"Here are recorded the names of officers and men of New Zealand who fell in the Battle of Broodseinde and the First Battle of Passchendaele October 1917 and whose graves are known only unto God\\".[10]\\r\\nThe memorial contains the names of 33,783 soldiers of the UK forces, plus a further 1,176 New Zealanders.[11] Three British Army Victoria Cross recipients are commemorated here:[12]\\r\\nOther notable persons commemorated include:\\r\\nIt was designed by Sir Herbert Baker, with sculptures by Joseph Armitage and Ferdinand Victor Blundstone, who also sculpted part of the Newfoundland National War Memorial.[14]\\r\\nThe memorial was unveiled on 20 June 1927 by Sir Gilbert Dyett.[14]\\r\\nGraves at Tyne Cot Cemetery\\r\\nView towards entrance of cemetery\\r\\nTyne Cot Cemetery with \\"Cross of Sacrifice\\" on the far right\\r\\nTyne Cot \\"Cross of Sacrifice\\"\\r\\nA single marker for two of the four German graves at Tyne Cot.

She wrote the screenplay for the film version of Postcards From The Edge which garnered her a BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nomination, and her one-woman stage show of Wishful Drinking was filmed for television and received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special. She worked on other writers' screenplays as a script doctor; including tightening the scripts for Hook (1991), Sister Act (1992), The Wedding Singer (1998), and many of the films from the Star Wars franchise, among others.[5] In later years, she earned praise for speaking publicly about her experiences with bipolar disorder and drug addiction.[6]\\r\\nFisher was the daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds. She and her mother appear in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, a documentary about their relationship. It premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Fisher died of sudden cardiac death on December 27, 2016, at age 60, four days after experiencing a medical emergency during a transatlantic flight from London to Los Angeles. Her final film, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, was released on December 15, 2017 and is dedicated to her.[7][8]\\r\\nCarrie Frances Fisher[9] was born on October 21, 1956, in Burbank, California,[10] to actors and singers Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.[11] Fisher's paternal grandparents were Jewish Russian immigrants, while her mother, who was raised a Nazarene, was of Scots-Irish and English descent.[12][13][14][15]\\r\\nFisher was two years old when her parents divorced in 1959. Her father's third marriage, to actress Connie Stevens, resulted in the births of Fisher's two half-sisters, Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher. In 1960, her mother married Harry Karl, owner of a chain of shoe stores. Reynolds and Karl divorced in 1973, when Fisher was 17 years old.[16]\\r\\nFisher \\"hid in books\\" as a child, becoming known in her family as \\"the bookworm\\".[17] She spent her earliest years reading classic literature, and writing poetry. She attended Beverly Hills High School until age 15, when she appeared as a debutante and singer in the hit Broadway revival Irene (1973), starring her mother.[18] Her time on Broadway interfered with her education, resulting in Fisher's dropping out of high school.[19] In 1973, Fisher enrolled at London's Central School of Speech and Drama, which she attended for 18 months.[17][20] Following her time there, Fisher applied to and was accepted at Sarah Lawrence College, where she planned to study the arts. She later left without graduating.[21][22][23]\\r\\nFisher made her film debut at age 18 as the precociously seductive character Lorna Karpf in the Columbia Pictures comedy Shampoo (1975). Lee Grant and Jack Warden play the role of her parents in the film. Warren Beatty, Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn also star in the film.[3] In 1977, Fisher starred as Princess Leia in George Lucas' science-fiction film Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV ÿ A New Hope) opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford.[25] At the time, she believed the script for Star Wars was fantastic, but did not expect many people to agree with her. Though her fellow actors were not close at the time, they bonded after the commercial success of the film.[26]\\r\\nIn April 1978, Fisher appeared as the love interest in Ringo Starr's 1978 TV special Ringo.[27] The next month, she starred alongside John Ritter (who had also appeared in Ringo) in the ABC-TV film Leave Yesterday Behind.[28] At this time, Fisher appeared with Laurence Olivier and Joanne Woodward in the anthology series Laurence Olivier Presents in a television version of the William Inge play Come Back, Little Sheba.[29] That November, she played Princess Leia in the 1978 TV production Star Wars Holiday Special, and sang in the last scene.[30]\\r\\nFisher appeared in the film The Blues Brothers as Jake's vengeful ex-lover; she is listed in the credits as \\"Mystery Woman\\".[31] While Fisher was in Chicago filming the movie, she choked on a Brussels sprout; Dan Aykroyd performed the Heimlich maneuver and \\"saved my life\\".[32] She appeared on Broadway in Censored Scenes from King Kong in 1980. The same year, she reprised her role as Princess Leia in The Empire Strikes Back, and appeared with her Star Wars co-stars on the cover of the July 12, 1980 issue of Rolling Stone to promote the film.[33] She also starred as Sister Agnes in the Broadway production of Agnes of God in 1982.[34]\\r\\nIn 1983, Fisher returned to the role of Princess Leia in Return of the Jedi, and posed in the character's metal bikini on the cover of the Summer 1983 issue of Rolling Stone to promote the film.[35][36] The costume later achieved a following of its own.[37] In 1986 she starred along with Barbara Hershey and Mia Farrow in Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters.\\r\\nIn 1987, Fisher published her first novel, Postcards from the Edge. The book was semi-autobiographical in the sense that she fictionalized and satirized real-life events such as her drug addiction of the late 1970s and her relationship with her mother. It became a bestseller, and she received the Los Angeles Pen Award for Best First Novel. Also during 1987, she was in the Australian film The Time Guardian. In 1989 Fisher played a major supporting role in When Harry Met Sally..., and in the same year she appeared with Tom Hanks as his character's wife in The 'Burbs.[3]\\r\\nIn 1990, Columbia Pictures released a film version of Postcards from the Edge, adapted for the screen by Fisher and starring Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine and Dennis Quaid.[38] Fisher appeared in the fantasy comedy film Drop Dead Fred in 1991, and played a therapist in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997).[3] During the 1990s, Fisher also published the novels Surrender the Pink (1990) and Delusions of Grandma (1993). Fisher wrote an episode of the television sitcom Roseanne entitled \\"Arsenic and Old Mom\\", in which her mother Debbie Reynolds made a guest appearance.[39] Fisher also did uncredited script work for movies such as Lethal Weapon 3 (where she wrote some of Rene Russo's dialogue), Outbreak (also starring Russo), The Wedding Singer[40] and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot.[41]\\r\\nIn the 2000 film Scream 3, Fisher played a former actress,[42] and in 2001 she played a nun in the Kevin Smith comedy Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. She also co-wrote the TV comedy film These Old Broads (2001), of which she was also co-executive producer. It starred her mother Debbie Reynolds, as well as Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins and Shirley MacLaine.[43]\\r\\nIn addition to acting and writing original works, Fisher was one of the top script doctors in Hollywood, working on the screenplays of other writers.[44][45] She did uncredited polishes on movies in a 15-year stretch from 1991 to 2005. She was hired by George Lucas to polish scripts for his 1992 TV series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and the dialogue for the Star Wars prequel scripts.[44] Her expertise in this area was the reason she was chosen as one of the interviewers for the screenwriting documentary Dreams on Spec in 2007. In an interview in 2004, Fisher said she no longer did much script doctoring.[45]\\r\\nIn 2005, Women in Film & Video ÿ DC recognized Fisher with the Women of Vision Award.[46]\\r\\nFisher also voiced Peter Griffin's boss, Angela, on the animated sitcom Family Guy[47] and wrote the introduction for a book of photographs titled Hollywood Moms, which was published in 2001.[48] Fisher published a sequel to Postcards, The Best Awful There Is, in 2004.\\r\\nFisher wrote and performed in her one-woman play Wishful Drinking at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles from November 2006 to January 2007.[49] Her show then played throughout 2008 at the Berkeley Repertory Theater,[50] San Jose, the Hartford Stage,[51] the Arena Stage[52] and Boston.[53] Fisher published her autobiographical book, also titled Wishful Drinking, based on her successful play in December 2008 and embarked on a media tour. In 2009, Fisher returned to the stage with her play at the Seattle Repertory Theatre.[54] Wishful Drinking then opened on Broadway in New York at Studio 54 and played an extended run from October 2009 until January 2010.[55][56] In December 2009, Fisher's audiobook recording of Wishful Drinking earned her a nomination for a 2009 Grammy Award in the Best Spoken Word Album category.[57]\\r\\nFisher joined Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne on Saturday evenings in 2007 for The Essentials with informative and entertaining conversation on Hollywood's best films. She guest-starred in the episode titled \\"Sex and Another City\\" from season 3 of Sex and the City with Sarah Jessica Parker. On October 25, 2007, Fisher guest-starred as Rosemary Howard on the second-season episode of 30 Rock called \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", for which she received an Emmy Award nomination.[58] On April 28, 2008, she was a guest on Deal or No Deal.[59] In 2008, she also had a cameo as a doctor in the Star Wars-related comedy Fanboys.\\r\\nIn 2010, HBO aired a feature-length documentary based on a special live performance of Fisher's Wishful Drinking stage production.[60] At the time of her death, Fisher had been preparing a sequel to the one-woman play.[61]\\r\\nFisher appeared on the seventh season of Entourage in the summer of 2010.[60] She was among the featured performers at the Comedy Central Roast of Roseanne, which aired in August 2012. In her monologue, Fisher poked fun at her own mental illness,[62] and her fellow roasters' reliance on weight and menopause jokes.[63] Fisher joked that she had no idea why she was asked to roast Roseanne, until \\"they explained that we were actually good friends, and that apparently we have worked together.\\"[64] Host Jane Lynch joked that Fisher was there to add perspective to Roseanne's struggles with weight and drugs. Fellow roaster Wayne Brady poked fun at Fisher's career, saying she was the only celebrity \\"whose action figure is worth more than you are.\\"[65]\\r\\nShe was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Venice Film Festival.[66] She filmed an appearance on the UK comedy panel show QI that was broadcast on December 25, 2014.[67] Fisher starred alongside Sharon Horgan and comedian Rob Delaney in the British comedy series Catastrophe, that was first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on January 19, 2015.[68][69] Her last appearance on Catastrophe, which aired in the UK on April 4, 2017, left many viewers in tears[70] and earned her a posthumous Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series nomination.\\r\\nIn a March 2013 interview following the announcement that a new trilogy of films would be produced, Fisher confirmed that she would reprise her role as Princess Leia in Episode VII of the Star Wars series. Fisher claimed that Leia was \\"Elderly. She's in an intergalactic old folks' home [laughs]. I just think she would be just like she was before, only slower and less inclined to be up for the big battle.\\"[71] After other media outlets reported this on March 6, 2013, her representative said the same day that Fisher was joking and that nothing was announced.[72]\\r\\nIn a January 2014 interview, Fisher confirmed her involvement and the involvement of the original cast in the upcoming sequels by saying \\"as for the next Star Wars film, myself, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill are expected to report to work in March or April. I'd like to wear my old cinnamon buns hairstyle again but with white hair. I think that would be funny.\\"[73]\\r\\nIn March 2014, Fisher stated that she was moving to London for six months because that was where Star Wars Episode VII filming would take place.[74] On April 29, 2014, the cast for the new sequel was officially announced, and Fisher, along with Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels, and Kenny Baker, were all cast in their original roles for the film. Star Wars Episode VII, subtitled The Force Awakens, was released worldwide on December 18, 2015. Fisher was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal.[75]\\r\\nIn Rogue One (2016), which predates the original trilogy, a young version of Leia and the character Grand Moff Tarkin appear, both through computer animation.[76][77] Fisher had completed filming her role as Leia in Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) shortly before her death.[78] Variety reported following her death that Fisher was slated to appear in Episode IX and that now Lucasfilm, Disney, and others involved with the film will need to find a way to address her death and what will become of her character.[79][80][81]\\r\\nFisher's memoir, The Princess Diarist, was released in November 2016. The book is based on diaries she kept while filming the original Star Wars trilogy in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[82][83] Her audiobook recording of the memoir earned her the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album, awarded 13 months after her death.\\r\\nFisher and her mother appear in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,[84] a 2016 documentary about their close relationship featuring interviews, photographs and home movies. The documentary premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and broadcast on January 7, 2017.[85]\\r\\nShe will be featured in the film Wonderwell with Rita Ora, which was filmed in the summer of 2016 in Italy.[86]\\r\\nFisher met musician Paul Simon while filming Star Wars, and the pair dated from 1977 until 1983.[87] In 1980, she was briefly engaged to Canadian actor and comedian Dan Aykroyd, who proposed to her on the set of their film The Blues Brothers. She said: \\"We had rings, we got blood tests, the whole shot. But then I got back together with Paul Simon.\\"[88] Fisher was married to Simon from August 1983 to July 1984, and they dated again for a time after their divorce.[citation needed] During their marriage, she appeared in Simon's music video for the song \\"Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog after the War\\". Simon's song \\"Hearts and Bones\\" is about their romance.[89][90]\\r\\nShe subsequently had a relationship with Creative Artists Agency principal and talent agent Bryan Lourd. They had one child together, Billie Lourd (b. 1992). Eddie Fisher stated in his autobiography (Been There Done That) that his granddaughter's name is Catherine Fisher Lourd and her nickname is \\"Billy\\". The couple's relationship ended when Lourd left to be in a homosexual relationship. In interviews, Fisher described Lourd as her second husband, but a 2004 profile of the actress and writer revealed that she and Lourd were never legally married.[91]\\r\\nIn her 2016 autobiography The Princess Diarist, Fisher wrote that she and Harrison Ford had a three-month affair during the filming of Star Wars in 1976.[92]\\r\\nFisher also had a close relationship with singer James Blunt. While working on his album Back to Bedlam in 2003, Blunt spent much of his time at Fisher's residence. When Vanity Fair's George Wayne asked Fisher if their relationship was sexual, she replied: \\"Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff. Every time James hears fireworks or anything like that, his heart beats faster, and he gets 'fight or flight.' You know, he comes from a long line of soldiers dating back to the 10th century. He would tell me these horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became James' therapist. So it would have been unethical to sleep with my patient.\\"[25]\\r\\nOn February 26, 2005, R. Gregory \\"Greg\\" Stevens, a lobbyist, was found dead in Fisher's California home. The final autopsy report listed the cause of death as \\"cocaine and oxycodone use\\" but added chronic, and apparently previously undiagnosed, heart disease as contributing factors. Media coverage of an initial autopsy report used the word \\"overdose,\\" but that wording is not in the final report.[93] In an interview, Fisher claimed that Stevens' ghost haunted her mansion, which unsettled her: \\"I was a nut for a year\\", she explained, \\"and in that year I took drugs again.\\"[25]\\r\\nFisher described herself as an \\"enthusiastic agnostic who would be happy to be shown that there is a God\\".[94] She was raised Protestant,[95] but often attended Jewish services (her father's faith) with Orthodox friends.[96]\\r\\nIn 2016, Harvard College gave Fisher its Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism, noting that \\"her forthright activism and outspokenness about addiction, mental illness, and agnosticism have advanced public discourse on these issues with creativity and empathy.\\"[6]\\r\\nFisher was a supporter and advocate for several causes, including women's advocacy,[97] animal rights,[98] and LGBT causes.[99] She was open about her experiences caring for friends who suffered from AIDS, contributing financially to various AIDS and HIV organizations, including hosting a benefit for amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.[100] She also served as an honorary board member for the International Bipolar Foundation,[101] and, in 2014, received the Golden Heart Award for her work with The Midnight Mission.[102]\\r\\nShe was a spokesperson for Jenny Craig weight loss television ads that aired in January 2011.[103]\\r\\nDuring appearances on 20/20 and The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive with Stephen Fry, Fisher publicly discussed her diagnosis of bipolar disorder and her addictions to cocaine and prescription medication.[104] She said her drug use was a form of self-medication; she used pain medication such as Percodan to \\"dial down\\" the manic aspect of her bipolar disorder.[105] She gave nicknames to her bipolar moods: Roy (\\"the wild ride of a mood\\") and Pam (\\"who stands on the shore and sobs\\").[106] \\"Drugs made me feel more normal\\", she explained to Psychology Today in 2001. \\"They contained me.\\"[105] She discussed her 2008 memoir Wishful Drinking and various topics in it with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today that same year, and also revealed that she would have turned down the role of Princess Leia had she realized it would give her the celebrity status that made her parents' lives difficult.[107] This interview was followed by a similar appearance on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on December 12, 2008, where she discussed her electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments.[108] At one point, she received ECT every six weeks to \\"blow apart the cement\\" in her brain.[109] In 2014, she said she was no longer receiving the treatment.[110]\\r\\nIn another interview, Fisher revealed that she used cocaine during the filming of The Empire Strikes Back. \\"Slowly, I realized I was doing a bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter\\", she noted.[111][112] In 1985, after months of sobriety, she accidentally overdosed on a combination of prescription medication and sleeping pills.[113] She was rushed to the hospital, creating the turn of events that led to much of the material in her novel and screenplay, Postcards from the Edge. Asked why she did not take on the role of her story's protagonist, named Suzanne, in the film version, Fisher remarked, \\"I've already played Suzanne.\\"[114]\\r\\nIn her later years, Fisher had an emotional support animal, a French Bulldog named Gary, whom she brought to numerous appearances and interviews.[115] Following her death, reports indicated that Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd would take care of Gary.[116]\\r\\nAfter finishing the European leg of her book tour (her last TV appearance was on The Graham Norton Show recording four days before her death), Fisher was on a commercial flight on December 23, 2016, from London to Los Angeles when she suffered a medical emergency around fifteen minutes before the aircraft landed.[117][a] A passenger seated near Fisher reported that she had stopped breathing;[120] another passenger performed CPR on Fisher until paramedics arrived at the scene. Emergency services in Los Angeles were contacted when the flight crew reported a passenger in distress prior to landing. Fisher was taken by ambulance to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she was placed on a ventilator.[121][122]\\r\\nFollowing four days in intensive care at UCLA Medical Center, Fisher died on December 27, 2016, at 8:55?a.m. (PST); she was 60 years old.[123] Fisher's daughter, Billie Lourd, confirmed her mother's death in a statement to the press.[121] Many of her co-stars and directors from Star Wars and other works also shared their thoughts on her death.[124]\\r\\nOn January 9, 2017, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued a death certificate that stated \\"cardiac arrest/deferred\\" as the cause of death. More tests were expected.[125] In a June 16, 2017, news release, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said that the exact cause of death could not be determined, but sleep apnea and the buildup of fatty tissue on the walls of arteries were among the contributing factors.[126] A full report from June 19, 2017, stated that Fisher had cocaine in her system, as well as traces of heroin, other opiates, and MDMA. The report also stated that the investigation was unable to determine when she had taken the drugs, and whether they contributed to her death.[127] Her daughter Billie Lourd stated that Fisher \\"battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life [and] ultimately died of it. She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases... I know my Mom, shed want her death to encourage people to be open about their struggles.\\"[128]\\r\\nThe day after Fisher's death, her mother Debbie Reynolds suffered a stroke at the home of son Todd, where the family was planning Fisher's burial arrangements.[129] She was taken to a hospital, where she died later that afternoon.[130][131] According to Todd Fisher, Reynolds had said, \\"I want to be with Carrie\\" immediately prior to suffering the stroke.[132][133][b] On January 5, 2017, a joint private memorial was held for Fisher and Reynolds. A portion of Fisher's ashes were laid to rest beside Reynolds in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.[135] The remainder of her ashes are held in a giant, novelty Prozac pill.[136]\\r\\nIn her 2008 book, Wishful Drinking, Fisher wrote about what she hoped would eventually be her obituary: \\"I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.\\" Several obituaries and retrospectives featured the quote.[137] In the absence of a star for Fisher on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, fans created their own memorial using a blank star. Along with flowers and candles, words put on the blank star read, \\"Carrie Fisher may the force be with you always\\".[2] In the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, thousands of fans paid tribute to Fisher by gathering at House Organa on the planet Alderaan where Fisher's character in Star Wars resided.[138][139] Lightsaber vigils and similar events in Fisher's honor were held at various Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas theaters and other sites.[140][141][142] On January 6, 2017, the lights on Broadway in Manhattan were darkened for one minute in honor of Fisher and her mother.[143] Fisher and Reynolds were also both featured in the 89th Academy Awards In Memoriam segment.[144] On March 25, 2017, a public memorial for mother and daughter was held at the Hall of Liberty theater in Forest Lawn Memorial Park. The event was streamed live on Reynolds' website. On April 14, a special tribute to Fisher was held by Mark Hamill during the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.[145]\\r\\nNovels\\r\\nNon-fiction\\r\\nScreenplays\\r\\nPlays\\r\\nOther\\r\\nNomination","input":"Who was the actress who played princess leia?"},{"output":"eight","context":"","input":"How many times did red sox win world series?"},{"output":"June 29, 2007","context":"The history of iPhone began with a request from Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs to the company's engineers, asking them to investigate the use of touchscreen devices and tablet computers (which later came to fruition with the iPad).[1][2][3][4] Many have noted the device's similarities to Apple's previous touch-screen portable device, the Newton MessagePad.[5][6][7][8] Like the Newton, the iPhone is nearly all screen. Its form factor is credited to Apple's Chief Design Officer, Jonathan Ive.[3][9]\\r\\nIn April 2003, at the \\"All Things Digital\\" executive conference, Jobs expressed his belief that tablet PCs and traditional PDAs were not good choices as high-demand markets for Apple to enter, despite receiving many requests for Apple to create another PDA. He believed that cell phones were going to become important devices for portable information access, and that mobile phones needed to have excellent synchronization software. At that time, instead of focusing on a follow-up to their Newton PDA, Jobs had Apple focus on the iPod. Jobs also had Apple develop the iTunes software, which can be used to synchronize content with iPod devices. iTunes was released in January 2001.[10][11][12][13] On September 7, 2005, Apple and Motorola released the ROKR E1, the first mobile phone to use iTunes. Jobs was unhappy with the ROKR, feeling that having to compromise with a non-Apple designer (Motorola) prevented Apple from designing the phone they wanted to make.[14] In September 2006, Apple discontinued support for the ROKR, and released a version of iTunes that included references to an as-yet unknown mobile phone that could display pictures and video.[15]\\r\\nOn January 2, 2007, Steve Jobs announced iPhone at the Macworld convention, receiving substantial media attention.[16] Jobs announced that the first iPhone would be released later that year. On June 29, 2007, the first iPhone[17] was released.\\r\\nOn June 11, 2007, Apple announced at the Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference that the iPhone would support third-party applications using the Safari engine. Third parties would be able to create Web 2.0 applications, which users could access via the internet.[18] Such applications appeared even before the release of the iPhone; the first of these, called OneTrip, was a program meant to keep track of users' shopping lists.[19] On June 29, 2007, Apple released version 7.3 of iTunes to coincide with the release of iPhone.[20] This release contains support for iPhone service activation and syncing.\\r\\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the iPhone is manufactured in the Shenzhen factory of the Taiwanese company Hon Hai (also known as Foxconn).[21] Also, according to recent news, Apple will shortly begin outsourcing the manufacturing of iPhones.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Apple released the iPhone on January 9, 2007,[23] it was sold only with AT&T (formerly Cingular) contracts in the United States.[14] After 18 months of negotiations, Steve Jobs reached an agreement with the wireless division of AT&T to be the iPhone's exclusive carrier. Consumers were unable to use any other carrier without unlocking their device.\\r\\nApple retained control of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the iPhone.[24] Since some customers were jailbreaking their iPhones to leave their network, AT&T began charging them a $175 early-termination fee for leaving before the end of their contract.[25]\\r\\nQuestions arose about the legality of Apple's arrangement after the iPhone was released.[26] Two class-action lawsuits were filed against the company in October 2007: one in Federal court and the other in state court.[27] According to the suits, Apple's exclusive agreement with AT&T violated antitrust law.[28]\\r\\nThe state-court suit, filed by the law office of Damian R. Fernandez on behalf of California resident Timothy P. Smith,[28] sought an injunction barring Apple from selling iPhones with a software lock and $200 million in damages.[29] In Smith v. Apple Inc., the plaintiffs said that Apple failed to disclose to purchasers its five-year agreement with AT&T when they bought iPhones with a two-year contract and cited the Sherman Act's prohibition of monopolies.[30]\\r\\nThe second case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiff, Paul Holman, filed a complaint against Apple and AT&T Mobility that he could not switch carriers or change SIM cards without losing iPhone improvements to which he was entitled. Holman also cited a Sherman Act violation by the defendants.[31] On July?8, 2010, the case was affirmed for class certification.[32] On December 9 the court ordered a stay on the case, awaiting the Supreme Court's decision in AT&T v. Concepcion (disputed whether the state's basic standards of fairness were met by a clause in AT&T's contract limiting complaint resolution to arbitration).[33] On April 27, 2011, the Supreme Court ruled that AT&T met the state's fairness standards.[34]\\r\\nThe first advertisement for iPhone, titled \\"Hello\\", aired during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25, 2007, on American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[35] On June 4, 2007, Apple released four advertisements announcing that iPhone would be released on June 29, 2007.\\r\\nOn July 1, 2007, it was reported that Apple paid at least US$1 million to Michael Kovatch for the iPhone.com domain name, previously owned by Kovatch since 1995.[36] The URL now redirects to Apple's iPhone page.\\r\\nOn June 28, 2007, during an address to Apple employees, Steve Jobs announced that all full-time Apple employees and those part-time employees who had been with the company for at least one year would receive a free iPhone. Employees received their phones in July after the initial demand for iPhones subsided.[37]\\r\\nInitially priced at US $499 and US $599 for the 4GB models and 8GB models respectively, the iPhone went on sale on June 29, 2007. Apple closed its stores at 2:00pm local time to prepare for the 6:00pm iPhone launch, while hundreds of customers lined up at stores nationwide.[38]\\r\\nIn the US and some other countries, iPhones could only be acquired with a credit card, preventing completely anonymous purchases of iPhones.[39][40][41] At the time, there was no way to opt out of the bundled AT&T data plan. At first, iPhones could not be added to an AT&T Business account, and any existing business account discounts could not be applied to an iPhone AT&T account. AT&T changed these restrictions in late January 2008.[42]\\r\\nThe Associated Press also reported in 2007 that some users were unable to activate their phones because, according to AT&T, \\"[a] high volume of activation requests [was] taxing the company's computer servers.\\"[43][44] On Oct 29, 2007, the Usenet newsgroup misc.phone.mobile.iphone was created.[relevant? ÿ discuss]\\r\\nEarly estimates by technology analysts estimated sales of between 250,000 and 700,000 iPhones in the first weekend alone, with strong sales continuing after the initial weekend.[45][46] As part of their quarterly earnings announcement, AT&T reported that 146,000 iPhones were activated in the first weekend. Though this figure does not include units that were purchased for resale on eBay or otherwise not activated until after the opening weekend, it is still less than most initial estimates.[47] It is also estimated that 95% of the units sold are the 8GB model.[48]\\r\\nStories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press a little more than a month after iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release.[49] The 300-page iPhone bill in a box received by iJustine on Saturday, August 11, 2007[50][51] became the subject of a viral video, posted by the following Monday, which quickly became an Internet meme.[52][53] This video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media. Ten days later, after the video had been viewed more than 3 million times on the Internet,[54] and had received international news coverage, AT&T sent iPhone users a text message outlining changes in its billing practices.[55]\\r\\nOn September 5, 2007, the 4GB model was discontinued, and the 8GB model price was cut by a third, from US $599 to US $399.[56] Those who had purchased an iPhone in the 14-day period before the September 5, 2007 announcement were eligible for a US $200 \\"price protection\\" rebate from Apple or AT&T. However, it was widely reported that some who bought between the June 29, 2007 launch and the August 22, 2007 price protection kick-in date complained that this was a larger-than-normal price drop for such a relatively short period and accused Apple of unfair pricing.[57][58]\\r\\nIn response to customer complaints, on September 6, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs wrote in an open letter to iPhone customers that everyone who purchased an iPhone at the higher price \\"and who is not receiving a rebate or other consideration\\", would receive a US$100 credit to be redeemed towards the purchase of any product sold in Apple's retail or online stores.[59]\\r\\nWith the July 11, 2008 release of the iPhone 3G, Apple and AT&T changed the US pricing model from the previous generation. Following the de facto model for mobile phone service in the United States, AT&T would subsidize a sizable portion of the upfront cost for the iPhone 3G, followed by charging moderately higher monthly fees over a minimum two-year contract.[60]\\r\\nOn January 11, 2011, Verizon announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone 4. The Verizon iPhone went on sale on February 10, 2011.[61][62][63]\\r\\nDuring Apple's official unveiling of iPhone 4S on October 4, 2011, it was announced that Sprint would begin carrying the reconfigured CDMA iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S in the US on October 14.[64][65] Cricket Wireless announced on May 31, 2012 that it would become the first prepaid carrier in the US to offer iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, beginning June 22, 2012.[66] A week later, Virgin Mobile USA became the second American prepaid carrier to offer iPhone 4 and 4S, announcing plans to release the phones on June 29, 2012.[67] Due to T-Mobile USA's inability to provide iPhone to customers raised its subscription churn rate, put the unit in an \\"unsustainable position\\", and contributed to parent Deutsche Telekom's decision to sell it to AT&T in March 2011;[clarify] T-Mobile began offering iPhone on April 12, 2013.[68]\\r\\nMedia reports emerged in early August 2013 that announced that Apple would be launching its next iPhone model on September 10, 2013, but further details were not available. Brian Barrett, Managing Editor of the Gizmodo publication, speculated that either an upgraded version of iPhone 5 or a budget version would be released.[69]\\r\\nOn November 9, 2007, the iPhone was officially launched in Europe, in the United Kingdom and Germany.[clarify] In the UK, sales go through the UK O2 unit of Telef܇nica, while in Germany, it is offered through Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile division.[clarify] As in the case of the previous launch in the US, customers lined up as much as a day in advance to obtain the much-anticipated phone.[70]\\r\\nApple occasionally produced a limited number of 4GB iPhones for German and UK markets, but they never reached end customers and were used as in-store demo units. Later[when?] most of the units were disposed of.[71]\\r\\nThe initial operating model of locking iPhone owners to one selected carrier has been controversial in Europe. In Germany, Vodafone, an operator competing with the operator that Apple had locked German iPhone sales to (Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile division), brought a legal case[clarify] claiming that the arrangement was against German law. On November 20, 2007, an interim court order resulted in sales of locked iPhones in Germany being temporarily stopped. The iPhone launch in France a few weeks later through the operator Orange faced the same legal issues. Other countries that will pose[clarify] the same problems for the business model revolving around the sale of locked iPhones include Belgium, Italy, Finland, and Brazil.\\r\\nOn December 1, 2007, Tu?mobil, the Slovenian mobile operator,[clarify] started selling \\"unlocked\\" iPhones without an official contract with Apple. The offer caused confusion between Apple Europe, local media, and local Apple representatives.[72]\\r\\nOn May 6, 2008, Telecom Italia announced that it had signed a deal with Apple to sell iPhones in Italy by the end of 2008.[73] It was estimated that it would probably be the second generation iPhone with 3G-UMTS capability.\\r\\nOn May 27, 2008, TeliaSonera released a press release stating that it would start selling iPhones in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia during 2008.[74]\\r\\nOn June 4, 2008, Movistar announced that it had signed a deal with Apple to sell iPhones in Spain beginning on July 11, 2008.[75]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2008, Estonian mobile operator EMT started selling iPhones.[76]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2008, Vodafone Greece released iPhones in the Greek market.[77]\\r\\nOn September 26, 2008, Omnitel released iPhones in Lithuania.[78]\\r\\nOn November 7, 2008, T-Mobile released iPhones in Croatia.[79]\\r\\nOn September 29, 2010, Elisa released the iPhone 4 in Finland.[80]\\r\\nSingTel (in Singapore) and Globe Telecom (in the Philippines) were the first two carriers to launch the iPhone in Southeast Asia.

On July 3, 2007, Jon Lech Johansen reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked iPhone's other features with jailbreaking. He published the software and offsets for others to use.[117] On August 14, 2007, Gizmodo reported verification of a method to bypass iPhone's SIM lock, allowing the phone to work freely with carriers other than AT&T. This method requires usage of a Turbo SIM card, costing approximately US$80; the method essentially tricks iPhone into believing that it is operating on the AT&T network, even when it is connected natively (not in roaming mode) to another carrier.[118] Australian Personal Computer later published a ten-step guide to unlocking iPhone, using the Turbo SIM method.[119]\\r\\nIn mid-August, UniquePhones announced an unlocking service for iPhone, only to retract the service the following week after receiving a phone call from a lawyer representing AT&T. On August 24, 2007, George Hotz, a 17-year-old hacker from Glen Rock, New Jersey, broke the lock that ties iPhone to AT&T's wireless network. He confirmed that he unlocked the phone and was using it on T-Mobile's network. The hack opened up a realm of possibilities for overseas customers because iPhone was only sold in the United States at the time. By unlocking it, Hotz opened up the phone to phone networks across the world. Hotz posted the hack on his blog. The process is complicated and requires both disassembling iPhone and executing software commands on a personal computer. Hotz, along with four others across the world, reportedly spent about 500 hours unlocking the phone.[120][121]\\r\\nAlso on August 24, 2007, Engadget reported, by way of photos and a video clip, that they were called by the \\"iPhoneSimFree\\" team, who offered to show Engadget a demonstration of unlocking iPhone using a software-only method.[122] Unlike Hotz's hardware hack, the code in this hack was not made available to the general public. Sales of the unlock started on September 10. These sales occurred through several resellers who were able to order \\"keys\\" from iPhoneSimFree, then pass the \\"keys\\" to customers, allowing the customers to use the software. On September 11, after one day of sales, the iPhone Dev Team announced that they had created a working \\"software unlock\\", and released it to the public for free.[123] Utilizing the existing unlock[clarify] requires some technical knowledge, although a simpler, GUI-based version was under construction. AnySim and iUnlock Reloaded, two free, GUI-based unlocking programs, have since been made available.\\r\\nOn September 24, 2007 Apple issued a warning that future updates could render unlocked iPhones unusable.[124] On September 27, 2007, owners of unlocked iPhones who took advantage of the version 1.1.1 update through iTunes reported that the update rendered the device virtually inoperable.[125] There were also reports that the update even affected some iPhones that were not unlocked,[126] and Engadget found that the firmware update had \\"bricked\\" unhacked iPhones as well. The firmware update relocks iPhones, but on October 11 iPhoneSIMFree announced that they had hacked the 1.1.1 iPhone update, not only unlocking them but also unbricking those iPhones which were bricked by the update.[127]\\r\\nOn October 16, 2007, the iPhone Dev Team released AnySIM 1.1, the free utility that unlocks iPhones. The updated version works on firmware version 1.1.1, but doesn't fix baseband problems caused by updating an unlocked 1.0.2 phone up to 1.1.1.[128] On October 23, 2007, the iPhone Elite Dev-Team released Revirginizing Tool to rebuild the lock table in the seczone area to repair the damage done by the original anySIM 1.0x unlockers so unlocked 1.0.2 iPhones can upgrade to 1.1.1 without bricking iPhone. The tool is unbricking the previously bricked iPhones.[129]\\r\\nOn November 21, 2007, T-Mobile announced that due to litigation commenced against them by their competitor Vodafone, which resulted in a preliminary injunction preventing T-Mobile from locking the SIM card to T-Mobile in Germany, it will sell the phone \\"unlocked\\" and will offer iPhone without a T-Mobile contract for ?999 (US$1,478) at its shops to customers in Germany until the court renders a decision.[130] By the end of November, Apple released another version of iPhone firmware, 1.1.2. This version does not have many new features but breaks unlocks.[citation needed] During Macworld '08, on January 15, Apple released the fifth version of iPhone firmware, 1.1.3; this version repairs loopholes used by \\"iPhone Hackers.\\" The firmware, however, had been compromised prior to release and new security measures were quickly bypassed.[citation needed] On February 8, 2008, Geohot released the first full software unlock for the 1.1.2 & 1.1.3 OTB iPhones.","input":"When was the iphone first introduced to the market?"},{"output":"Republicans","context":"The Senate Majority and Minority Leaders are two United States Senators and members of the party leadership of the United States Senate.

They are elected to their positions in the Senate by their respective party caucuses, the Senate Democratic Caucus and the Senate Republican Conference.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy rule, the Presiding Officer gives the Majority Leader priority in obtaining recognition to speak on the floor of the Senate. The Majority Leader customarily serves as the chief representative of their party in the Senate, and sometimes even in all of Congress if the House of Representatives and thus the office of Speaker of the House is controlled by the opposition party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Assistant Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate (commonly called Senate Majority and Minority Whips) are the second-ranking members of each party's leadership. The main function of the Majority and Minority Whips is to gather votes on major issues. Because they are the second ranking members of the Senate, if there is no floor leader present, the whip may become acting floor leader. Before 1969, the official titles were Majority Whip and Minority Whip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Senate is currently composed of 51 Republicans, 47 Democrats, and 2 independents, both of whom caucus with the Democrats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current leaders are long-time Senators Mitch McConnell (R) from Kentucky and Chuck Schumer (D) from New York.

John W. Kern was a Democratic Senator from Indiana. While the title was not official, he is considered[by whom?] to be the first Senate party leader from 1913 through 1917 (and in turn, the first Senate Democratic Leader), while serving concurrently as Chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus. In 1925 the majority (at the time) Republicans also adopted this language when Charles Curtis became the first (official) Majority Leader[citation needed], although his immediate predecessor Henry Cabot Lodge is considered the first (unofficial) Senate Majority Leader.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution designates the Vice President of the United States as President of the United States Senate.

Since the Vice President may be of a different party than the majority and is not a member subject to discipline, the rules of procedure of the Senate give the presiding officer very little power and none beyond the presiding role.  For these reasons, it is the Majority Leader who, in practice, manages the Senate.  This is in contrast to the House of Representatives where the elected Speaker of the House has a great deal of discretionary power and generally presides over votes on bills.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Democratic Party first selected a leader in 1920.

His three-term presidency of South Korea (August 1948 to April 1960) was strongly affected by Cold War tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led South Korea through the Korean War. His presidency ended in resignation following popular protests against a disputed election. Rhee was regarded as an anti-Communist authoritarian leader and is thought to have ordered tens of thousands of extrajudicial killings of suspected communists during the early stages of the Korean War. He died in exile in Honolulu, Hawaii.\\r\\n\\r\\nSyngman Rhee was born on April 18, 1875;[2] his birthday is also stated as March 26[3] (the lunar date)[2]. [4][5] Rhee was born in Hwanghae Province[3] into a rural family of modest means as the third son out of three brothers and two sisters. His two older brothers both died in infancy.[2] Rhee's family traced its lineage back to King Taejong of Joseon.[6] He is a 16th-generation descendant of Grand Prince Yangnyeong. In 1877, at the age of two, Rhee and his family moved to Seoul.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Seoul, he had traditional Confucianism education in various seodang in Nakdong (??; ?g) and Dodong (??; g).[7] He was portrayed as a potential candidate for gwageo, the Korean civil service examination. When Rhee was nine years old, he was rendered virtually blind through smallpox and was cured by Horace Newton Allen, an American medical missionary.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1894, when reforms abolished the gwageo system, Rhee enrolled in the Pai Chai School (????; p?W),[2] an American Methodist school,[4][5] in April. He studied English and sinhakmun (???; ?W??; lit.?new subjects). Near the end of 1895, he joined a Hyeopseong Club (???; ?f??) created by Seo Jae-pil, who returned from the United States. He worked as the head and the main writer of the newspapers Hyeopseong-hoe Hoebo (??? ??; ?f??????; lit.?Hyeopseong Club Newsletter) and Maeil Shinmun (????; ?Nf?; lit.?The Daily Newspaper),[7] the latter being the first daily newspaper in Korea.[8] During this period, he earned money by teaching Americans Korean. He converted to Christianity in school.[8] In 1895, he graduated from Pai Chai School.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nRhee was implicated in a plot to take revenge for the assassination of Empress Myeongseong; however, a female American physician helped him avoid the charges. At this point, he converted to Christianity.[2] Rhee acted as one of the forerunners of Korea's grassroots movement through organizations such as the Hyeopseong Club and the Independence Club (????; ??f??). He organized several protests against corruption and the influences of the Empire of Japan and the Russian Empire.[8] As a result, in November 1898, he attained the rank of Uigwan (??; ݴ) in the Imperial Legislature, the Jungchuwon (???; ?m?).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter entering civil service, he was implicated in a plot to remove King Gojong from power through the recruitment of Park Yeong-hyo.

In August 1905, Rhee and Yun Byeong-gu (???; )[7] met with the Secretary of State John Hay and U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt at peace talks in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and attempted unsuccessfully to convince the US to help preserve independence for Korea.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nRhee continued to stay in the United States; this move has been described as an \\"exile.\\"[8] He obtained a Bachelor of Arts from George Washington University in 1907, and a Master of Arts from Harvard University in 1908.[2][6] In 1910,[2] he obtained a Ph.D. from Princeton University[4][5] with the thesis \\"Neutrality as influenced by the United States\\" (??? ???? ??? ???? ??).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1910, he returned to Japanese occupied Korea.[7][note 1] He served as a YMCA coordinator and missionary.[10][11] In 1912, he was implicated in the 105-Man Incident,[7] and was shortly arrested.[2] However, he fled to the United States in 1912[4] with M. C. Harris's rationale that Rhee was going to participate in the general meeting of Methodists in Minneapolis as the Korean representative.[7][note 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, Rhee attempted to convince Woodrow Wilson to help the people involved in the 105-Man Incident, but failed to bring any change. Soon afterwards, he met Park Yong-man, who was in Nebraska at the time. In February 1913, as a consequence of the meeting, he moved to Honolulu and took over the Han-in Jung-ang Academy (??????; g??W?@).[7] In Hawaii, he began to publish the Pacific Ocean Magazine (?????; Qљ).[2] In 1918, he established the Han-in Christian Church (??????; g?ֶX????). During this period, he opposed Park Yong-man's stance on foreign relations of Korea and brought about a split in the community.[7] In December 1918, he was chosen as one of the Korean representatives to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 by the Korean National Association (??? ???; έg????), but failed to obtain permission to travel to Paris. After giving up traveling to Paris, Rhee held the First Korean Congress (???????) in Philadelphia with Seo Jae-pil to make plans for the declaration and action of independence of Korea.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the March 1st Movement in 1919, Rhee discovered that he was appointed to the positions of Foreign Minister in the Noryeong Provisional Government (??????; @B?r), Prime Minister for the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai, and a position equivalent to President for the Hansung Provisional Government (??????; ?h?r). In June, in the acting capacity of the President of the Republic of Korea, he notified the prime ministers and the chairmen of peace conferences of Korea's independence. On August 25, Rhee established the Korean Commission to America and Europe (?????; ?Wˇ?T) in Washington, D.C. On September 6, Rhee discovered that he had been appointed acting president for the Provisional Government in Shanghai.[4][5] From December 1920 to May 1921, he moved to Shanghai and was the acting president for the Provisional Government.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Rhee failed to efficiently act in the capacity of Acting President due to conflicts inside the provisional government in Shanghai. In October 1920, he returned to the US to participate in the Washington Naval Conference. During the conference, he attempted to set the problem of Korean independence as part of the agenda and campaigned for independence, but was unsuccessful.[2][7] In September 1922, he returned to Hawaii to focus on publication, education, and religion. In November 1924, Rhee was appointed the position of President-for-Life in the Korean Comrade Society (??????; έg???).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1925, Rhee was impeached as the president of the Provisional Government in Shanghai over allegations of misuse of power[12] and was removed from office. Nevertheless, he continued to claim the position of President by referring to the Hansung Provisional Government and continued independence activities through the Korean Commission to America and Europe. In the beginning of 1933, he participated in the League of Nations conference in Geneva to bring up the question of Korean independence.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1939, Rhee and his wife left Hawaii for Washington. He focused on writing the book Japan Inside Out and published it during the summer of 1941. With the attack on Pearl Harbor and the consequent Pacific War which began in December 1941, Rhee used his position as the chairman of the foreign relations department of the provisional government in Chongqing to convince President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the United States Department of State to approve the existence of the Korean provisional government. As part of this plan, he cooperated with anti-Japan strategies conducted by the Office of Strategic Services. In 1945, he participated in the United Nations Conference on International Organization as the leader of the Korean representatives to request the participation of the Korean provisional government.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945,[13] Rhee was flown to Tokyo aboard a U.S. military aircraft.[14] Over the objections of the State Department, the American military government allowed Rhee to return to Korea by providing him with a passport in October 1945, despite the refusal of the State Department to issue Rhee with a passport.[15] The British historian Max Hastings wrote that there was \\"at least a measure of corruption in the transaction\\" as the American OSS agent Preston Goodfellow who provided Rhee with the passport that allowed him to return to Korea was apparently promised by Rhee that if he came to power, he would reward Goodfellow with commercial concessions.\\"[15] Following the independence of Korea and a secret meeting with Douglas MacArthur, Rhee was flown in mid-October 1945 to Seoul aboard MacArthur's personal airplane, The Bataan.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the return to Korea, he assumed the posts of president of the Independence Promotion Central Committee (?????????; ?ٗḜ?fݴ??), chairman of the Korean People's Representative Democratic Legislature (??????????; έg?W?Ͱݴ), and president of the Headquarters for Unification (???????; A~?). At this point, he was strongly anti-communist and opposed foreign intervention; he opposed Soviet Union and United States' proposal in the Moscow Conference (1945) to establish a trusteeship for Korea and the cooperation between the left-wing (communist) and the right-wing (nationalist) parties. He also refused to join the U.S.ÿSoviet Cooperation Committee (???????; ˇW?T??) as well as the negotiations with the north.[7] The Korean nationalist movement had for decades been torn by factionalism and in-fighting, and most of the leaders of the independence movement hated each other as much as they hated the Japanese. Rhee, who had lived for decades in the United States, was a figure known only from afar in Korea, and therefore regarded as a more or less acceptable compromise candidate for the conservative factions. More importantly, Rhee spoke fluent English whereas none of his rivals did, and therefore he was the Korean politician most trusted and favored by the American occupation government. The British diplomat Roger Makins later recalled, \\"the American propensity to go for a man rather than a movement  Giraud among the French in 1942, Chiang Kai-shek in China. Americans have always liked the idea of dealing with a foreign leader who can be identified as 'their man'. They are much less comfortable with movements.\\" Makins further added the same was the case with Rhee, as very few Americans were fluent in Korean in the 1940s or knew much about Korea, and it was simply far easier for the American occupation government to deal with Rhee than to try to understand Korea. Rhee was \\"acerbic, prickly, unpromising\\" and was regarded by the U.S. State Department, which long had dealings with him as \\"a dangerous mischief-maker\\", but the American General John R. Hodge decided that Rhee was the best man for the Americans to back because of his fluent English and his ability to talk with authority to American officers about American subjects. Once it become clear from October 1945 onward that Rhee was the Korean politician most favored by the Americans, other conservative leaders fell in behind him. Hastings wrote, \\"In an Asian society, where politics are often dominated by an instinctive desire to fall in behind the strongest force, Rhee's backing from the military government was the decisive factor in his rise to power.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the first U.S.ÿSoviet Cooperation Committee meeting was concluded without a result, he began to argue in June 1946 that the government of Korea must be established as an independent entity.[7] In the same month, he created a plan based on this idea[2] and moved to Washington, D.C. from December 1946 to April 1947 to lobby support for the plan. During the visit, Harry S. Truman's policies of Containment and the Truman Doctrine, which was announced in March 1947, enforced Rhee's anti-communist ideas.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly recognized Korea's independence and established the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK) through Resolution 112.[16][17] In May 1948, the South Korean Constitutional Assembly election was held under the oversight of the UNTCOK.[7] He was elected without competition to serve in the South Korean Constitutional Assembly (???? ????; έg?g?????) and was consequently selected to be Speaker of the Assembly. Rhee was highly influential in creating the policy stating that the president of South Korea had to be elected by the National Assembly.[2] The 1948 Constitution of the Republic of Korea was adopted on July 17, 1948.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 20, 1948, Rhee was elected president of the Republic of Korea[4][5][18] in the South Korean presidential election, 1948 with 92.3% of the vote; the second candidate, Kim Gu, received 6.7% of the vote.[19] On August 15, the Republic of Korea was formally established in South Korea[18] and Rhee was inaugurated as the first President of the Republic of Korea.[2][7] The next month, on September 9, the north also proclaimed statehood as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Rhee himself had been an independence activist, and his relations with the chinilpa Korean elites who had collaborated with the Japanese were, in the words of the South Korean historian Kyung Moon Hwang, often \\"contentious,\\" but in the end an understanding was reached in which, in exchange for their support, Rhee would not purge the elites.[20] In particular, the Koreans who had served in the colonial-era National Police, whom the Americans had retained after August 1945, were promised by Rhee that their jobs would not be threatened by him. Upon independence in 1948, 53% of South Korean police officers were men who had served in the National Police during the Japanese occupation.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after taking office, Rhee enacted laws that severely curtailed political dissent. There was much controversy between Rhee and his leftist opponents. Allegedly, many of the leftist opponents were arrested and in some cases killed. The most controversial issue has been Kim Gu's assassination. On 26 June 1949, Kim Gu was assassinated by Ahn Doo-hee, who confessed that he assassinated Kim Gu by the order of Kim Chang-ryong. The assassin was described by the British historian Max Hastings as one of Rhee's \\"creatures\\".[22] It soon became apparent that Rhee's governing was going to be authoritarian.[23] He allowed the internal security force (headed by his right-hand man, Kim Chang-ryong) to detain and torture suspected communists and North Korean agents. His government also oversaw several massacres, including the suppression of the Jeju Uprising on Jeju island, of which South Korea's Truth Commission reported 14,373 victims, 86% at the hands of the security forces and 13.9% at the hands of communist rebels,[24] and the Mungyeong massacre.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy early 1950 Rhee had about 30,000 alleged communists in his jails, and had about 300,000 suspected sympathisers enrolled in an official \\"re-education\\" movement called the Bodo League. When the Communist army attacked from the North in June, retreating South Korean forces executed the prisoners, along with several tens of thousands of Bodo League members.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Rhee and Kim Il-sung wanted to unite the Korean peninsula under their respective governments, but the United States refused to give South Korea any heavy weapons, in order to ensure that its military could only be used for preserving internal order and self-defense.[citation needed] By contrast, Pyongyang was well equipped with Soviet aircraft and tanks. According to John Merrill, \\"the war was preceded by a major insurgency in the South and serious clashes along the thirty-eighth parallel,\\" and 100,000 people died in \\"political disturbances, guerrilla warfare, and border clashes\\".[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the outbreak of hostilities on June 25, 1950, all South Korean resistance at the 38th parallel was overwhelmed by the North Korean offensive within a few hours.  By June 26, it was apparent that the Korean People's Army (KPA) would occupy Seoul. Rhee stated, \\"Every Cabinet member, including myself, will protect the government, and parliament has decided to remain in Seoul. Citizens should not worry and remain in their workplaces.\\"[27] However, Rhee had already left the city with most of his government on June 27. At midnight on June 28, the South Korean military destroyed the Han Bridge, thereby preventing thousands of citizens from fleeing. On June 28, North Korean soldiers occupied Seoul.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the North Korean occupation of Seoul, Rhee established a temporary government in Busan and created a defensive perimeter along the Naktong Bulge. A series of battles ensued, which would later be known collectively as the Battle of Naktong Bulge. After the Battle of Inchon in September 1950, the North Korean military was routed, and the United Nations (UN)of whom the largest contingents were the Americans and South Koreansnot only liberated all of South Korea, but overran much of North Korea. In the areas of North Korea taken by the UN forces, elections were supposed to be administered by the United Nations, but instead were taken over and administered by the South Koreans. After the Chinese entered the war in November 1950, the UN forces were thrown into retreat. During this period of crisis, Rhee ordered the December Massacres of 1950.\\r\\n\\r\\nHastings notes that, during the war, Rhee's official salary was equal to $37.50 (U.S. dollars) per month. Both at the time and since, there has been much speculation about precisely how Rhee managed to live on a salary equivalent to $37.50 per month. The entire Rhee regime was notorious for its corruption, with everyone in the government from the President downwards stealing as much they possibly could from both the public purse and aid from the United States. The Rhee regime engaged in the \\"worst excesses of corruption,\\" with the soldiers in the Army of the Republic of Korea (ROK) going unpaid for months as their officers embezzled their pay, equipment provided by the United States being sold on the black market, and the size of the ROK army being bloated by hundreds of thousands of \\"ghost soldiers\\" who only existed on paper, allowing their officers to steal pay that would have been due had these soldiers actually existed. The problems with low morale experienced by the ROK army were largely due to the corruption of the Rhee regime. The worst scandal during the warindeed of the entire Rhee governmentwas the National Defense Corps Incident. Rhee created the National Defense Corps in December 1950, intended to be a paramilitary militia, comprising men not in the military or police who be drafted into the corps for internal security duties. In the months that followed, thousands of National Defense Corps men either starved or froze to death in their unheated barracks, as the men lacked winter uniforms. Even Rhee could not ignore the deaths of so many of the National Defense Corps and ordered an investigation. It was revealed that commander of the National Defense Corps, General Kim Yun Gun, had stolen millions of American dollars that were intended to heat the barracks and feed and clothe the men. General Kim and five other officers were publicly shot at Daegu on August 12, 1951, following their convictions for corruption.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1951, Rheewho was upset about MacArthur's dismissal by President Trumanlashed out in a press interview against Britain, whom he blamed for MacArthur's sacking.[29] Rhee was absolutely committed to reunifying Korea under his leadership and strongly supported MacArthur's call for going all-out against China, even at the risk of provoking a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Rhee declared, \\"The British troops have outlived their welcome in my country.\\" Shortly thereafter, Rhee told an Australian diplomat about the Australian troops fighting for his country, \\"They are not wanted here any longer. Tell that to your government. The Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and British troops all represent a government which is now sabotaging the brave American effort to liberate fully and unify my unhappy nation.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nRhee was strongly against the armistice negotiations the U.S. entered into in 1953. Accordingly, in April of the same year, he demanded of President Eisenhower a total withdrawal of his troops from the peninsula if an armistice were to be signed, declaring that the ROK would rather fight on its own than negotiate a cease-fire. He also deliberately carried out some actions that would deter the armistice and reignite conflicts in the region, the most provocative one being his unilateral release of 25,000 prisoners of war in June 1953.[30] Such actions, which hindered the progress of armistice talks, upset China and the North. Moreover, for such unpredictability in his authoritarian leadership, the Truman and Eisenhower administrations considered him one of the rogue allies in East Asia and engaged in \\"powerplay\\", or the construction of asymmetric alliances, which helped the U.S. maximize economic and political influence over the ROK and increase ROK's dependency on the United States.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 27, 1953, at last, one of the 20th century's most vicious and frustrating wars[32] came to an end with no apparent victor. Ultimately, the armistice agreement was signed by military commanders from China and the North, with the United Nations Command, led by the U.S., signing on the behalf of the international community.[33] Its signatories did not include the ROK, however, as Rhee refused to agree to the armistice, and neither was it supposed to be a permanent cease-fire, as a peace treaty was never signed. Nevertheless, to this very day, the armistice remains the only means for security and peace on the Korean peninsula.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of widespread discontent with Rhee's corruption and political repression, it was considered unlikely that Rhee would be re-elected by the National Assembly. To circumvent this, Rhee attempted to amend the constitution to allow him to hold elections for the presidency by direct popular vote. When the Assembly rejected this amendment, Rhee ordered a mass arrest of opposition politicians and then passed the desired amendment in July 1952. During the following presidential election, he received 74% of the vote.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war ended in July 1953, South Korea struggled to rebuild following nationwide devastation. The country remained at a Third-World level of development and was heavily reliant on U.S. aid. Rhee was easily re-elected for what should have been the final time in 1956 since the 1948 constitution limited the president to two consecutive terms. However, soon after being sworn in, he had the legislature amend the constitution to allow the incumbent presidenthimselfto run for an unlimited number of terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960, the 84-year-old Rhee won his fourth term in office as President with 90% of the vote. His victory was assured after the main opposition candidate, Cho Byeong-ok, died shortly before the March 15 elections.\\r\\n\\r\\nRhee wanted his protg, Lee Ki-poong, elected as Vice Presidenta separate office under Korean law at that time. When Lee, who was running against Chang Myon (the ambassador to the United States during the Korean War, a member from the opposition Democratic Party) won the vote with a wide margin, the opposition Democratic Party claimed the election was rigged. This triggered anger among segments of the Korean populace on April 19. When police shot demonstrators in Masan, the student-led April Revolution forced Rhee to resign on April 26.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 28, a DC-4 belonging to the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), piloted by Captain Harry B. Cockrell, Jr. and operated by Civil Air Transport, covertly flew Rhee out of South Korea as protesters converged on the Blue House.[35] During the journey, Rhee and Franziska Donner, his Austrian wife, came up to the cockpit to thank the pilot and crew. Rhee's wife offered the pilot a substantial diamond ring in thanks, which was courteously declined. The former president, his wife, and their adopted son subsequently lived in exile in Honolulu, Hawaii.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1933, Rhee met Austrian Franziska Donner in Geneva.[36] At the time, Rhee was participating in a League of Nations meeting[36] and Donner was working as an interpreter.[12] In October 1934, they were married[36] in New York City.[12] She also acted as his secretary.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nRhee died of a stroke on July 19, 1965. A week later, his body was returned to Seoul and buried in the Seoul National Cemetery.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nRhee's former Seoul residence, Ihwajang, is currently used for the presidential memorial museum. The Woo-Nam Presidential Preservation Foundation has been set up to honor his legacy. There is also a memorial museum located in Hwajinpo near Kim Il Sung's cottage.\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Syngman Rhee at Wikimedia Commons\\r\\n\\r\\n?Impeached, but restored to office","input":"Who was the first president of south korea?"},{"output":"Christopher Marlowe","context":"Faust is the protagonist of a classic German legend, based on the historical Johann Georg Faust (c. 1480ÿ1540).\\r\\nFaust is an erudite who is highly successful yet dissatisfied with his life, which leads him to make a pact with the Devil, exchanging his soul for unlimited knowledge and worldly pleasures. The Faust legend has been the basis for many literary, artistic, cinematic, and musical works that have reinterpreted it through the ages. \\"Faust\\" and the adjective \\"Faustian\\" imply a situation in which an ambitious person surrenders moral integrity in order to achieve power and success for a delimited term.[1][2]\\r\\nThe Faust of early booksas well as the ballads, dramas, movies, and puppet-plays which grew out of themis irrevocably damned because he prefers human to divine knowledge; \\"he laid the Holy Scriptures behind the door and under the bench, refused to be called doctor of Theology, but preferred to be styled doctor of Medicine\\".[1] Plays and comic puppet theatre loosely based on this legend were popular throughout Germany in the 16th century, often reducing Faust and Mephistopheles to figures of vulgar fun. The story was popularised in England by Christopher Marlowe, who gave it a classic treatment in his play, The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (whose date of publication is debated, but likely around 1587).[3] In Goethe's reworking of the story two hundred years later, Faust becomes a dissatisfied intellectual who yearns for \\"more than earthly meat and drink\\" in his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFaust is bored and depressed with his life as a scholar. After an attempt to take his own life, he calls on the Devil for further knowledge and magic powers with which to indulge all the pleasure and knowledge of the world. In response, the Devil's representative, Mephistopheles, appears. He makes a bargain with Faust: Mephistopheles will serve Faust with his magic powers for a set number of years, but at the end of the term, the Devil will claim Faust's soul, and Faust will be eternally enslaved.\\r\\nDuring the term of the bargain, Faust makes use of Mephistopheles in various ways. In many versions of the story, particularly Goethe's drama, Mephistopheles helps Faust seduce a beautiful and innocent girl, usually named Gretchen, whose life is ultimately destroyed when she gives birth to Faust's bastard son. Realizing this unholy act, she drowns the child, and is held for murder. However, Gretchen's innocence saves her in the end, and she enters Heaven after execution. In Goethe's rendition, Faust is saved by God via his constant strivingin combination with Gretchen's pleadings with God in the form of the eternal feminine. However, in the early tales, Faust is irrevocably corrupted and believes his sins cannot be forgiven; when the term ends, the Devil carries him off to Hell.\\r\\nMany aspects of the life of Simon Magus are echoed in the Faust legend of Christopher Marlowe and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Hans Jonas writes, \\"surely few admirers of Marlowe's and Goethe's plays have an inkling that their hero is the descendant of a gnostic sectary and that the beautiful Helen called up by his art was once the fallen Thought of God through whose raising mankind was to be saved.\\"[4] The tale of Faust bears many similarities to the Theophilus legend recorded in the 13th century, writer Gautier de Coincy's Les Miracles de la Sainte Vierge. Here, a saintly figure makes a bargain with the keeper of the infernal world but is rescued from paying his debt to society through the mercy of the Blessed Virgin.[5] A depiction of the scene in which he subordinates himself to the Devil appears on the north tympanum of the Cathedrale de Notre Dame de Paris.[6]\\r\\nThe origin of Faust's name and persona remains unclear.[dubious ÿ discuss] The character is ostensibly based on Johann Georg Faust (c. 1480ÿ1540), a magician and alchemist probably from Knittlingen, Wrttemberg, who obtained a degree in divinity from Heidelberg University in 1509, but the legendary Faust has also been connected with Johann Fust (c. 1400ÿ1466), Johann Gutenberg's business partner,[7] or suggest that Fust is one of the multiple origins to the Faust story.[8]\\r\\nScholars such as[weasel?words] Frank Baron[9] and Leo Ruickbie[10] contest[weasel?words] many of these[which?] previous assumptions.[clarification needed]\\r\\nThe character in Polish folklore named Pan Twardowski presents similarities with Faust. The Polish story seems to have originated at roughly the same time as its German counterpart, yet It is unclear whether the two tales have a common origin or influenced each other. The historical Johann Georg Faust had studied in Krak܇w for a time, and may have served as the inspiration for the character in the Polish legend.\\r\\nThe first known printed source of the legend of Faust is a small chapbook bearing the title Historia von D. Johann Fausten, published in 1587. The book was re-edited and borrowed from throughout the 16th century. Other similar books of that period include:\\r\\nThe 1725 Faust chapbook was widely circulated and also read by the young Goethe.\\r\\nRelated tales about a pact between man and the Devil include the plays Mariken van Nieumeghen (Dutch, early 16th century, author unknown), Cenodoxus (German, early 17th century, by Jacob Bidermann) and The Countess Cathleen (Irish Legend of unknown origin believed by some to be taken from the French play Les marchands d'ames).\\r\\nStaufen, a town in the extreme southwest of Germany, claims to be where Faust died (c. 1540); depictions appear on buildings, etc. The only historical source for this tradition is a passage in the Chronik der Grafen von Zimmern, which was written around 1565, 25 years after Faust's presumed death. These chronicles are generally considered reliable, and in the 16th century there were still family ties between the lords of Staufen and the counts of Zimmern in nearby Donaueschingen.[11]\\r\\nIn Christopher Marlowe's original telling of the tale, Wittenburg where Faust studied was also written as Wertenberge. This has led to a measure of speculation as to where precisely his story is set. Some scholars have suggested the Duchy of Wrttemberg; others have suggested an allusion to Marlowe's own Cambridge (Gill, 2008, p.?5), but the likely placement of Wittenberg is the historical capital of Wrttemberg, what is now the city of Stuttgart.\\r\\nThe early Faust chapbook, while in circulation in northern Germany, found its way to England, where in 1592 an English translation was published, The Historie of the Damnable Life, and Deserved Death of Doctor Iohn Faustus credited to a certain \\"P. F., Gent[leman]\\". Christopher Marlowe used this work as the basis for his more ambitious play, The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (published c. 1604). Marlowe also borrowed from John Foxe's Book of Martyrs, on the exchanges between Pope Adrian VI and a rival pope.\\r\\nAnother important version of the incredible legend is the play Faust, written by the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The first part, which is the one more closely connected to the earlier legend, was published in 1808, the second posthumously in 1832.\\r\\nGoethe's Faust complicates the simple Christian moral of the original legend. A hybrid between a play and an extended poem, Goethe's two-part \\"closet drama\\" is epic in scope. It gathers together references from Christian, medieval, Roman, eastern, and Hellenic poetry, philosophy, and literature.\\r\\nThe composition and refinement of Goethe's own version of the legend occupied him for over sixty years (though not continuously). The final version, published after his death, is recognized as a great work of German literature.\\r\\nThe story concerns the fate of Faust in his quest for the true essence of life (\\"was die Welt im Innersten zusammenh?lt\\"). Frustrated with learning and the limits to his knowledge, power, and enjoyment of life, he attracts the attention of the Devil (represented by Mephistopheles), who makes a bet with Faust that he will be able to satisfy him; a notion that Faust is incredibly reluctant towards, as he believes this happy zenith will never come. This is a significant difference between Goethe's \\"Faust\\" and Marlowe's; Faust is not the one who suggests the wager.\\r\\nIn the first part, Mephistopheles leads Faust through experiences that culminate in a lustful relationship with Gretchen, an innocent young woman. Gretchen and her family are destroyed by Mephistopheles' deceptions and Faust's desires. Part one of the story ends in tragedy for Faust, as Gretchen is saved but Faust is left to grieve in shame.\\r\\nThe second part begins with the spirits of the earth forgiving Faust (and the rest of mankind) and progresses into allegorical poetry. Faust and his Devil pass through and manipulate the world of politics and the world of the classical gods, and meet with Helen of Troy (the personification of beauty). Finally, having succeeded in taming the very forces of war and nature, Faust experiences a singular moment of happiness.\\r\\nMephistopheles tries to seize Faust's soul when he dies after this moment of happiness, but is frustrated and enraged when angels intervene due to God's grace. Though this grace is truly 'gratuitous' and does not condone Faust's frequent errors perpetrated with Mephistopheles, the angels state that this grace can only occur because of Faust's unending striving and due to the intercession of the forgiving Gretchen. The final scene has Faust's soul carried to heaven in the presence of God by the intercession of the \\"Virgin, Mother, Queen, ... Goddess kind forever... Eternal Womanhood.[12] The Goddess is thus victorious over Mephistopheles, who had insisted at Faust's death that he would be consigned to \\"The Eternal Empty.\\"\\r\\nS?ren Kierkegaard, Either/Or, Immediate Stages of the Erotic\\r\\nThe story of Faust is woven into Dr. Mikhail Bulgakov's best-known novel, The Master and Margarita (1928ÿ1940) with Margarita being modeled on Gretchen and the Master on Faust.[citation needed] Other characters in the novel include Woland (whose description recalls Mephistopheles) and Mikhail Alexandrovitch Berlioz (the head of Massolit).\\r\\nThomas Mann's 1947 Doktor Faustus: Das Leben des deutschen Tonsetzers Adrian Leverkhn, erz?hlt von einem Freunde adapts the Faust legend to a 20th-century context, documenting the life of fictional composer Adrian Leverkhn as analog and embodiment of the early 20th-century history of Germany and of Europe. The talented Leverkhn, after contracting venereal disease from a brothel visit, forms a pact with a Mephistophelean character to grant him 24 years of brilliance and success as a composer. He produces works of increasing beauty to universal acclaim, even while physical illness begins to corrupt his body. In 1930, when presenting his final masterwork (The Lamentation of Dr Faust ), he confesses the pact he had made: madness and syphilis now overcome him, and he suffers a slow and total collapse until his death in 1940. Leverkhn's spiritual, mental, and physical collapse and degradation are mapped on to the period in which Nazism rose in Germany, and Leverkhn's fate is shown as that of the soul of Germany.\\r\\nStephen Vincent Bent's short story The Devil and Daniel Webster published in 1937 is a retelling of the tale of Faust based on the short story The Devil and Tom Walker, written by Washington Irving. Benet's version of the story centers on a New Hampshire farmer by the name of Jabez Stone who, plagued with unending bad luck, is approached by the devil under the name of Mr. Scratch who offers him seven years of prosperity in exchange for his soul. Jabez Stone is eventually defended by Daniel Webster, a fictional version of the famous lawyer and orator, in front of a judge and jury of the damned, and his case is won.\\r\\nF.W. Murnau, director of the classic Nosferatu, directed a silent version of Faust that premiered in 1926. Murnau's film featured special effects that were remarkable for the era. Many of these shots are impressive today.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn one, Mephisto towers over a town, dark wings spread wide, as a fog rolls in bringing the plague. In another, an extended montage sequence shows Faust, mounted behind Mephisto, riding through the heavens, and the camera view, effectively swooping through quickly changing panoramic backgrounds, courses past snowy mountains, high promontories and cliffs, and waterfalls.\\r\\nIn the Murnau version of the tale, the aging bearded scholar and alchemist, now disillusionedby a palpable failure of his antidotal, dark liquid in a phial, a supposed cure for victims in his plague-stricken townFaust renounces his many years of hard travail and studies in alchemy. We see this despair, watching him haul all his bound volumes by armloads onto a growing pyre; he intends to burn everything. But a wind comes, from offscreen, that turns over a few cabalistic leavesfrom one of the books' pages, sheets not yet in flames, one and another just catching Fausts eye. Their words contain a prescription for how to invoke the dreadful dark forces.\\r\\nFollowing Faust heeding these recipes, we see him begin enacting the mystic protocols: on a hill, alone, summoning Mephisto, certain forces begin to convene, and Faust in a state of growing trepidation hesitates, and begins to withdraw; he flees along a winding, twisting pathway, returning to his study chambers. At pauses along this retreat, though, he meets a reappearing figure. Each time, it doffs its hatin a greeting, that is Mephisto, confronting him. Mephisto overcomes Faust's reluctance to sign a long binding pact with the invitation that Faust may try on these powers, just for one day, and without obligation to longer terms. It comes the end of that day, the sands of twenty-four hours having run out, after Fausts having been restored to youth and, helped by his servant Mephisto to steal a beautiful woman from her wedding feast, Faust is tempted so much that he agrees to sign a pact for eternity (which is to say when, in due course, his time runs out). Eventually Faust becomes bored with the pursuit of pleasure and returns home, where he falls in love with the beautiful and innocent Gretchen. His corruption (enabled, or embodied, through the forms of Mephisto) ultimately ruins both their lives, though there is still a chance for redemption in the end.\\r\\nSimilarities to Goethe's Faust include the classic tale of a man who sold his soul to the Devil, the same Mephisto wagering with an angel to corrupt the soul of Faust, the plague sent by Mephisto on Faust's small town, and the familiar cliffhanger with Faust unable to find a cure for The Plague, and therefore turning to Mephisto, renouncing God, the angel, and science alike.\\r\\nDirected by Ren Clair, 1950 ÿ A somewhat comedic adaptation with Michel Simon as Mephistopheles/Faust as old man, and Grard Philipe as Faust transformed into a young man.\\r\\nDirected by Istvn Szab܇, 1981 ÿ An actor in 1930s Germany aligns himself with the Nazi party for prestige.\\r\\nDirected by Jan ?vankmajer, 1994 ÿ The source material of ?vankmajer's film is the Faust legend; including traditional Czech puppet show versions, this film production uses a variety of cinematic formats, such as stop-motion photography animation and claymation.\\r\\nDirected by Aleksandr Sokurov, 2011 ÿ German-language film starring Johannes Zeiler, Anton Adasinsky, Isolda Dychauk.\\r\\nDirected by Ash Avildsen, 2017 ÿ A rock and roll modern retelling of the Faust legend starring Andy Biersack as Johnny Faust.[14]\\r\\nMexican comedian Chespirito acted as Faust in a sketch adaptation of the legend. Ramon Valdez played Mephistopheles (presenting himself also as The Devil), and in this particular version, Faust sells his soul by signing a contract, after which Mephistopheles gives him an object known as the \\"Chirrn-Chirri܇n\\" (which resembles a horse whip) which grants him the power to make things, people or even youth or age, appear or disappear, by speaking the object's name, followed by the word \\"Chirrn\\" (for them to appear) or \\"Chirri܇n\\" (for them to disappear). After Faust's youth is restored, he uses his powers to try conquering the heart of his assistant Margarita (played by Florinda Meza). However, after several failed (and funny) attempts to do so, he discovers she already has a boyfriend, and realizes he sold his soul for nothing. At this point, Mephistopheles returns to take Faust's soul to hell, producing the signed contract for supporting his claim.

Named in honor of LTC William Bliss (1815-1853), a mathematical genius who was the son-in-law of President Zachary Taylor, Ft. Bliss has an area of about 1,700 square miles (4,400?km2); it is the largest installation in FORSCOM (United States Army Forces Command) and second-largest in the Army overall (the largest being the adjacent White Sands Missile Range). The portion of the post located in El Paso County, Texas, is a census-designated place with a population of 8,591 as of the time of the 2010 census. Fort Bliss provides the largest contiguous tract (1,500?sq?mi or 3,900?km2) of restricted airspace[7] in the Continental United States, used for missile and artillery training and testing, and at 992,000 acres boasts the largest maneuver area (ahead of the National Training Center, which has 642,000 acres).[1]\\r\\nFort Bliss is home to the 1st Armored Division, which returned to US soil in 2011 after 40 years in Germany. The division is supported by the 15th Sustainment Brigade. The installation is also home to the 32nd Army Air & Missile Defense Command, the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, the 212th Fires Brigade (now reflagged as the 1st Armored Division Artillery Brigade),[8] and the 402nd Field Artillery Brigade.\\r\\nThe headquarters for the El Paso Intelligence Center, a federal tactical operational intelligence center, is hosted at Fort Bliss. Its DoD (United States Department of Defense) counterpart, Joint Task Force North, is at Biggs Army Airfield. Biggs Field, a military airport[9] located at Fort Bliss, is designated a military power projection platform.[10]\\r\\nFort Bliss National Cemetery is located on the post. Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Fort Stockton, Fort Davis, Richardson, McKavett, Clark, Fort McIntosh, Fort Inge and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma.[11] There were \\"sub posts or intermediate stations\\" including Bothwick's Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1846, Colonel Alexander Doniphan led 1st Regiment of Missouri mounted volunteers through El Paso del Norte, with victories at the Battle of El Brazito and the Battle of the Sacramento. Then on 7 November 1848, War Department General Order no. 58 ordered the establishment of a post[13] across from El Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Jurez).[14] On 8 September 1849, the garrison party of several companies of the 3rd U.S. Infantry ('The Old Guard', currently the oldest active duty regiment in the US Army), commanded by Major Jefferson Van Horne, found only four small and scattered settlements on the north side of the Rio Grande. The Post Opposite El Paso del Norte was first established at the site of Coon's Ranch (often erroneously referred to as Smith's Ranch, now downtown El Paso)[13]:21 and, along with Fort Selden and other Southwestern outposts, protected recently won territory from harassing Apaches and Comanches, provided law and order, and escorted the forty-niners.[13]:17 Van Horne also had nominal command of the Post at San Elizario, the former Presidio of San Elizario, seventeen miles downstream from El Paso del Norte.[13]:9,17 With constant Indian raids, garrisons had to be moved frequently to meet the shifting threats. In September 1851, the Post Opposite El Paso and the Post at San Elizario were closed, the soldiers moved 40 miles (64?km) north to Fort Fillmore.[13]:20ÿ21\\r\\nOn 11 January 1854, Companies B, E, I and K of the 8th Infantry, under the command of Lt. Col. Edmund B. Alexander, established Post of El Paso at Magoffinsville under orders from Secretary of War Jefferson Davis.[13]:23[15] The post became Fort Bliss on 8 March 1854.[13]:23 in honor of Lt. Col. William Wallace Smith Bliss, a veteran of the Mexican War (1846-1848) who was cited for gallantry in action.\\r\\nThere it remained for the next 14 years, serving as a base for troops guarding the area against Apache attacks. Until 1861 most of these troops were units of the 8th Infantry Brigade.[16] At the outbreak of the American Civil War, the Commander of the Department of Texas ordered the garrison to surrender Fort Bliss to the Confederacy, which Col. Isaac Van Duzen Reeve did on 31 March 1861.[13]:29 Confederate forces consisting of the 2nd Regiment of Texas, under the command of Col. John R. Baylor, took the post on 1 July 1861,[13]:29 and used the post as a platform to launch attacks into New Mexico and Arizona in an effort to force the Union garrisons still in these states to surrender. Initially the Confederate Army had success in their attempts to gain control of New Mexico, but following the Battle of Glorieta Pass Confederate soldiers were forced to retreat. The Confederate garrison abandoned Fort Bliss without a fight the next year when a Federal column of 2,350 men under the command of Colonel James H. Carleton advanced from California.[13]:30 The Californians maintained an irregular garrison at Fort Bliss until 1865 when 5th Infantry units arrived to reestablish the post, who were subsequently relieved by the 25th Infantry, Buffalo Soldiers, on 12 August 1866, followed by the 35th Infantry two months later.[13]:33, 35\\r\\nAfter May 1867 Rio Grande flooding seriously damaged the Magoffinsville post, Fort Bliss was moved to a site called Camp Concordia in March 1868.[13]:35 Camp Concordia's location was immediately south of what is now Interstate 10, across from Concordia Cemetery in El Paso. The Rio Grande was about a mile south of the camp at that time; water was hauled daily by mule team to the camp. On 11 March 1869 the old name of Fort Bliss was resumed.[13]:36 Water, heating, and sanitation facilities were at a minimum in the adobe buildings of the fort; records reveal that troops suffered severely from dysentery and malaria and that supplies arrived irregularly over the Santa Fe Trail by wagon train. The Concordia post was abandoned in January 1877,[13]:36 and after troops left in January, El Paso was without a garrison for more than a year. By that time, the town and its environs on the north side of the river had swelled to a population of almost 800.\\r\\nOn New Year's Day,1878,[13]:36 Fort Bliss was established as a permanent post; the Company L Buffalo Soldiers of the Ninth Cavalry and Company C of the 15th Infantry, were sent to Fort Bliss to prevent further trouble over the salt beds and the usage of Rio Grande water for irrigation purposes.[13]:36,39 Prior to this date, the government had had a policy of simply leasing property for its military installations. Now, however, a tract of 135 acres (0.55?km2) was purchased at Hart's Mill on the river's edge in the Pass, near what is today the UTEP. With a $40,000 appropriation, a building program was begun. The first railroad arrived in 1881, and tracks were laid across the military reservation, thereby solving the supply problems for the fort and the rapidly growing town of El Paso. By 1890, Hart's Mill had outlived its usefulness, and Congress appropriated $150,000 for construction of a military installation[13]:50 on the mesa approximately 5 miles (8.0?km) east of El Paso's 1890 city limits. Although no money was appropriated for the land, $8,250 was easily raised by the local residents, who realized the economic benefit to the area.[17]\\r\\nThe present site of Fort Bliss on La Noria mesa,[19] was laid out by Captain John Ruhlen from 1891 to 1892 and was first occupied by four companies of the 18th Infantry in October 1893.[13]:50[20]\\r\\nIn January 1914, John J. Pershing arrived[21] in El Paso to take command of the Army 8th Brigade that was stationed at Fort Bliss. At the time, the Mexican Revolution was underway in Mexico, and the 8th Brigade had been assigned the task of securing the MexicoÿUnited States border. In March 1915, under the command of General Frederick Funston, Pershing led the 8th Brigade on the failed 1916ÿ1917 Punitive Expedition into Mexico in search of outlaw Pancho Villa.[22]\\r\\nOn Friday, 11 March 2016, members of the 2nd Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment, (3rd BCT, 1st Armored Division, Fort Bliss) conducted a staff ride at Pancho Villa State Park, NM, the former site of Camp Furlong, 2nd Squadron's billet in 1915. They reviewed the terrain of the 9 March 1916 raid by Pancho Villa's forces on the unit 100 years before. 2nd Squadron then participated in a parade with reenactors, and Roll Call of the fallen.[23]\\r\\nDuring this time, the military airfield in El Paso would become one of the homes to the United States Army Border Air Patrol and the 1st Aero Squadron, the U.S. Armys first tactical unit equipped with airplanes.\\r\\nAs American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) commander (1917ÿ1918), John J. Pershing transferred to Fort Bliss and was responsible for the organization, training, and supply of an inexperienced force that eventually grew from 27,000 men to over 2,000,000the National Army of World War I.\\r\\nFrom 10 December 1917 ÿ 12 May 1918, the wartime 15th Cavalry Division existed at Fort Bliss. Similarly, the Headquarters, 2nd Cavalry Brigade was initially activated at Fort Bliss on 10 December 1917 and then deactivated in July 1919, but then reactivated at Fort Bliss on 31 August 1920. Predominantly a cavalry post since 1912, Fort Bliss acquired three light armored cars, eight medium armored cars, two motorcycles, and two trucks on 8 November 1928.[13]\\r\\nDuring World War II, Fort Bliss focused on training anti-aircraft artillery battalions (AAA). In September 1940 the Coast Artillery's anti-aircraft training center was established, and in 1941 the 1st Tow Target Squadron arrived to fly target drones[13] (the 6th, 19th, & 27th Tow Target Squadrons were at the nearby Biggs Field). On 3 August 1944, the Anti-Aircraft Artillery School was ordered from Camp Davis to Fort Bliss to make the training of anti-aircraft gunners easier, and they became the dominant force at Fort Bliss following the departure of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division.[13] On 15 Sept. 1942, the War Dept. made space available for handling up to 1,350 POWs, while POW camps could be constructed.[24] During the war, the base was used to hold approximately 91 German and Italian Americans and Japanese from Hawaii (then a territory), who were arrested as potential fifth columnists but, in most cases, denied due process.[25]\\r\\nBy February 1946, over 100 Operation Paperclip German scientists had arrived to develop rockets and were attached to the Office of the Chief of Ordnance Corps, Research and Development Service, Suboffice (Rocket), headed by Major James P. Hamill.[27] Although the scientists were initially \\"pretty much kept on ice\\" (resulting in the nickname \\"Operation Icebox\\"),[27] they were subsequently divided into a research group and a group who assisted with V-2 test launches at White Sands Proving Grounds.[28] German families began arriving in December 1946,[27] and by the spring of 1948, the number of German rocket specialists (nicknamed \\"Prisoners of Peace\\") in the US was 127.[27] Fort Bliss rocket launches included firings of the Private missile at the Hueco Range in April 1945.[29] In 1953, funding cuts caused the cancellation of work on the Hermes B2 ramjet work that had begun at Fort Bliss.[30]\\r\\nIn late 1953 after troops had been trained at the Ft Bliss Guided Missile School, field-firing operations of the MGM-5 Corporal were underway at Red Canyon Range Camp, WSPG.[31]:263 In April 1950, the 1st Guided Missile Group named the Republic-Ford JB-2 the ARMY LOON.[31]:249\\r\\nFort Bliss trained thousands of U.S. Soldiers during the Cold War. As the United States gradually came to master the art of building and operating missiles, Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range became more and more important to the country, and were expanded accordingly. On 1 July 1957 the U.S. Army Air Defense Center was established at Fort Bliss. Located at this Center, in addition to Center Headquarters, are the U.S. Army Air Defense School; Air Defense; the 6th Artillery Group (Air Defense); the 61st Ordnance Group; and other supporting elements.[32][33] In 1957 Fort Bliss and its anti-aircraft personnel began using Nike Ajax, Nike Hercules, Hawk, Sprint, Chaparral, and Redeye missiles.[13][34] Fort Bliss took on the important role of providing a large area for troops to conduct live fire exercises with the missiles.\\r\\nBecause of the large number of Army personnel enrolled in the air defense school, Fort Bliss saw two large rounds of construction in 1954 and 1958. The former was aimed at creating more barracks facilities, while the latter was aimed at building new classrooms, materials labs, a radar park, and a missile laboratory.[13] Between 1953 and 1957 the Army also expanded McGregor Range in an effort to accommodate live fire exercises of the new missile systems.[13] Throughout the Cold War Fort Bliss remained a premier site for testing anti-aircraft equipment.\\r\\nFort Bliss was used as the Desert Stage of the Ranger School training course to prepare Ranger School graduates for operations in the deserts of the Middle East. From 1983 to 1987, Fort Bliss was home to the Ranger School's newly formed 4th (Desert Ranger) Training Company. This unit was later expanded in 1987 to form the newly created Ranger Training Brigade's short-lived 7th Ranger Training Battalion, which was then transferred to the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah. The deserts of Utah proved to be unsuitable so the 7th Ranger Training Battalion was returned to Fort Bliss from 1991 until the Ranger School's Desert Phase was discontinued in 1995.\\r\\nWhile the United States Army Air Defense Artillery School develops doctrine and tactics, training current and future soldiers has always been its core mission. Until 1990 the post was used for Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training (AIT), under the 1/56 ADA Regiment, part of 6th ADA. Before 1989, 1/56 had three basic training companies and two AIT batteries. After 1990, 1/56 dropped basic training, that mission assumed by Fort Sill. The unit now had four enlisted batteries for enlisted AIT, one battery for the Officer's Basic Course and Captain's Career Course (added in 2004) and one company that trained army truck drivers (MOS 88M).\\r\\nIn 1995, the Department of Defense recommended that the U.S. 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment be relocated to Fort Carson, Colorado. Efforts to consolidate units from another post with those units that remained at Fort Bliss were overruled by the Base Realignment and Closing Commission, leaving Fort Bliss without any armored vehicles. Units operating the US Army's MIM-104 Patriot Missile Defense System relocated to Fort Bliss during the 1990s. The Patriot system played an important role in the Persian Gulf War/Operation Desert Storm in 1991. In commemoration, the US 54 expressway in northeast El Paso was designated the Patriot Freeway.\\r\\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, Fort Bliss provided ADA Battalions for US and NATO use in Afghanistan and Iraq, and has served as one of the major deployment centers for troops bound for Iraq and Afghanistan. This mission is accomplished via nearby Biggs Army Airfield, which is included in the installation's supporting areas. Following the War in Afghanistan (2001ÿpresent) in 2001 Fort Bliss began training Afghan security forces at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy at Fort Bliss, with the hope that these newly trained soldiers would eventually be able to take control of their own national security.\\r\\nIn 2005, the Pentagon recommended transforming Fort Bliss into a heavy armor training post, to include approximately 11,500 new troops from the U.S. 1st Armored Division ÿ at that time stationed in Germany -, as well as units from Fort Sill and Fort Hood.[35] An estimated 15,918 military jobs and 384 civilian jobs were planned to be transferred to Fort Bliss, brought the total number of troops stationed at Fort Bliss under this alignment to a total of 33,500 by 2012.[36] Officials from Fort Bliss and the City of El Paso were thrilled with the decision; the general mood of the city government was perfectly captured by 14 May edition of the El Paso Times, which boldly proclaimed \\"BLISS WINS BIG\\".[37]\\r\\nAccording to Senator Eliot Shapleigh, the BRAC commission considered three primary factors to make its decision: The military value of Fort Bliss, the potential for other branches of the armed service to use a post as large as Fort Bliss, and the lack of urban encroachment around Fort Bliss that would otherwise hinder its growth.[35] The arrival of the 11,500 troops from the 1st Armored Division is also expected to create some 20,196 direct and indirect military and civilian jobs in El Paso. According to the Department of Defense, this is the largest net gain in the United States tied to the Base Realignment and Closure recommendations. Of the 20,196 new jobs expected to come to El Paso as a result of Bliss realignment 9,000 would be indirect civilian jobs created by the influx of soldiers to the \\"Sun City\\". When the BRAC commission recommendations were released Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison's spokesman reported that El Paso was the only area that came out with a major gain of forces.[38]\\r\\nThe news that El Paso had been selected to receive major elements of the 1st Armored Division was met with joy, but at the same time many expressed surprise at the panel's recommendation to transfer the Air Defense Artillery School, 6th ADA Brigade, and its accompanying equipment (including the MIM-104 Patriot Missile Anti-Aircraft/Anti Missile defense system) to Fort Sill.[37] On 25 August officials representing Fort Bliss went before the BRAC Commission to plead their case for maintaining the ADA school and its accompanying equipment at Fort Bliss, citing among other thing the size of Fort Bliss and the history of the ADA school in the region.[1] The BRAC Commission ultimately ruled against Fort Bliss,[39] and the roughly 4,500 affected soldiers were transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The entire transfer of soldiers to and from Fort Bliss was completed no later than 15 September 2011.[1]\\r\\nOn 25 June 2009, authority over the post was shifted from Training and Doctrine Command to Forces Command.[40]\\r\\nAmong Fort Bliss' missions:\\r\\nTraining missions are supported by the McGregor Range Complex, located some 25 miles (40?km) to the northeast of the main post, in New Mexico. Most of Fort Bliss lies in the state of New Mexico, stretching northeastward along U.S. Route 54 from El Paso County, Texas to the southern boundary of the Lincoln National Forest in Otero County, New Mexico; in addition, much of the northwestward side of Highway 54 is part of the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, ranging from the northern side of Chaparral, New Mexico to the southern boundary of White Sands Missile Range;[47] the main facilities are within the city limits of El Paso, Texas. According to the city zoning map, the post officially resides in Central El Paso.\\r\\nFort Bliss K-12 Schools\\r\\nBliss Elementary\\r\\nLogan Elementary\\r\\nMilam Elementary\\r\\nColin Powell Elementary\\r\\nChapin High[48]\\r\\nSeparate from the main post are the William Beaumont Army Medical Center (which also serves the warrior transition battalion for the post's wounded warriors) and a Department of Veterans Affairs center at the eastern base of the Franklin Mountains. All of these supporting missions serve the military and retired-military population here, including having served General Omar N. Bradley in his last days. A new warrior transition complex, located at Marshall and Cassidy roads, was opened in June 2011 to replace the older facility serving the warrior transition battalion.\\r\\nThe installation is also close to the El Paso Airport (with easy access from the post via Robert E. Lee Roadsoon to be renamed Buffalo Soldier Road),[49] Highway 54, and Interstate 10. There is a replica of the Magoffinsville site for Fort Bliss on post, simulating the adobe style of construction.[50] Other items of interest include the Buffalo Soldier memorial statue on Buffalo Soldier Road, at the Buffalo Soldier Gate of entry to the post, and a missile museum on Pleasanton Road.\\r\\nThe walls of the old Fort Bliss Officers Club contains adobe bricks that are more than a century old. The building now houses a Family Readiness Group, where new personnel can learn about the post's activities and support groups. The Fort Bliss Welcome center, for new arrivals, is nearby, in the Building 500 area.\\r\\nFort Bliss has been designated a \\"No Drone Zone\\" by the FAA, out to 400 feet beyond the lateral edges of the military reservation. This will be enforced by the Military Police.[51]\\r\\nAs of 2005, the base contributed about $1.7 billion[38] to the economy of Central El Paso and Northeast El Paso, and many businesses in the region serve the post's troops. When troops are transferred to other posts or called up for service overseas, the economic fallout can be felt throughout the city. Following the departure of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment in 1995, many businesses in the Central and Northeast parts of the city either closed or moved.[citation needed] Conversely, the influx of troops from the 1st Armored Division led to a boom in construction of housing and schools in the Central and Northeast areas of El Paso.[specify]\\r\\nAs the Army began downsizing in 2014, Fort Bliss was expected to lose 1,200 soldiers from the then-current 33,500 by 2017.[36]\\r\\nFort Bliss has also assisted El Paso during local disasters. In 1897, and again in 1925, the fort provided food and housing to those displaced by flood waters.[13] In 2006, Fort Bliss dispatched soldiers and helicopters to the flood-affected areas to help with rescue efforts there. [52] The flooding of El Paso in 2013 and 2014 were not met with this type of official response.\\r\\nAs of July 2010, electric power consumption at Fort Bliss had been reduced by three megawatts as the base continues to work towards becoming a \\"net zero\\" energy installation.[53] In April 2013, Major General Dana J.H. Pittard, USA, announced a $120 million project to be completed by 2015, consisting of the largest solar farm within the U.S. military.[54][55]\\r\\nA joint study by Fort Bliss and El Paso-area city governments found that desalination was a viable method for increasing El Paso's water supply by 25%.[56] The Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant, on Montana Avenue, is located on Fort Bliss property, and desalinates the groundwater of the Hueco Bolson for use by El Paso and Fort Bliss. This reverse-osmosis plant protects the fresh groundwater supplies from invasion by more brackish water.[57] This plant is currently the largest non-seawater desalination plant in the world.\\r\\nIn 2010, with the assumption of command by Major General Dana J.H. Pittard, a local that grew up in El Paso, Fort Bliss was made an \\"open post\\" which allowed anyone with a valid driver's license to enter the post.[58] As of 2015 Fort Bliss is no longer an open post.\\r\\nThe Fort Bliss census-designated place is located at 314807N 1062529W? / ?31.801847N 106.424608W? / 31.801847; -106.424608.[59] According to the United States Census Bureau, the census-designated place has a total area of 6.2?square miles (16.0?km2), all of it land. In terms of its United States physiographic region, it is a southern part of the Basin and Range Province.\\r\\nAn investigation into above-ground dirt-covered bunkers located on the military reservation was opened in June 2013. These former nuclear weapons bunkers were used by the Air Force during the Cold War, when Biggs Air Force Base was a SAC base. Low level radiation was detected in Bunker 11057. The bunker interiors were previously painted with epoxy paint to contain the radiation, and the paint has now chipped. The radiation contamination is confined to the area around the bunker. The area was closed on 11 July 2013.[60]\\r\\nAs of the census[61] of 2000, there were 8,264 people, 1,527 households, and 1,444 families residing on the post. The population density was 1,340.1 people per square mile (517.1/km2). There were 2,309 housing units at an average density of 374.4/sq?mi (144.5/km2). The racial makeup of the post was 58.1% White, 25.1% African American, 2.4% Asian, 1.3% Native American, 0.7% Pacific Islander, 8.9% from other races, and 3.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 19.3% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 1,527 households out of which 80.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 84.5% were married couples living together, 8.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 5.4% were non-families. 4.9% of all households were made up of individuals and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.54 and the average family size was 3.62.\\r\\nOn the post the population was spread out with 29.3% under the age of 18, 33.6% from 18 to 24, 34.7% from 25 to 44, 2.3% from 45 to 64, and 0.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years. For every 100 females there were 167.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 204.8 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household on the post was $35,970, and the median income for a family was $34,679. Males had a median income of $19,920 versus $17,227 for females. The per capita income for the post was $13,201. About 9.5% of families and 11.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.5% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nThe Replica Museum is located next to the Noel Parade Field and depicts the Post at the Magoffinsville site. This five building museum was authentically constructed with adobe bricks and painted stucco, and includes a sutler store, bunkhouse, blacksmith shop, saddlery and a pottery kiln. The museum depicts the story of Fort Bliss and El Paso from 1848 to 1948 and was dedicated on the 100th anniversary.\\r\\nThe Fort Bliss and Ironsides Museums are located next to the Athletic Field and includes outdoor and indoor exhibits.

Bell and Lee Phillip Bell for CBS. The show is set in a fictional Wisconsin town called Genoa City, which is unlike and unrelated to the real life village of the same name, Genoa City, Wisconsin.[2] First broadcast on March 26, 1973, The Young and the Restless was originally broadcast as half-hour episodes, five times a week.[3][4] The show expanded to one-hour episodes on February 4, 1980.[5] In 2006, the series began airing encore episodes weeknights on SOAPnet[6] until 2013, when Y&R moved to TVGN (now Pop). Pop still airs the encore episodes on weeknights, starting July 1, 2013.[7][8]  The series is also syndicated internationally.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Young and the Restless originally focused on two core families: the wealthy Brooks family and the working class Foster family.[3] After a series of recasts and departures in the early 1980s, all the original characters except Jill Foster and Katherine Chancellor were written out. Bell replaced them with the new core families, the Abbotts and the Williamses.[3] Over the years, other families such as the Newmans, Winters, and the Baldwin-Fishers were introduced.[10][11] Despite these changes, one storyline that has endured through almost the show's entire run is the feud between Jill Abbott and Katherine Chancellor, the longest rivalry on any American soap opera.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its debut, The Young and the Restless has won nine Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series. It is also currently the highest-rated daytime drama on American television. As of 2008, it had appeared at the top of the weekly Nielsen ratings in that category for more than 1,000 weeks since 1988.[14] As of December 12, 2013, according to Nielsen ratings, The Young and the Restless was the leading daytime drama for an unprecedented 1,300 weeks, or 25 years.[15] The serial is also a sister series to The Bold and the Beautiful, as several actors have crossed over between shows. In June 2017, The Young and the Restless was renewed for three additional years.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo compete with the youthful ABC soap operas, All My Children, One Life to Live, and General Hospital, CBS executives wanted a new daytime serial that was youth oriented.[16] William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell created The Young and the Restless in 1972 for the network under the working title, The Innocent Years![16][17] \\"We were confronted with the very disturbing reality that young America had lost much of its innocence,\\" Bell said. \\"Innocence as we had known and lived it all our lives had, in so many respects, ceased to exist.\\"[18] They changed the title of the series to The Young and the Restless because they felt it \\"reflected the youth and mood of the early seventies.\\"[18]  The Bells named the fictional setting for the show after the real Genoa City, Wisconsin, which was located on their way from their then-home in Chicago to their annual summer vacation spot in Lake Geneva.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Young and the Restless began airing on March 26, 1973, replacing the cancelled soap opera, Where the Heart Is.[5] Bell worked as head writer from the debut of the series until his retirement in 1998.[19] He wrote from his home in Chicago while production took place in Los Angeles, California. Originally, Bell wanted to shoot the series in New York, however, CBS executives felt that Los Angeles would be more cost effective.[9] John Conboy acted as the show's first executive producer, staying in the position until 1982.[5] Bell and H. Wesley Kenney became co-executive producers that year until Edward Scott took over in 1989. Bell then became senior executive producer.[5] Other executive producers included David Shaughnessy,[20] John F. Smith,[21] Lynn Marie Latham,[22] Josh Griffith,[23] Maria Arena Bell, and Paul Rauch.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-1980s, Bell and his family moved to Los Angeles to create a new soap opera.[9] During this time, his three children, William Jr., Bradley, and Lauralee Bell, each became involved in soap operas. Lauralee Bell worked as an actress on The Young and the Restless. Bradley Bell co-created The Bold and the Beautiful with his father. William Bell Jr. became involved in the family's production companies as president of Bell Dramatic Serial Co. and Bell-Phillip Television Productions Inc.[9] \\"It's worked out very well for us because we really all worked in very different aspects of the show,\\" William Bell Jr. said. \\"With my father and I, it was a great kind of partnership and pairing in the sense that he had a total control of the creative side of the show and I didn't have even the inclination to interject in what he was doing.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter William J. Bell's 1998 retirement, a number of different head writers took over the position, including Kay Alden, Trent Jones, John F. Smith, Lynn Marie Latham, Scott Hamner, Josh Griffith, Maria Arena Bell, and Hogan Sheffer.[20][21][22][23][24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, former General Hospital executive producer Jill Farren Phelps was hired as the new executive producer of the soap, replacing Bell. Griffith was also named the sole head writer.[27] On August 15, 2013, it was speculated and reported by several online sources that Griffith had resigned as head-writer of the serial.[28][29] Further speculation adds that Shelly Altman may take over as the new scribe, alongside Tracey Thomson or Jean Passanante may be brought aboard as co-head scribe.[30][31] On September 12, 2013, it was announced that Passanante and Altman were named head writers of the show, with Thomson promoted to co-head writer.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 18, 2014, former All My Children, Santa Barbara and General Hospital head writer Charles Pratt, Jr. was named as the new head writer of the show. Passanante, Altman and Thomson have been demoted to breakdown writers. Pratt was also named as co-executive producer sharing the credit with Phelps.[33] On June 7, 2016, Serial Scoop announced that Phelps had been terminated from her position as executive producer; a replacement was not named at the time of their reporting.[34] The following morning, Sony Pictures Television confirmed to several media outlets that Phelps had been let go from her position; British television producer Mal Young was announced as Phelps' replacement.[35] Phelps' last appearance as executive producer was July 12, 2016, while Young's first appearance occurred the following day on July 13.[36] On September 13, 2016, it was announced that Pratt was named as executive producer and show-runner of Lee Daniels' Star.[37][38] The same day, Daytime Confidential revealed that former Generations and Days of Our Lives head writer Sally Sussman, who previously had positions with the show, such as Associate Head Writer, was in-talks to replace Pratt as Head Writer.[39] On September 15, 2016, it was confirmed that Sussman was named as the soap's new head writer.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 21, 2016, Daytime Confidential reported that after ten years since leaving the soap, Alden had been re-hired to be a story consultant under Sussman's regime.[42] Sussman's tenure as head writer began taping on October 20, 2016, and began airing on December 7, 2016.[43] On June 20, 2017, CBS announced its decision to renew the serial for three years.[44][45] On July 31, 2017, it was announced that both Alden and Sussman would retire from their positions; Young was named as Sussman's successor as head writer.[46][47] Sussman last aired as head writer on October 24, 2017. Young's tenure as head writer aired on October 25, 2017.[48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nTaped at CBS Television City, studios 41 and 43 in Hollywood since its debut on March 26, 1973,[50] the show was packaged by the distribution company Columbia Pictures Television, which has now been replaced by Sony Pictures Television.[4][51] The Young and the Restless originally aired as a half-hour series on CBS and was the first soap opera to focus on the visual aspects of production, creating \\"a look that broke with the visual conventions of the genre.\\"[3][4] Similar to the radio serials that had preceded them, soap operas at the time primarily focused on dialogue, characters, and story, with details like sets as secondary concerns.[3] The Young and the Restless stood out by using unique lighting techniques and camera angles, similar to Hollywood-style productions.[51][52] The style of videotaping included using out-of-the-ordinary camera angles and a large number of facial close-ups with bright lighting on the actors' faces.[3][51][52][53] Conboy said he used lighting to create \\"artistic effects\\".[52] Those effects made the series look dark, shadowy, and moody.[3][52] The Young and the Restless' look influenced the taping styles of other soap operas.[3] When H. Wesley Kenney replaced Conboy as executive producer, he balanced the lighting of the scenes.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the success of the series, CBS and their affiliates pressured Bell to lengthen the series from 30 minutes to a full hour. Bell attributed this change to the show's fall from number one in the Nielsen ratings, since the lengthening of the show led to the departure of a number of cast members.[3] \\"The issue of performing in a one-hour show had not been part of their contracts,\\" Bell said.[3] This forced the show to recast multiple main characters and eventually phase out the original core families in favor of new ones.[3]  The show expanded to one hour on February 4, 1980.  It airs at 12:30pm ET/11:00am CT/PT, although some stations opt to air it at 11:30am CT.\\r\\n\\r\\nExteriors used in the late 1980s and early 1990s (and reused years later) included locations in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, including Allegheny General Hospital, One Oxford Centre, the Duquesne Club, Hampton Township and the prison. Phillip Chancellor died in the Richland, Pennsylvania area, where the police chief was not told and believed the accident really happened.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 27, 2001, The Young and the Restless became the first daytime soap opera to be broadcast in high-definition.[55] In September 2011, its sister soap The Bold and the Beautiful became the last soap to make the transition from SD to HD before One Life to Live ended its ABC run on January 13, 2012 and began its TOLN run online on April 29, 2013. On April 24, 2006, SoapNet began airing same-day episodes of the series.[6] The final airing on SoapNet was on June 28, 2013. The soap has moved from SoapNet to TV Guide Network.[56] The same day episodes begin airing on TVGN (now Pop) weeknights on July 1, 2013.[57][58]\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-creators William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell centered The Young and the Restless around two core families, the wealthy Brooks' and the poor Fosters.[3][16][18] Bell borrowed this technique of soap opera building from his mentor, Irna Phillips.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile casting for the series, Bell and executive producer John Conboy auditioned 540 actors for the 13 main characters.[59] They assembled the youngest group of actors ever cast on a soap opera at the time, hiring mostly unknown actors[60] who they considered \\"glamorous model types\\".[51] Chemistry between actors also factored into the criteria for casting.[52] The stories focused on the younger characters, with an emphasis in fantasy.[3][18] The fantasy element was reflected in the love story between Jill Foster and the millionaire Phillip Chancellor II; the Leslie Brooks, Brad Elliot, and Lorie Brooks love triangle; and Snapper Foster's romance with Chris Brooks.[3][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nSexuality also played a major role in the stories.[3][51][53] Formerly, soap operas did not delve into the sexual side of their romances. Bell changed that, first during his time as head writer of Days of Our Lives and again on The Young and the Restless.[51] William Gray Espy's Snapper Foster is considered the \\"first to discover sex on a soap opera.\\"[53] During the story, the character is engaged to Chris Brooks (Trish Stewart) and having a sexual relationship with Sally McGuire (Lee Crawford).[53] Other plots reflected sexual themes as well. For the first time in the genre, the dialogue and the story situations included explicit sexual themes such as premarital intercourse, impotence, incest, and rape.[3] The first two rape storylines that would be told on the serial were controversial at the time as they reflected a more introspective and analytic storytelling style, the first time rape storylines would be addressed in this manner in the genre.[61] The first, in 1973-74, revolved around the rape of Chris Brooks and the aftermath, in which she entertained (and, eventually, rejected) the idea that she was perhaps at fault for her attack. The second, in 1976, involved Chris's sister Peggy (Pamela Peters Solow) and was meant to serve as a cut-and-dried story in which no viewer could justify this attack, committed out of the blue by an authority figure.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series also explored social issues. Jennifer Brooks underwent the first mastectomy on a soap opera.[52] Other social issue storylines included bulimia, alcoholism, and cancer.[62] Lesbianism was also touched on with Katherine Chancellor, who flirts with Jill while drunk in 1974 and has a brief relationship with Joann Curtis (Kay Heberle) in 1977.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the series lengthened from a half-hour to an hour in 1980, multiple cast members who portrayed characters from the original core families departed because their contracts only bound them to performing in a half-hour show.[3] A number of the characters were recast until one of the few remaining original actors, Jaime Lyn Bauer, who portrayed Lorie Brooks, decided to leave. When she announced her intention not to renew her contract, Bell decided to replace the original core families.[3] \\"As I studied the remaining cast, I realized I had two characters- Paul Williams, played by Doug Davidson, and Jack Abbott, played by Terry Lester- both of whom had a relatively insignificant presence on the show,\\" Bell said. \\"They didn't have families. Hell, they didn't even have bedrooms. But these became the two characters I would build our two families around.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe characters from the Abbott and Williams families were integrated into the series while the Brooks and Foster families, with the exception of Jill, were phased out. The continuity of the feud between Jill and Katherine, which began in the early years of the show, smoothed the transition.[3] The relationship between the two characters remained a central theme throughout the series and became the longest lasting rivalry in daytime history.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother character introduced in the 1980s was Eric Braeden's Victor Newman.[3][10] Originally, the character was \\"a despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser\\" who was intended to be killed off.[10] Braeden's tenure on the show was meant to last between eight and twelve weeks. \\"When I saw Eric Braeden's first performance- the voice, the power, the inner strength- I knew immediately that I didn't want to lose this man,\\" Bell said. \\"He was exactly what the show needed. Not the hateful man we saw on-screen, but the man he could and would become.\\"[10] Bell rewrote the story to save the character and put Braeden on contract. Victor's romance with Nikki Reed became a prominent plot in the series.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the success of another iconic character, Kimberlin Brown's Sheila Carter, Bell made daytime drama history in 1992 by successfully crossing her over from The Young and the Restless to his second soap, The Bold and the Beautiful. The success of the crossover was due, in part, to the creativity of Bell, as the nefarious character of Sheila was presumed to have died in a fire on The Young and the Restless.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, core black characters were introduced with the Barber and Winters families. Victoria Rowell (Drucilla Barber) and Tonya Lee Williams (Dr. Olivia Barber) were cast as the nieces of the Abbott's maid, Mamie Johnson, in 1990.[63] The brothers Neil (Kristoff St. John) and Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore) were introduced as love interests for Olivia and Drucilla.[11] The Young and the Restless became popular among black viewers, which Williams and St. John attributed to the writing for the black characters.[11][64][65] \\"I play a CEO at a major corporation, that's something we don't see that often,\\" St. John said. \\"And the show doesn't use the old African-American stereotypes that we have been seeing on TV, like the hustler, the pimp, the drug dealer. We have come a long way.\\"[64] Though the characters held prominent positions in the fictional work place of Genoa City, they had little interaction with other characters outside of their jobs.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nHead writers\\r\\n\\r\\nThe serial has won 116 Daytime Emmys, among 360 nominations. The following list summarizes awards won by The Young and the Restless:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Belize, Channel 5 Great Belize Television airs the soap, while rival Channel 7 Tropical Vision Limited also airs the soap.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, the Global Television Network airs new episodes a day ahead of the US broadcast. Most Global stations use The Young and the Restless as a late-afternoon lead-in for their local newscasts,[citation needed] but times vary by market. It also airs on NTV in Newfoundland and Labrador which airs the program on a same-day-as-CBS basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Jamaica, the show airs on CVMTV.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Trinidad, the show airs weekdays on CBS and has been airing in Trinidad since the 1980s. In 1988, 70 percent of Trinidadians who had access to a television watched daily episodes of The Young and the Restless, a series that emphasized family problems, sexual intrigue, and gossip.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia, The Young and the Restless airs after Days of Our Lives on Arena. It previously aired on the Nine Network from April 1, 1974 to February 23, 2007, before joining the W line-up on April 2, 2007, to August 17, 2012, On July 20, 2012, it was announced that the show would move to Arena on August 20, 2012, after W rebranded as SoHo. Episodes are approximately one week behind those airing in the US at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New Zealand, The Young and the Restless aired alongside Days  of Our Lives on TV ONE and ended on November 6, 2009.  The soap was approximately four seasons behind the CBS season due to being preempted by holiday and sporting programming.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Philippines, aired from 1987 to 1989 on ABS-CBN.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, The Young and The Restless has aired on many TV channels starting in 1990, when episodes from 1987 debuted on BSB Galaxy in a regular weekday timeslot. When BSB merged with Sky in November 1990, the soap moved to Sky's flagship channel Sky One and aired at 11:00 weekdays until the end of 1992. When BSB's original three-year contract to air the soap expired, Sky chose not to renew it. In 1993, Y&R was picked up by UK Living (then known as simply Living, now Sky Living) in a primetime timeslot, picking up where Sky left off. This lasted until late 1995.  In 2007, Zone Romantica, now CBS Drama began broadcasting the show weekdays [four years behind US]. In 2009, when CBS went into partnership with and took over the Chellozone Channels the show was relegated to just one showing a day [in favor of repeating shows such as Dynasty and Dallas in the daytime]. It was attracting around 18ÿ20,000 viewers at midnight in the last week of its broadcast in the UK in August 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Italy The Young and the Restless aired from february 1983 to february 1984 on Italia Uno, from october 1984 to june 1995 on Rete 4, in the summer of 1995 on Canale 5 and from april 1998 to october 2009 again on Rete 4. They were shown US episodes from autumn 1979 to march 1986, from november 1989 to december 1993 and from november 1998 to january 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn India, the show began airing in February 2007 on Zee Caf. The channel started with episodes from 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn South Africa, the show airs on e.tv. The show was originally aired in South Africa in the early 1990s, dubbed into the Afrikaans language, and entitled 'Rustelose Jare' (Restless Years). In 1999 The Young and the Restless was canceled but the show returned to South African television screens in June 2004, with no overhead foreign translations. As of June 2014, episodes are screened nine months behind the US. Because of \\"continual viewing\\" with no breaks, South African audiences will catch up with the US broadcast by mid-2016.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Nadia's Theme\\" has been the theme music of The Young and the Restless since the show's debut in 1973.[5][9] The melody, originally titled \\"Cotton's Dream\\", was composed by Barry De Vorzon and Perry Botkin, Jr.  for the 1971 theatrical film Bless the Beasts and Children. The melody was later renamed \\"Nadia's Theme\\" after the ABC television network's sports summary program Wide World of Sports lent the music for a montage of Romanian gymnast Nadia Com?neci's routines during the 1976 Summer Olympics;[108] despite the title, Nadia never performed her floor exercises using this piece of music. Instead, she used a piano arrangement of a medley of the songs \\"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\\" and \\"Jump in the Line.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBotkin wrote a rearranged version of the piece specifically for The Young and the Restless' debut.[9] The song remained unchanged, save for a slight remix in 1988 and a three-year stint in the early 2000s (decade), when an alternate, more jazzy arrangement of that tune was used, using portions of the longer closing version of the original theme.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn LP album was published in 1976 by A&M Records. The track list contains two titles of the French composer Michel Colombier, Rainbow and Emmanuel, a success track[clarification needed] which he wrote in memory of the death of his son.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late September and early October 2012, upon the show's 10,000th episode, the current form of opening credits were updated. In the years prior, fans criticized them for their lack of updates and cast additions (some contract players, such as Adrienne Frantz, and Kimberlin Brown came and went without being added).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mid-February 2017, the current form of opening credits were updated to honor the history on CBS Daytime and to carry them into the future as they approach the 44th anniversary.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2010, The Young and the Restless has managed over 1,000 consecutive weeks in the #1 spot for daytime dramas.[110]  On the week ending April 6, 2012, The Young and the Restless was watched by a new low of an average of 3,960,000 viewers for the week, beating its previous low of 4.209 million in October 2011, as well as being the only week to date below 4 million viewers.[111] Currently, the show is still the most-watched daytime drama; and for the season 2011ÿ12, has a household rating of 3.5, and 1.5 for the Women 18ÿ49 demographic.[112] As of 2008, the Tuesday episodes of The Young and the Restless on average is the most-watched daytime drama showing.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen introduced during the 1972ÿ73 season, the show was at the bottom of the ratings, but rose rapidly: ninth by 1974ÿ75 and third by 1975ÿ76. By 1988ÿ89 it had dethroned long-time leader General Hospital as the top-rated soap, a position it has held ever since. During the week of December 2, 2013, the series celebrated their twenty-fifth year as the number one daytime drama.[114] The Young and the Restless airs every weeknight on Pop, where it averaged 362,000 viewers from July to September 2013.[115]","input":"When did young and the restless first air?"},{"output":"the Jewish People's Council","context":"","input":"What international organization created the country of israel in 1948?"},{"output":"\\"Love Will Keep Us Together\\" by Captain & Tennille","context":"These are the Billboard magazine Hot 100 number one hits of 1975.

Two other ways to become eligible to race in the event are winning one of the three stages in the Monster Energy Open (a 50-lap race for drivers not eligible for the main event), or by winning the fan vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first running of the race was held in 1985 at Charlotte Motor Speedway (formerly Lowe's Motor Speedway) and has been run there every year except in 1986 when it was run at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Michael Waltrip became the first driver to win the All-Star race after transferring in from a qualifying race in 1996. Until 2001, the rule restricted only champions of the past five All Star Challenge events, but in 2005, the rule became the winners in the past ten years of either the NASCAR Cup Series or the All-Star Race. For 2015, the full-time drivers who have won a NASCAR Cup Series or All-Star Race are now exempt, regardless of when they won the race.  The Showdown was restricted to the top 50 drivers in either the final standings of the previous year or current standings in the current year. From 2000 to 2002, and again starting in 2015, two qualifying races (the \\"Showdown\\" currently) are implemented.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, Nextel, predecessor to Sprint, added a vote of race spectators, internet users and Sprint cellphone users to add one additional driver not in the field, but in the Showdown, and finishing on the lead lap, to the final starting field. Starting in 2008, the event's name featured the use of the edition of the race in Roman numerals, with the 2008 race's official name the \\"Sprint All-Star Race XXIV\\". Also, the fan entry driver was changed, with the new formula coming from those attending races up to that point, Sprint retail locations and double votes from Sprint subscribers. In 2014, the Showdown race was moved to the night preceding the All-Star Race.[1] To replace the event, Charlotte Motor Speedway president, Marcus Smith announced that qualifying for the All-Star Race will take place shortly before the main event.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe twelve race winners from the 1984 season participated in the inaugural running of The Winston at Charlotte Motor Speedway. The race was 70 laps with one pit stop required. It was held the day before the Coca-Cola 600. A $10,000 bonus was paid to the leader of Lap 20 for leading that lap.  Terry Labonte won that bonus.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom its first year, the unique moniker \\"The Winston\\" was adopted by sponsor R. J. Reynolds. Rather than referring to the event as a traditional \\"All star\\" race, no generic reference was included in the title. Due to limitations on television tobacco advertising, other races which involved tobacco title sponsorship utilized generic names on network television. For example, on ABC, the Winston 500 was called the \\"Talladega 500\\" and the Marlboro 500 was called the \\"Michigan 500.\\" Without a generic alternative, television and other media were forced to acknowledge Winston as the title sponsor, effectively skirting, and pushing the limits of tobacco advertising regulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe race moved to Atlanta International Raceway in 1986, with a 200 kilometer format of 83 laps (126.326 miles) on Mother's Day, a day typically avoided on the NASCAR calendar. Like its previous counterpart, green flag pit stops were mandatory, and only winners from the 1985 season were eligible. Only nine different drivers won a race in 1985, so the highest placed non-winner in final 1985 points, Geoffrey Bodine, was added to the field for an even 10 cars. A 100-lap (152.2 miles) consolation race for the rest of the drivers, the Atlanta Invitational was held the same day. It featured only thirteen participants, and was won by Benny Parsons. A lackluster crowd of only 18,500 attended the second edition of The Winston, with only twenty-three cars racing in the two races combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe race returned to Charlotte with a new 135-lap (202.5 mile), three-segment format which reflected on NASCAR's short-track roots. A new date was introduced, the weekend before the Coca-Cola 600, which gave teams a popular two weeks of festivities at what is generally considered most teams' home track. Live national television coverage on ABC would also be featured for the first of four years. This format consisted of a 75-lap first segment, with a mandatory green flag pit stop, a 50-lap second segment, and a 10-green flag lap final sprint. Each segment would be separated by a ten-minute break.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the race format, the method for choosing participants changed. The 20-driver field consisted of the past nineteen race winners, regardless of season. The remaining drivers would participate in a 100-lap, last-chance race, the Winston Open, with the winner advancing to the final starting position.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, qualifying for the starting lineup for The Winston changed to a three-lap time trial, with a two-tire pit stop in the middle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a pair of controversial dashes in the past three years which infuriated fans, the race was cut to two segments of 50 and 20 laps to prevent some of the reckless driving, giving the race its 70-lap total distance which would be used until 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ten-minute break was installed between segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo changes were made in qualification in 1991. First, automatic berths were given only to race-winning drivers and owners in 1990 and 1991 up until The Winston. Second, The Winston Open was reduced to 50 laps, with the winner automatically advancing to the Winston. To guarantee 20 cars in the Winston field, it would be filled out by the top finishers (e.g., 2nd, 3rd, etc.) in the Winston Open advancing to the main event until the field reached 20 cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nABC carried the race in 1990, with the Winston Open finish, and CBS carried both the Open and The Winston in 1991. In 1991, to add to the day of events, the NASCAR Legends Race was held on a quarter-mile oval paved between the Charlotte Motor Speedway quad-oval and pit area. Elmo Langley won the exhibition event featuring retired NASCAR champions and stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe race was moved up one day to Saturday night, and it moved to live coverage on The Nashville Network (now Spike TV). The Winston revived the controversial 10-lap shootout, and The Winston Open went to a short 30-lap format. The 1992 race marked the first superspeedway race held under-the-lights, and resulted in a spectacular finish. Davey Allison and Kyle Petty battled on the last lap, and crashing crossing the finish line. Allison won the race, but spent the evening in the hospital rather than victory lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1994 was the only running won by a tire brand (Hoosier) other than Goodyear, as Geoff Bodine held off Sterling Marlin and Ken Schrader.  The event's second segment saw numerous crashes, notably when Ernie Irvan wrecked coming to the yellow to end the second segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1995 race featured Dale Earnhardt's trend-setting Special paint scheme car.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe field would be inverted after the first segment, and like the previous years, a 10-minute break would be featured between segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer NASCAR Champions were automatically invited to the race, as were the past five years' winners of this race.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Michael Waltrip's win by being the last car to transfer from The Winston Open, NASCAR changed the procedure by reverting to a format featuring the 1996 and 1997 race winning drivers and owners, and then adding the preceding year's race winning drivers not yet in the field until the field reached 19, and then the winner of The Winston Open. If the number added to the previous year reached over 19, then all drivers who won races that year would be in the field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe race remained at its 70 lap format, but for 1998, only green flag laps would count in any segment, not just the third segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second ten-minute break was eliminated and replaced with caution laps, and cars would have the option of pitting for tires and fuel, at the expense of losing track position.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inversion is changed to a random draw between 3 and 12 cars for the inversion after the first segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, qualifying for The Winston Open was changed. Previously it was accomplished with one-lap qualifying runs. From 1998 to 2000, the No Bull 25 Shootout twin races determined the lineups. Practice speeds (odd/even) from earlier in the day set the field for two 25-lap sprint races. The finish order for the first 25 set the odd positions for the Winston Open, and the finish order for the second 25 set the even positions for the Winston Open. In 2001, The Winston Open reverted to single-car qualifying, best of two laps.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000ÿ2002, immediately following The Winston Open, a 16-lap \\"No Bull 5 Sprint\\" last-chance race was added. The winner of the sprint race would also advance to The Winston.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, television coverage moved to FX as part of the new NASCAR television contract, and qualifying was changed so the pit stop took place at the start of the qualifying, and the stop was a four-tire change instead of two.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 2001, crew members were introduced together with drivers during the driver introduction ceremonies, with Fox broadcasters Chris Myers and Jeff Hammond interviewing selected persons during the ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popularity of the reality show Survivor influenced Winston to make changes to the format in 2002, adding a new elimination format (\\"Survival of the Fastest\\"), and the final segment returned to 20 laps to make tire wear an issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly race winning drivers and owners from 2001 would be in the field, and all former Cup titleholders and the past five winners of The Winston would be added to the field, plus the winner of the qualifying races.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe No Bull Sprint was eliminated after 2002, and for 2003, The Winston Open would become a 20-lap race with pit stops, and then a 10 green flag lap sprint after pit stops.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the caution flag waved on Lap 40 of the first segment, two green flag laps or the next yellow flag would be run to finish the segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Winston, only the top 20 cars advanced to the second segment, and 10 cars (in 2002) or 14 cars (in 2003 planned, but was 12 after crashes) advanced to the third segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA green flag pit stop for four tires was mandatory in the first segment, but after Frank Stoddard beat the system in 2002 by changing four tires on the car driven by Jeff Burton just feet from the finish line on the last lap, the rule was changed to mandating tire stops at a specific point in the race.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the inversion is moved to the final 20 lap sprint, and the ten-minute break is restored between the second and final segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Nextel took over title series title sponsorship from RJ Reynolds in 2004, the race name was changed using the established unofficial \\"All-Star\\" moniker which fans had been using for years without referring to the Winston cigarette sponsorship, officially becoming The Nextel All-Star Challenge. The format was changed slightly while the race stayed at 90 laps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elimination was eliminated, 1998ÿ2001 inversion and second segment to third segment break rules were restored, meaning a random inversion and an open pit road for the final break instead of a ten-minute break.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four tire stop is now between Laps 13 and 16.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting with the 2007 race, held May 19, 2007, there were major changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnounced during the Media Tour in Charlotte on January 23, 2007, the annual Pit Crew Challenge, held May 16, 2007, at Charlotte Bobcats Arena, won by Ryan Newman's crew in 2007, not only gave each member of the crew $10,000 each, but gave the driver the first choice of pit box, instead of the usual post-qualifying selection.  The unique three-lap qualifying (with a pit stop to change four tires) remained in place to determine the starting lineup, with $50,000 for the winner, $10,000 for second, and $5,000 for third, with the pit crew receiving half of the winner's share.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree drivers from the Nextel Open event, a 40-lap race with two 20-lap segments, gained entry to the Challenge.  The top two finishers of the Open plus the leading fan vote winner still on the lead lap joined the automatic entries from past decade's All-Star race winners and active Cup Champions, along with the winners of the previous year's and first eleven Nextel Cup races of the current season.  Winners of those first eleven races in that season were also eligible for the following season's All-Star event.  In addition, as part of NASCAR's new television agreements, coverage was moved from FX to Fox sibling network Speed. The race format also changed as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main race was shortened to eighty laps with four twenty-lap segments (or \\"quarters\\" like in football or basketball; only green flag laps will count in the final quarter).  After the first segment, a five-lap caution period starts and there is an opportunity for drivers to take an optional pit stop.  After the second segment, there is a ten-minute \\"halftime\\" break so pit crews can make adjustments. Unlike past events though, there is no inversion of the field. Finally, after the third segment, there is a five lap caution period so team can make a required pit stop (for work on their cars or a \\"stop and go\\" akin to a speeding penalty on pit row) for all teams which will determine the running order before the Dash for Cash, namely the $1 million (US) grand prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe changes to Sprint All-Star Race XXIV from XXIII was not only the name change with Roman numerials akin to the Super Bowl, and the first All-Star Race utilizing the Car of Tomorrow template, but also an expansion of the race by 25%.  Each quarter now had five more laps to race, which changes the complexion of each segment, as tire wear will become a greater factor as well as fuel milage would become more of an issue throughout the race.  The 2007 race with its 20-lap segments was treated more of a sprint race;  the 2008 race with 25-lap segments means a car will use nearly one-half tank of fuel and cycle the tires through one half of a tire run.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also changed the final pit stop as all cars must pit for fuel and tires since a stop and go during the mandatory pit stop will virtually be impossible because it would be very close to the limit (about 55ÿ60 laps) for fuel, and tire wear became an issue as cars are set up for a fairly long run.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe qualifying race also featured a name change, to the Sprint Showdown. All prize monies remained unchanged for this year's ra\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 25th anniversary of the race, two of the more popular elements of the classic format returned for this special edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first segment became a 50-lap quarter, with a mandatory pit stop taking place in Lap 25 of the segment, the pit stop must be a four-tire Stop and take place during a green flag condition.  Following the first two segments, cars will have the option of pitting, but they will lose track position should they do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second and third segments were twenty laps each, returning to the 2007 format.  Following the end of the third segment, a ten-minute break took place, allowing for adjustment of cars preceding the final segment,  a ten-green flag lap shootout.  The popularity of the double-file restarts throughout the race led NASCAR to adopt the rule for the second half of the 2009 season.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Segment: 50 Laps with a 4 tire pit stop on lap 25\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond Segment: 20 Laps/optional pit stops during the Caution\\r\\n\\r\\nThird Segment: 20 Laps followed by a ten-minute Break for adjustments/Mandatory 4 tire stop during Caution\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth Segment: 10 Laps in a Dash for the cash (No Caution Laps Count)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 28th running (XXVIII), run in 2012, came with a slight twist to the format.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time in the race's history, there were five segments run in the race, four of them for 20 laps and concluding with a 10-lap sprint. The format was changed to provide additional incentive to win one of the first four segments, as the four segment winners will line up 1ÿ4 to start the mandatory pit stop with the rest of the field lined up according to how they finished segment 4. Otherwise, the format, including eligibility criteria, remained unchanged. After winning the First Segment in 2012 Jimmie Johnson intentionally rode in the back for the next three segments. Matt Kenseth and Brad Keselowski did the same after winning Segments 2 and 3 respectively. Criticism to this practice resulted in the final segment pit stop changed from Segment winners to the drivers with the best average finish in Segments 1-4. The same year the pit stop was made for a mandatory 4-tire change. Track owner Bruton Smith promised a bonus million dollars if a driver could win all five segments. This has not been achieved yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, NASCAR changed qualifying from a single car two-lap run to a group qualifying effort with two (on short tracks and road courses) or three (On bigger tracks) rounds. All-Star Race qualifying remained the same. The Showdown was moved to Friday as well as the Fan Vote announcement so they can compete for practice and qualifying.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, NASCAR made a slight modification to the All-Star Race.  The ten-year rule for former Series and All-Star Race champions was replaced with a rule allowing a full-time driver who has won either to have a \\"lifetime\\" exemption provided they race full-time.  Also, for the Showdown, the \\"No Bull Sprint\\" format returned.  The first segment was 20 laps, then the winner advanced to the All-Star Race.  The second segment was 20 laps in which only Green Flag laps counted, that winner advanced.  The winners joined the Fan Vote winner, Danica Patrick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 5 segment format from 2012-2014 was kept with 5 Laps added to each segment for the All-Star Race, making each segment 25 laps. After the first four segments, drivers were lined up to enter pit road based on their average finish over the course of the first four segments. All drivers entered pit road for a mandatory 4-tire change before the final 10 lap segment in which only Green Flag laps counted.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnown as the \\"Brad Keselowski Rule\\" for the driver whose idea it was designed, the race would return, in its 30th year as a multi-segment race, to a three-segment format.  The first two segments were to be 50 laps, which would effectively require a pit stop in each segment (cars can make 50-55 laps per green flag run).  The pit stop had to be performed under green flag conditions and a two (or more) tire change is required. During the second segment, the stop had to be before lap 35.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the first segment, a minimum of two tires were required to be changed during the pit stop.  Following the end of the second segment, a random draw determined whether nine, ten, or eleven cars would be forced conduct a four-tire pit stop.  Those cars were required to line up behind the cars that did not pit. Cars below that mark could pit but had to line up after the cars that made a mandatory pit stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeselowski said the thirteen green flag lap segment was set because the NASCAR Drivers Council considered factors regarding pit stops and how many laps it would take to come back to the front, which would be around 10-15 laps, so 13 was chosen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Showdown and fan vote also changed for 2016.  In addition to the old \\"No Bull Sprint\\" format, a third segment of ten laps was added.  A two tire stop was required between segments.  The winner of each Showdown segment advanced to the All-Star Race, and skips the remaining two segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fan vote allowed two drivers to transfer the main event.  Originally scheduled for one driver voted by the fan vote, the rules called for a second in 2016 because of a quirk in the eligibility.  There were 16 drivers eligible for the All-Star Race, so the rules were designed so the three Showdown winners and the fan vote winner would make it 20.  With Jeff Gordon, eligible by the November 2015 Martinsville win, retired, the runner-up in the fan vote was chosen to advance.  If special circumstances warranted the withdrawal of another eligible driver, the third (and subsequent) placed driver in the fan vote would have also advanced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe practice of using Roman numerals to identify each race began in 2008, but ended one year later.\\r\\n\\r\\n2016:  Race postponed from Friday, May 20 to Saturday, May 21 because of inclement weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwin 25-lap races to determine the starting grid for the Winston Open. The starting lineups of the shootouts were based on practice speeds earlier in the day. In 2001, the starting grid for the Winston Open reverted to two-lap qualifying.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 1989, pole qualifying for race changed. During the three-lap run, teams are required to perform a four-tire pit stop on either the first or the second lap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough 1997, one-lap qualifying was utilized. From 1998 to 2000, a pair of qualifying races, the No Bull 25's, set the starting lineup. The use of one lap qualifying (best single lap of two) resumed in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NASCAR All-Star Race's roots are from the non-championship 1961ÿ1963 Race of Champions at Daytona International Speedway. A 10-lap, 25-mile All-Star event was held in conjunction with the Speedweeks activities. Like the first two runnings of the NASCAR All-Star Race, only winners of the previous season participated in this event.","input":"Who won the first nascar all star race?"},{"output":"Delphine Gibson","context":"This article includes lists of supercentenarians from the United States (people from the United States who have attained the age of at least 110 years).

Her age at death was 110?years, 93?days.[79] When Pouder was twelve years old, her family emigrated to the United States. There she lived the following 98 years of her life in Baltimore, Maryland. She married Nepalese American Citizen Alexander Poudar, although became a widow very early and had no children. Her extreme longevity claim was certified by Alexander Graham Bell.[80] In her last few months, she was bedridden, blind, and almost deaf, but her mind remained sharp.[81]\\r\\nFlorence Knapp (October 10, 1873 ÿ January 11, 1988) was, for the last two weeks of her life, recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest person in the world.[82]\\r\\nBorn in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, she lived in nearby Montgomery Square much of her life and came from a large and long-lived family, eight of her siblings dying in their 80s and 90s and one sister reaching age 108.\\r\\nBy October 1987, when she was honored by the Pennsylvania legislature, she was recognized by Guinness as the oldest person in the United States, and the death of Anna Eliza Williams on December 27, 1987, meant that Knapp became the oldest verified living person. Her death, aged 114 years 93 days, just 15 days after, meant that she never appeared in a Guinness Book as the oldest living person.\\r\\nHer death caused some confusion as to who her successor was, with Guinness recognition and press publicity alighting first on Orpha Nusbaum (August 1875 ÿ March 1988), who died before the 1989 edition's deadline, then Birdie May Vogt (August 1876 ÿ July 1989), who appeared in the 1989 edition's main text, then Jeanne Calment, mentioned in the addenda section, and finally in November 1988 on Carrie C. White, whose claim to birth in November 1874 was accepted. However, with recent census research calling White's authentication into question, Calment may very well have been Florence Knapp's actual immediate successor.\\r\\nEttie Mae Greene ne Thomas (September 8, 1877 ÿ February 26, 1992) was an American supercentenarian who was recognized by Guinness World Records as the 'oldest living American' in 1991 (later, the SSA study would replace her with Lucy Hannah, who was apparently older). She was born in Wayside, West Virginia, and worked as a seamstress and a farmer.[83] Greene died of a cold at the Springfield Comprehensive Care Center in Springfield, West Virginia. At the time of her death at the age of 114 years, 171 days, she had nine children (four of whom she had outlived), 21 grandchildren, 47 great-grandchildren and 37 great-great-grandchildren.[83] She still holds the record for being the oldest person in the state of West Virginia.\\r\\nWilhelmina Kott ne Geringer (March 7, 1880 ÿ September 6, 1994)[84] was an American supercentenarian recognized by Guinness World Records as the 'oldest living American' in its 1995 edition,[66] following the death of Margaret Skeete. She was born in Peru, Illinois, as one of 16 children to George and Sophia Geringer. She moved to Chicago in 1881, where she lived almost her entire life. She married Charles Kott in 1899.[66] She died on September 6, 1994, aged 114 years 183 days.\\r\\nMary Electa Bidwell ne Nobel (May 19, 1881ÿ April 25, 1996)[85] was an American supercentenarian. She died at age 114 years, 342 days on April 25, 1996. She is the oldest person ever to die in Connecticut.[86][87][88]\\r\\nHer parents were Charles Woodruff Bidwell and Alice Beach Nobel.[87] She was a descendant of John Bidwell, one of the founders of Hartford, Connecticut. Bidwell worked as a teacher in a one-room school house for six years. She married Charles Hubbell Bidwell, a distant cousin, in 1906.[86]\\r\\nBidwell lived on her own in North Haven, Connecticut, until she was 110. Bidwell died at the Arden House, a nursing home in Hamden, Connecticut.[85][88]\\r\\nMaggie Pauline Barnes ne Hinnant (March 6, 1882 ÿ January 19, 1998)[89] was an American supercentenarian. She was a resident of Johnston County, North Carolina. Barnes died from complications following a minor foot infection.[90] Barnes, who was born to a slave and married a tenant farmer, was survived by four children; 11 of her children preceded her in death.[90]\\r\\nSome dispute exists as to her date of birth. Though the 1882 date is written in the family's bible, the 1900 US Census lists her as having been born in 1881, and her marriage license says she was born in 1880.[90] Authenticating to the latest of those dates, Barnes was 115 years, 319 days old when she died.\\r\\nBarnes is the oldest person ever in U.S. state of North Carolina on record.\\r\\nMae Harrington (ne Maxwell; January 20, 1889 ÿ December 29, 2002) was an American supercentenarian who became the world's oldest living person upon the death of Adelina Domingues. Harrington was also the oldest living American and the oldest person ever from the state of New York, breaking the record held since the 1920s by then world's oldest person Delina Filkins, also 113, but her own record was subsequently broken on May 28, 2005 by Grace Thaxton, who was born in the state before moving to and dying in Kentucky. Because her age was not authenticated during her lifetime, the public recognition she was due went to another 113-year-old, Mary Parr (January 29, 1889 ÿ October 29, 2002), who was born nine days after her, dying two months before her, as her age was only validated posthumously.[91]\\r\\nMary Dorothy Christian (ne Perry, June 12, 1889 ÿ April 20, 2003) was an American supercentenarian who became the oldest recognized person in the United States at age 113 upon the death of 113-year-old Mae Harrington and was succeeded in this title by another 113-year-old, Elena Slough. Perry was born in Taunton, Massachusetts to parents whose name had been anglicized from Perreira (she was of Portuguese descent). She spent much of her life in California, where she died in a San Pablo, California nursing home at 113 years and 312 days.[67][92]\\r\\nElena Proctor Slough ne Rodenbaugh (July 4, 1889 ÿ October 5, 2003)[68] was the oldest recognized person in the United States from the death of Mary Christian on April 20, 2003, until Slough's own death, aged 114 years 93 days, six months later. After her death, the oldest recognized person in the United States was Charlotte Benkner.[68]\\r\\nBorn in Horsham, Pennsylvania, she married twice and had children by each marriage. Her 90-year-old daughter died three days before her, at the same Cape May, New Jersey nursing home. Some sources date her birth to 1888, but the oldest records state that she was born in 1889.[93]\\r\\nCharlotte Benkner (ne Enterlein; November 16, 1889 ÿ May 14, 2004)[94][95][96][97] was an American supercentenarian and the oldest verified living person from Elena Slough's death in 2003 until sufficient documentation was found to validate the age of Ramona Trinidad Iglesias-Jordan of Puerto Rico in March 2004.[94] The subsequent recognition of Mara Capovilla of Ecuador in December 2005 moved Benkner down to third place at the time of her death,[95][96]\\r\\nBenkner was born in Leipzig, Germany, and emigrated to the U.S. in 1896. She grew up in Peekskill, New York, where her family ran the Albert Hotel, and as a young woman once met then President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt.[97][98] On her 1908 marriage to Karl Benkner, she moved west, living in Pennsylvania and Ohio before retiring to Arizona. Already a supercentenarian and the oldest person in Arizona, Benkner returned to Ohio to live in North Lima.[97] She became the oldest recognized person in the United States when 114-year-old Elena Slough died in October 2003.[68] She lived with her sister Tillie O'Hare (the youngest of the siblings), whom she once cared for when their parents were running the hotel, until Tillie (born February 15, 1904) died, just three weeks shy of becoming a centenarian, on January 25, 2004.[98] Benkner survived her sister by only four months, dying at age 114 years 180 days after she was briefly hospitalized in Youngstown, Ohio, and was buried in Peekskill.[94][95]\\r\\nEmma Verona Johnston (ne Calhoun) (August 6, 1890 ÿ December 1, 2004) was an American supercentenarian recognized as the \\"oldest living American\\" from Charlotte Benkner's death in May 2004 until her own death almost 7 months later at age 114 years, 117 days. Johnston was born in Indianola, Iowa to a large family.[99] She was the oldest living graduate of Drake University, where she was a member of the Class of 1912.[100]\\r\\nAt age 98, she moved from Iowa to Ohio in order to live with her daughter and son-in-law. She continued to be in good health even when she attained supercentenarian status, still being able to walk up steps, she was also alert and able to engage in conversations.[2]\\r\\nCharlotte Benkner's death on May 14, 2004 left Johnston as the oldest documented person in the United States. She died in Worthington, Ohio on December 1, 2004.[99]\\r\\nGrace Thaxton (ne Menges) (June 18, 1891 - July 6, 2005) was one of oldest people in the United States until her death on July 6, 2005, age 114 years and 18 days. She became New York state's all-time recordholder on May 28, 2005, aged 113 years 344 days, breaking the record set by Mae Harrington in December 2002.[101]\\r\\nThaxton almost lived to see her son Robert (July 12, 1915 ÿ 2011) turn 90 six days after her death, July 12. Thaxton's mother (1860ÿ1969) lived to 109.[102]\\r\\nBettie Antry Wilson ne Rutherford (September 13, 1890 ÿ February 13, 2006)[103] was thought to be the oldest verified living person in the United States upon the death of 114-year-old Emma Verona Johnston on December 1, 2004 until the subsequent verification of Elizabeth Bolden. Both were born in the rural Southwhere they lived less than 100 miles apart.\\r\\nBorn of freed slaves, Solomon and Delia Rutherford, she is the oldest resident of the state of Mississippi ever recorded (the previous record was 113 years, 12 days set in 1994). In late April 2005, Wilson moved into a new home funded by donations.\\r\\nWilson celebrated her 115th birthday in September 2005, at which time she ranked as the third-oldest living person in the world.\\r\\nWilson died at her New Albany home on February 13, 2006, aged 115 years, 153 days. She was survived by her son, five grandchildren, 46 great-grandchildren, 95 great-great-grandchildren and 38 great-great-great grandchildren.[103]\\r\\nThomas D. Nelson, Sr. (July 8, 1895 ÿ January 9, 2007) was, at age 111, the oldest living man in the United States and the second-oldest man in the world from December 7, 2006 (the death of Moses Hardy), for one month until his own death, aged 111 years, 185 days.\\r\\nHe had been living in Port Arthur, Texas, since the early 1930s. He opened a candy shop in the mid-1930s, and worked there for more than 60 years.[104][105]\\r\\nArbella Ewing (ne Perkins) (March 13, 1894 ÿ March 22, 2008)[54][106] was, at the time of her death at age 114, the third-oldest living person in the world behind Edna Parker of United States and Maria de Jesus of Portugal, the second-oldest person in the United States and the oldest living African American.[107]\\r\\nEwing, the fourth of 12 children, grew up in Streetman, Texas, and married Frank Ewing in 1915, after which she moved to South Dallas. Her former house is still located in South Dallas today. She had a sister named Annie, who was born in 1904 and was 103 at the time of her death. When she was an adult, she worked in a local bikeshop in Streetman. Her great-grandparents were slaves in Mississippi. After marrying Frank Ewing, they had a daughter, named Claudia, who died in 1970. The Ewing family stated she was a gem in the family according to The Dallas Morning News. She lived in her own home in Dallas until the age of 113, after breaking her hip at her birthday party, she was moved into a personal care home, where she eventually died nine days after having reached the age of 114. The people close to her attributed her longevity to positive thinking.[107][108][109]\\r\\nGeorge Rene Francis (June 6, 1896 ÿ December 27, 2008)[110][111][112] was an American supercentenarian and the joint second-oldest living man in the world, together with Englishman Henry Allingham, until Francis's death aged 112 years, 204 days. He was also the oldest living man in the United States, following the death of Antonio Pierro on February 8, 2007. Francis was from New Orleans, Louisiana, but since 1949 lived in Sacramento, California, where a local newspaper published a poem that Francis enjoyed reciting to friends and the public throughout his life.[113] He credited his longevity to nature, and enjoyed a rich diet of pork, eggs, milk and lard. He gave up smoking cigars at the age of 75.[114]\\r\\nFrancis attempted to join the army in World War I but was rejected for service in 1918 as being too short and small (he weighed only about 100 pounds (45.35?kg)). Despite this, he later was a boxer before becoming a barber and then a chauffeur.[110] Francis claimed to have met Louis Armstrong and Booker T. Washington and to have seen Babe Ruth hit a home run. His wife died in 1964.\\r\\nShelby Harris (March 31, 1901?ÿ July 25, 2012),[115] an African American, was the oldest verified man in the United States (since the death of Walter Breuning on April 14, 2011), the third-oldest man in the world and Illinois's oldest living person at the time of his death.[115][116][117]\\r\\nA native of Ayrshire, Indiana, Harris worked in coal mines and a foundry. At 41 he joined the Army for World War II, but a broken ankle ended his training. A deacon of his church until he was 102, Harris entered a Rock Island nursing home at 105. At his death he was a great-great-great-grandfather, his youngest grandson was 57 years old.[118] Harris died on July 25, 2012, aged 111 years, 116 days.[115]\\r\\n120. http://obits.nj.com/obituaries/starledger/obituary.aspx?n=lure-ryan&pid=188146004","input":"Who is the oldest person living in the united states?"},{"output":"three","context":"","input":"How many films are there of the hobbit?"},{"output":"Aylesbury duck","context":"The Aylesbury duck is a breed of domesticated duck, bred mainly for its meat and appearance. It is a large duck with pure white plumage, a pink bill, orange legs and feet, an unusually large keel, and a horizontal stance with its body parallel to the ground. The precise origins of the breed are unclear, but raising white ducks became popular in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, in the 18th century owing to the demand for white feathers as a filler for quilts. Over the 19th century selective breeding for size, shape and colour led to the Aylesbury duck.\\r\\nDuck rearing became a major industry in Aylesbury in the 19th century. The ducks were bred on farms in the surrounding countryside. Fertilised eggs were brought into the town's \\"Duck End\\", where local residents would rear the ducklings in their homes. The opening of a railway to Aylesbury in 1839 enabled cheap and quick transport to the markets of London, and duck rearing became highly profitable. By the 1860s the duck rearing industry began to move out of Aylesbury into the surrounding towns and villages, and the industry in Aylesbury itself began to decline.\\r\\nIn 1873 the Pekin duck was introduced to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier and cheaper to raise. Many breeders switched to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.\\r\\nThe First World War badly damaged the remaining duck industry in Buckinghamshire, wiping out the small scale producers and leaving only a few large farms. Disruption caused by the Second World War further damaged the industry. By the 1950s only one significant flock of Aylesbury ducks remained in Buckinghamshire, and by 1966 there were no duck-breeding or -rearing businesses of any size remaining in Aylesbury itself. Although there is only one surviving flock of pure Aylesbury ducks in the United Kingdom and the breed is critically endangered in the United States, the Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury, and appears on the coat of arms of Aylesbury and on the club badge of Aylesbury United.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe precise origin of the Aylesbury duck is unclear.[1] Before the 18th?century, duck breeds were rarely recorded in England, and the common duck, bred for farming, was a domesticated form of the wild mallard. The common duck varied in colour, and as in the wild, white ducks would occasionally occur.[1] White ducks were particularly prized, as their feathers were popular as a filler for quilts.[2]\\r\\nIn the 18th century selective breeding of white common ducks led to a white domestic duck, generally known as the English White.[1] Since at least the 1690s ducks had been farmed in Aylesbury,[3] and raising English Whites became popular in Aylesbury and the surrounding villages.[4] By 1813 it was remarked that \\"ducks form a material article at market from Aylesbury and places adjacent: they are white, and as it seems of an early breed: they are bred and brought up by poor people, and sent to London by the weekly carriers\\".[5] The duck farmers of Aylesbury went to great lengths to ensure the ducks retained their white colouring, keeping them clear of dirty water, soil with a high iron content and bright sunlight, all of which could discolour the ducks' feathers.[6] Over time, selective breeding of the English White for size and colour gradually led to the development of the Aylesbury duck.[6]\\r\\nA rather large duck breed,[7] the Aylesbury duck has pure white plumage and bright orange legs and feet.[1] Its legs are placed midway along the body and it stands with its underside parallel to the ground, giving it a body described as \\"boat-shaped\\".[1][8] It has a relatively long and thin swan-like neck, and a long pink bill which comes straight out from the head.[1][note 1]\\r\\nAn Aylesbury duckling incubates in the egg for 28 days.[9] Until eight weeks after hatching, the time of their first moult, ducks and drakes (females and males) are almost indistinguishable. After moulting, males have two or three curved tail feathers and a fainter, huskier quack than the female. By one year of age, females and males grow to an average weight of 6 and 7 pounds (2.7 and 3.2?kg) respectively, although males can reach around 10 pounds (4.5?kg).[1][7]\\r\\nUnlike the Rouen duck, the other popular meat variety in England in the 19th century, Aylesbury ducks lay eggs from early November.[6] Aylesbury ducks fatten quickly and by eight weeks after hatching weigh up to 5 pounds (2.3?kg), large enough to eat but still young and extremely tender.[10] Consequently, their meat came onto the market from February onwards, after the close of the game season but before the earliest spring chickens were on sale.[6] Rouen ducks, whose mallard-like coloration made them less valuable, lay eggs from early February and take six months to grow large enough to eat.[6] As a consequence, Aylesbury ducks were sold primarily in the spring and summer, and Rouen ducks in the autumn and winter.[6][note 2]\\r\\nThe white Aylesbury duck is, and deservedly, a universal favourite. Its snowy plumage and comfortable comportment make it a credit to the poultry-yard, while its broad and deep breast, and its ample back, convey the assurance that your satisfaction will not cease at its death. In parts of Buckinghamshire, this member of the duck family is bred on an extensive scale; not on plains and commons, however, as might be naturally imagined, but in the abodes of the cottagers. Round the walls of the living-rooms, and of the bedroom even, are fixed rows of wooden boxes, lined with hay; and it is the business of the wife and children to nurse and comfort the feathered lodgers, to feed the little ducklings, and to take the old ones out for an airing. Sometimes the \\"stock\\" ducks are the cottager's own property, but it more frequently happens that they are intrusted to his care by a wholesale breeder, who pays him so much per score for all ducklings properly raised. To be perfect, the Aylesbury duck should be plump, pure white, with yellow feet, and a flesh coloured beak.[11]\\r\\nUnlike most livestock farming in England at this time, the duck breeders and duck rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups.[12] Stock ducksi.e., ducks kept for breedingwere kept on farms in the countryside of the Aylesbury Vale, away from the polluted air and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, and meant a higher number of fertile eggs.[10]\\r\\nStock ducks would be chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females at any given time.[13] The females would be kept for around a year before mating, typically to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding.[14] Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders;[13] breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head.[14] The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal fat).[14] As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight.[14]\\r\\nFemale Aylesbury ducks would not sit still for the 28 days necessary for their eggs to hatch, and as a consequence the breeders would not allow mothers to sit on their own eggs. Instead the fertilised eggs would be collected and transferred to the \\"duckers\\" of Aylesbury's Duck End.[15][note 3]\\r\\nThe duckers of Aylesbury would buy eggs from the breeders,[10] or be paid by a breeder to raise the ducks on their behalf,[11] and would raise the ducklings in their homes between November and August as a secondary source of income. Duckers were typically skilled labourers, who invested surplus income in ducklings. Many of the tasks related to rearing the ducks would be carried out by the women of the household,[10] particularly the care of newly hatched ducklings.[9]\\r\\nThe eggs would be divided into batches of 13, and placed under broody chickens.[9][note 4] In the last week of the four-week incubation period the eggs would be sprinkled daily with warm water to soften the shells and allow the ducklings to hatch.[9]\\r\\nNewly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid and thrive best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into groups of three or four ducklings, each accompanied by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be kept in groups of around 30.[9] Originally the ducks would be kept in every room in the ducker's cottage, but towards the end of the 19th?century they were kept in outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.[9]\\r\\nThe aim of the ducker was to get every duckling as fat as possible by the age of eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy.[17] In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.)[17] This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins.[17][note 5] As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote;[17] this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour.[7] Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.[9]\\r\\nWhile ducks are naturally aquatic, swimming can be dangerous to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.[18]\\r\\nAlthough there were a few large-scale duck rearing operations in Aylesbury, raising thousands of ducklings each season, the majority of Aylesbury's duckers would raise between 400 and 1,000 ducklings each year.[10] Because ducking was a secondary occupation, it was not listed in Aylesbury's census returns or directories and it is impossible to know how many people were engaged in it at any given time.[10] Kelly's Directory for 1864 does not list a single duck farmer in Aylesbury,[10] but an 1885 book comments that:\\r\\nIn the early years of the present [19th] century almost every householder at the \\"Duck End\\" of the town followed the avocation of ducker. In a living room it was no uncommon sight to meet with young ducks of different ages, divided in pens and monopolizing the greatest space of the apartment, whilst expected new arrivals often were carefully lodged in the bedchamber.[19]\\r\\nThe Duck End was one of the poorer districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19th?century it had no sewers or refuse collections.[16] The area had a number of open ditches filled with stagnant water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common.[4] The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting,[16] and no running water.[14] Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors.[16]\\r\\nWhen the ducklings were ready for slaughter, the duckers would generally kill them on their own premises. The slaughter would generally take place in the morning, to ensure the ducks would be ready for market in the evening. To keep the meat as white as possible, the ducks would be suspended upside down and their necks broken backwards, and held in this position until their blood had run towards their heads. They were kept in this position for ten minutes before being plucked, as otherwise their blood would collect in those parts of the body from which the feathers had been plucked.[18] The plucking was generally carried out by the women of the household.[18] The plucked carcasses would be sent to market, and the feathers would be sold direct to London dealers.[20]\\r\\nThe market for duck meat in Aylesbury itself was small, and the ducks were generally sent to London for sale. By the 1750s Richard Pococke recorded that four cartloads of ducks were sent from Aylesbury to London every Saturday,[21] and in the late 18th and early 19th centuries the ducks continued to be sent over the Chiltern Hills to London by packhorse or cart.[20]\\r\\nOn 15?June?1839 the entrepreneur and former Member of Parliament for Buckingham, Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet, opened the Aylesbury Railway.[22] Built under the direction of Robert Stephenson,[23] it connected the London and Birmingham Railway's Cheddington railway station on the West Coast Main Line to Aylesbury High Street railway station in eastern Aylesbury.[24] On 1?October?1863 the Wycombe Railway also built a line to Aylesbury, from Princes Risborough railway station to a station on the western side of Aylesbury (the present-day Aylesbury railway station).[24] The arrival of the railway had a powerful impact on the duck industry, and up to a ton of ducks in a night were being shipped from Aylesbury to Smithfield Market in London by 1850.[20]\\r\\nA routine became established in which salesmen would provide the duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, take them to the stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable.[20] By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over S20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around S80ÿS200 per year.[25][note 6]\\r\\nIn 1845, the first National Poultry Show was held, at the Zoological Gardens in London; one of the classes of poultry exhibited was \\"Aylesbury or other white variety\\". The personal interest of Queen Victoria in poultry farming, and its inclusion in the Great Exhibition of 1851, further raised public interest in poultry. From 1853 the Royal Agricultural Society and the Bath and West of England Society, the two most prominent agricultural societies in England, included poultry sections in their annual agricultural shows. This in turn caused smaller local poultry shows to develop across the country.[28]\\r\\nBreeders would choose potential exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, and they would be given a great deal of extra attention. They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a physical condition as possible. Before the show, their legs and feet would be washed, their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with linseed oil.[28] While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal before the show to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the ducks with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible.[29] Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks, with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin.[29] By the beginning of the 20th?century the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat.[29]\\r\\nIn 1873 the Pekin duck was introduced from China to Britain for the first time. Superficially similar in appearance to an Aylesbury duck, a Pekin is white with orange legs and bill, with its legs near the rear, giving it an upright stance while on land.[8] Although not thought to have such a delicate flavour as the Aylesbury,[30] the Pekin was hardier, a more prolific layer,[8] fattened more quickly,[31] and was roughly the same size as an Aylesbury at nine weeks.[8]\\r\\nAylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were becoming inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were more susceptible to disease.[30][32] Exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers.[8] Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury.[8] Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks did not have the delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.[8]\\r\\nUntil the mid-19th?century duck rearing was concentrated on the Duck End, but by the 1860s it had spread to many other towns and villages in the area, particularly Weston Turville and Haddenham.[33] Contamination of Aylesbury's soil by years of duck rearing, and new public health legislation which ended many traditional practices, caused the decline of the duck rearing industry in the Duck End, and by the 1890s the majority of Aylesbury ducks were raised in the villages rather than the town itself.[33] Population shifts and the improved national rail network reduced the need to rear ducks near London, and large duck farms opened in Lancashire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire.[33] Although the number of ducks raised nationwide continued to grow, between 1890 and 1900 the number of ducks raised in the Aylesbury area remained static, and from 1900 it began to drop.[33]\\r\\nBy the time Beatrix Potter's 1908 The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duckabout an Aylesbury duck although set in Cumbriacaused renewed interest in the breed, the Aylesbury duck was in steep decline.[7] The duckers of Buckinghamshire had generally failed to introduce technological improvements such as the incubator, and inbreeding had dangerously weakened the breed.[30][32] Meanwhile, the cost of duck food had risen fourfold over the 19th?century, and from 1873 onwards competition from Pekin and Pekin cross ducks was undercutting Aylesbury ducks at the marketplace.[8]\\r\\nThe First World War devastated the remaining duckers of Buckinghamshire. The price of duck food rose steeply while the demand for luxury foodstuffs fell,[30] and wartime restructuring ended the beneficial financial arrangements with the railway companies.[34] By the end of the war small-scale duck rearing in the Aylesbury Vale had vanished, with duck raising dominated by a few large duck farms.[35] Shortages of duck food in the Second World War caused further disruption to the industry, and almost all duck farming in the Aylesbury Vale ended.[35] A 1950 \\"Aylesbury Duckling Day\\" campaign to boost the reputation of the Aylesbury duck had little effect;[36] by the end of the 1950s the last significant farms had closed, other than a single flock in Chesham owned by Mr?L.?T.?Waller,[35] and by 1966 there were no duck breeders or rearers of any size remaining in Aylesbury.[37] As of 2015[update] the Waller family's farm in Chesham remains in business, the last surviving flock of pure Aylesbury meat ducks in the country.[35][38][39]\\r\\nAylesbury ducks were imported into the United States in 1840, although they never became a popular breed. They were, however, added to the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection breeding guidelines in 1876.[40] As of 2013, the breed was listed as critically endangered in the United States by The Livestock Conservancy.[41]\\r\\nThe Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury. Aylesbury United F.C. are nicknamed \\"The Ducks\\" and include an Aylesbury duck on their club badge,[42] and the town's coat of arms includes an Aylesbury duck and plaited straw, representing the two historic industries of the town.[43] The Aylesbury Brewery Company, now defunct, featured the Aylesbury duck as its logo, an example of which can still be seen at the Britannia pub.[44] Duck Farm Court is a shopping area of modern Aylesbury located near the historic hamlet of California, close to one of the main breeding grounds for ducks in the town,[45] and there have been two pubs in the town with the name \\"The Duck\\" in recent years; one in Bedgrove that has since been demolished[46] and one in Jackson Road that has recently been renamed.[47]","input":"What kind of duck is jemima puddle duck?"},{"output":"Union","context":"The Battle of Philippi formed part of the Western Virginia Campaign of the American Civil War, and was fought in and around Philippi, Virginia (now West Virginia) on June 3, 1861. A Union victory, it was the first organized land action of the war, though generally viewed as a skirmish rather than a battle. However, the Northern press celebrated it as an epic triumph, and this encouraged Congress to call for the drive on Richmond that ended with the Union defeat at First Bull Run in July. It brought overnight fame to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, and was notable for the first battlefield amputations. It also encouraged the western counties of Virginia to form their own Union state.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the largely-untrained Confederates had fled the battlefield with barely any resistance, the Union jokingly referred to the engagement as the Philippi Races.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement of hostilities at Fort Sumter in April 1861, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan returned to the Army and on May 13 assumed command of the Department of the Ohio, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio.[3] McClellan planned an offensive into what is now the State of West Virginia (at the time the northwestern counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia) which he hoped would lead to a campaign against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. His immediate objectives were to occupy the territory to protect the largely pro-Union populace in the counties along the Ohio River, and to keep open the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad line, a critical supply line for the Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 26, McClellan, in response to the burning of bridges on the Baltimore & Ohio near the town of Farmington, ordered Col. Benjamin Franklin Kelley of the (Union) 1st West Virginia Infantry[4] with his regiment and Company A of the 2nd West Virginia Infantry, to advance from Wheeling to the area and safeguard the important bridge over the Monongahela River at Fairmont, a distance of about 70 miles (110?km) southeast of Wheeling. Kelley's men were supported by the 16th Ohio Infantry under Col. James Irvine. After securing Fairmont, the 1st West Virginia advanced again and seized the important railroad junction of Grafton, about 15 miles (24?km) southeast of Fairmont, on May 30.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the 14th Ohio Infantry Regiment, under Col. James B. Steedman, was ordered to occupy Parkersburg and then proceed to Grafton, about 90 miles (140?km) to the east. By May 28, McClellan had ordered a total of about 3,000 troops into Western Virginia and placed them under the overall command of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Morris, commander of Indiana Volunteers. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 4 Confederate Col. George A. Porterfield had been assigned command of the state forces in northwestern Virginia and ordered to Grafton to take charge of enlistments in the area. As the Union columns advanced, Porterfield's poorly armed 800 recruits retreated to Philippi, about 17 miles (27?km) south of Grafton. Philippi was the county seat of Barbour County, which had voted in favor of Virginia's secession ordinance. A palmetto secession flag had been flying above the courthouse since January, 1861.[5] At Philippi, a covered bridge spanned the Tygart Valley River and was an important segment of the vital Beverly-Fairmont Turnpike.\\r\\n\\r\\nCol. Kelley devised a two-prong attack against the Confederate force in Philippi, approved by Gen. Morris on his arrival in Grafton on June 1. The principal advance would be 1,600 men led by Kelley himself, and would include six companies of his own regiment, nine of the 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment under Col. Robert H. Milroy, and six of the 16th Ohio Infantry. In order to deceive the enemy into thinking the objective was Harpers Ferry, they departed by train to the east. They disembarked at the small village of Thornton and marched south on a back road on the same side of the river as Philippi, intending to arrive at the rear of the town.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the 7th Indiana under Col. Ebenezer Dumont were sent to Webster, about 3.5 miles (5.6?km) southwest of Grafton. They would unite with the 6th Indiana under Col. Thomas T. Crittenden and the 14th Ohio under Col. Steedman. The column, with a total of 1,400 men under Col. Dumont (with the assistance of Col. Frederick W. Lander, volunteer aide-de-camp to Gen. McClellan), would march directly south from Webster on the Turnpike. In this way, the Union force would execute a double envelopment of the outnumbered Confederates.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 2, the Union columns set off to converge on Philippi. After an overnight march in rainy weather, both arrived at Philippi before dawn the following morning. Morris had planned a predawn assault to be signaled by a pistol shot. The green Confederate volunteers had failed to establish picket lines for perimeter security, choosing instead to escape the cold rain and stay inside their tents. A Confederate sympathizer, Mrs. Thomas Humphreys, saw the approaching Union troops and sent her young son on horseback to warn the Confederates. As Mrs. Humphreys watched, she saw Union pickets capture her son and fired her pistol at them. She missed, but her shots began the attack prematurely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union attackers began firing their artillery, which awakened the Confederates from their slumber. Those who were armed fired a few shots at the advancing bluecoats, then Southerners broke and began running to the south, some still in their bed clothes. This caused Union journalists to refer to the battle as the \\"Races at Philippi\\". Dumont's soldiers entered the town from the bridge (Col. Lander's ride down the steep hillside through heavy underbrush was considered such a feat of horsemanship that Leslie's Weekly gave an illustrated account of it shortly afterward[6]), but Kelley's column had arrived from the north on the wrong road and were unable to block the Confederate retreat. Kelley himself was shot while pursuing some of the retreating Confederates, but Col. Lander chased down and captured the man who shot Kelley. The Confederates retreated to Huttonsville, about 45 miles (72?km) to the south.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilippi was the first organized land action in the war[7] (the impromptu Battle of Fairfax Court House, two days earlier, could not be counted as such), and Union victory in this relatively bloodless battle propelled McClellan into the national spotlight. The Northern press, hungry for battle stories, presented it as an epic triumph, encouraging politicians to demand the big advance on Richmond, which became Bull Run. It also inspired more vocal protests in the Western part of Virginia against secession. A few days later, pro-Unionists at the Wheeling Convention nullified the Virginia ordinance of secession and named Francis H. Pierpont governor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two significant Confederate casualties. Both were treated with battlefield amputations, believed to be the first such operations of the war. One was a Virginia Military Institute cadet, Fauntleroy Daingerfield. The other Confederate was James E. Hanger, an 18-year-old college student. After recovering and being released, Hanger returned home to Virginia. He made an artificial leg from barrel staves with a hinge at the knee. His design worked so well that the Virginia State Legislature commissioned him to manufacture the Hanger Limb for other wounded soldiers. After the war, Hanger patented his prosthetic device and founded what is now the Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc.[8] As of 2007, Hanger Orthopedic Group is the United States market leader in the manufacture of artificial limbs.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the battle, Col. Porterfield was replaced in command of Confederate forces in western Virginia by Brig. Gen. Robert S. Garnett. The companies of Confederate recruits who had been at Philippi became part of various regiments, including the 9th Virginia Infantry Battalion, 25th Virginia Infantry, 31st Virginia Infantry, 11th Virginia Cavalry, and the 14th Virginia Cavalry. The Barbour Lighthorse Cavalry, commanded by Capt. William Jenkins, disbanded after the retreat from Philippi.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe short-story writer and satirist Ambrose Bierce (1842ÿca. 1914) was a Union recruit at the Battle of Philippi. Twenty years later, he wrote, in an autobiographical fragment he called On a Mountain:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe gave ourselves, this aristocracy of service, no end of military airs; some of us even going to the extreme of keeping our jackets buttoned and our hair combed.

The city anchors the Las Vegas Valley metropolitan area and is the largest city within the greater Mojave Desert.[6] Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major resort city, known primarily for its gambling, shopping, fine dining, entertainment, and nightlife. The Las Vegas Valley as a whole serves as the leading financial, commercial, and cultural center for Nevada.\\r\\nThe city bills itself as The Entertainment Capital of the World, and is famous for its mega casinoÿhotels and associated activities. It is a top three destination in the United States for business conventions and a global leader in the hospitality industry, claiming more AAA Five Diamond hotels than any other city in the world.[7][8][9] Today, Las Vegas annually ranks as one of the world's most visited tourist destinations.[10][11] The city's tolerance for numerous forms of adult entertainment earned it the title of Sin City, and has made Las Vegas a popular setting for literature, films, television programs, and music videos.\\r\\nLas Vegas was settled in 1905 and officially incorporated in 1911. At the close of the 20th century, it was the most populated American city founded within that century (a similar distinction earned by Chicago in the 1800s). Population growth has accelerated since the 1960s, and between 1990 and 2000 the population nearly doubled, increasing by 85.2%. Rapid growth has continued into the 21st century, and according to a 2017 estimate, the population is 648,224[12] with a regional population of 2,248,390.[4]\\r\\n\\"Las Vegas\\" is often used to describe areas beyond official city limitsespecially the areas on and near the Las Vegas Strip, which is actually located within the unincorporated communities of Paradise, Winchester, and Enterprise.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the earliest visitors to the Las Vegas area were nomadic Paleo-Indians, who traveled there 10,000 years ago, leaving behind petroglyphs. Anasazi and Paiute tribes followed at least 2,000 years ago.\\r\\nA young Mexican scout named Rafael Rivera is credited as the first non-Native American to encounter the valley, in 1829.[16][17][18][19] Trader Antonio Armijo led a 60-man party along the Spanish Trail to Los Angeles, California in 1829.[20][21] The area was named Las Vegas, which is Spanish for \\"the meadows,\\" as it featured abundant wild grasses, as well as the desert spring waters needed by westward travelers.[22] The year 1844 marked the arrival of John C. Frmont, whose writings helped lure pioneers to the area. Downtown Las Vegas's Fremont Street is named after him.\\r\\nEleven years later members of the LDS Church chose Las Vegas as the site to build a fort halfway between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, where they would travel to gather supplies. The fort was abandoned several years afterward. The remainder of this Old Mormon Fort can still be seen at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue.\\r\\nLas Vegas was founded as a city in 1905, when 110 acres (45?ha) of land adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad tracks were auctioned in what would become the downtown area. In 1911, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city.[23]\\r\\n1931 was a pivotal year for Las Vegas. At that time, Nevada legalized casino gambling and reduced residency requirements for divorce to six weeks. This year also witnessed the beginning of construction on nearby Hoover Dam. The influx of construction workers and their families helped Las Vegas avoid economic calamity during the Great Depression. The construction work was completed in 1935.\\r\\nIn 1941, the Las Vegas Army Air Corps Gunnery School was established. Currently known as Nellis Air Force Base, it is home to the aerobatic team called the Thunderbirds.\\r\\nFollowing World War II, lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos, and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas.\\r\\nIn the 1950s the Moulin Rouge opened and became the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas.\\r\\nIn 1951, nuclear weapons testing began at the Nevada Test Site, 65 miles (105?km) northwest of Las Vegas. City residents and visitors were able to witness the mushroom clouds (and were exposed to the fallout) until 1963, when the limited Test Ban Treaty required that nuclear tests be moved underground.[24][25]\\r\\nThe iconic \\"Welcome to Las Vegas\\" sign, which was never located within municipal limits, was created in 1959 by Betty Willis.[26]\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, corporations and business powerhouses such as Howard Hughes were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as \\"gaming\\" which transitioned into legitimate business.\\r\\nThe year 1995 marked the opening of the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas's downtown area. This canopied five-block area features 12.5 million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight during shows held on the top of each hour.\\r\\nDue to the realization of many revitalization efforts, 2012 was dubbed \\"The Year of Downtown.\\" Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of projects made their debut at this time. They included The Smith Center for the Performing Arts and DISCOVERY Children's Museum, Mob Museum, Neon Museum, a new City Hall complex and renovations for a new Zappos.com corporate headquarters in the old City Hall building.[22][27]\\r\\nLas Vegas is situated within Clark County in a basin on the floor of the Mojave Desert[28] and is surrounded by mountain ranges on all sides. Much of the landscape is rocky and arid with desert vegetation and wildlife. It can be subjected to torrential flash floods, although much has been done to mitigate the effects of flash floods through improved drainage systems.[29]\\r\\nThe peaks surrounding Las Vegas reach elevations of over 10,000 feet (3,000?m), and act as barriers to the strong flow of moisture from the surrounding area. The elevation is approximately 2,030?ft (620?m) above sea level. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 135.86?sq?mi (351.9?km2), of which 135.81?sq?mi (351.7?km2) is land and 0.05?sq?mi (0.13?km2) (0.03%) is water.\\r\\nNevada is the third most seismically active state in the U.S. (after Alaska and California); it has been estimated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that over the next 50 years there is a 10ÿ20% chance of a M6.0 or greater earthquake occurring within 50?km of Las Vegas.[30]\\r\\nWithin the city there are many lawns, trees and other greenery. Due to water resource issues, there has been a movement to encourage xeriscapes. Another part of conservation efforts is scheduled watering days for residential landscaping. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant in 2008 funded a program that analyzed and forecast growth and environmental impacts through the year 2019.\\r\\nLas Vegas has a subtropical hot desert climate (K?ppen climate classification: BWh), typical of the Mojave Desert in which it lies. This climate is typified by long, very hot summers; warm transitional seasons; and short, mild to chilly winters. There is abundant sunshine throughout the year, with an average of 310 sunny days and bright sunshine during 86% of all daylight hours.[31] Rainfall is scarce, with an average of 4.2?in (110?mm) dispersed between roughly 26 to 27 total rainy days per year.[32] Las Vegas is among the sunniest, driest, and least humid locations in North America,[33] with exceptionally low dew points and humidity that sometimes remains below 10%.\\r\\nThe summer months of June through September are very hot, though moderated by extremely low humidity. July is the hottest month, with an average daytime high of 104.2?F (40.1?C). On average, 134 days per year reach or exceed 90?F (32?C), of which 74 days reach 100?F (38?C) and 7 days reach 110?F (43?C). During the peak intensity of summer, overnight lows frequently remain above 80?F (27?C) and occasionally above 85?F (29?C).[31] While most summer days are consistently hot, dry, and cloudless, the North American Monsoon sporadically interrupts this pattern and brings more cloud cover, thunderstorms, lightning, increased humidity, and brief spells of heavy rain. The window of opportunity for the monsoon to affect Las Vegas usually falls between July and August, although this is inconsistent and varies considerably in its impact from year to year. Summer in Las Vegas is marked by a significant diurnal variation; while less extreme than other parts of the state, nighttime lows in Las Vegas are often 30?F (16.7?C) or more lower than daytime highs.[34]\\r\\nLas Vegas winters are short and generally very mild, with chilly (but rarely cold) daytime temperatures. Like all seasons, sunshine is abundant. December is both the year's coolest and cloudiest month, with an average daytime high of 56.6?F (13.7?C) and sunshine occurring during 78% of its daylight hours. Winter evenings are defined by clear skies and swift drops in temperature after sunset, with overnight lows sinking to 39?F (3.9?C) or lower during the majority of nights in December and January. Owing to its elevation that ranges from 2,000 feet to 3,000 feet, Las Vegas experiences markedly cooler winters than other areas of the Mojave Desert and the adjacent Sonoran Desert that are closer to sea level. Consequently, the city records freezing temperatures an average of 16 nights per winter. However, it is exceptionally rare for temperatures to fall to or below 25?F (?4?C), or for temperatures to remain below 45?F (7?C) for an entire day.[31] Most of the annual precipitation falls during the winter months, but even the wettest month (February) averages only four days of measurable rain. The mountains immediately surrounding the Las Vegas Valley accumulate snow every winter, but significant or sustained accumulation within the city is rare. The most recent accumulating snowfall occurred on December 17, 2008, when Las Vegas received 3.6 inches (9.1?cm).[35] Las Vegas' largest snowfall on record was 12 inches (30?cm) that fell in 1909.[36]\\r\\nAccording to the 2010 Census, the racial composition of Las Vegas was as follows:[45]\\r\\nSource:[46]\\r\\nThe city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic Whites,[41] have proportionally declined from 72.1% of the population in 1990 to 47.9% in 2010, even as total numbers of all ethnicities have increased with the population. Hispanics or Latinos of any race make up 31.5% of the population. Of those 24.0% are of Mexican, 1.4% of Salvadoran, 0.9% of Puerto Rican, 0.9% of Cuban, 0.6% of Guatemalan, 0.2% of Peruvian, 0.2% of Colombian, 0.2% of Honduran and 0.2% of Nicaraguan descent. [43]\\r\\nHawaiians and Las Vegans sometimes refer to Las Vegas as the \\"ninth island of Hawaii\\" because so many Hawaiians have moved to the city.[47]\\r\\nAs of the census[48] of 2010, there were 583,756 people, 211,689 households, and 117,538 families residing in the city. The population density was 4,222.5/sq?mi (1,630.3/km2). There are 190,724 housing units at an average density of 1,683.3/sq?mi (649.9/km2).\\r\\nAs of 2006, there were 176,750 households, out of which 31.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.3% were married couples living together, 12.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.5% were non-families. 25.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.20.\\r\\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 25.9% under the age of 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 32.0% from 25 to 44, 21.7% from 45 to 64, and 11.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 103.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.5 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $53,000 and the median income for a family was $58,465.[49] Males had a median income of $35,511 versus $27,554 for females. The per capita income for the city was $22,060. About 6.6% of families and 8.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.4% of those under age 18 and 6.3% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nAccording to a 2004 study, Las Vegas has one of the highest divorce rates.[50][51] The city's high divorce rate is not wholly due to Las Vegans themselves getting divorced. Since divorce is easier in Nevada than most other states, many people come from across the country for the easier process. Similarly, Nevada marriages are notoriously easy to get. Las Vegas has one of the highest marriage rates of U.S. cities, with many licenses issued to people from outside the area (see Las Vegas weddings).\\r\\nThe primary drivers of the Las Vegas economy are tourism, gaming and conventions, which in turn feed the retail and restaurant industries.\\r\\nThe major attractions in Las Vegas are the casinos and the hotels, although in recent years other new attractions have begun to emerge.\\r\\nMost casinos in the downtown area are located on Fremont Street, with The Stratosphere being one of the exceptions. Fremont East, adjacent to the Fremont Street Experience, was granted variances to allow bars to be closer together, similar to the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego, the goal being to attract a different demographic than the Strip attracts.\\r\\nThe Golden Gate Hotel & Casino, located downtown along the Fremont Street Experience, is the oldest continuously operating hotel and casino in Las Vegas; it opened in 1906 as the Hotel Nevada.\\r\\nThe year 1931 marked the opening of the Northern Club (now the La Bayou).[52][53] The most notable of the early casinos may have been Binion's Horseshoe (now Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel) while it was run by Benny Binion.\\r\\nBoyd Gaming has a major presence downtown operating the California Hotel & Casino, Fremont Hotel & Casino and the Main Street Casino. Other casinos operations include the Four Queens Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas Club (currently undergoing renovation) and Mermaid's Casino, which are also located downtown along the Fremont Street Experience.\\r\\nDowntown casinos that have undergone major renovations and revitalization in recent years include the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino, The D Las Vegas Hotel Casino (formerly Fitzgerald's), Downtown Grand (formerly Lady Luck), El Cortez Hotel & Casino and The Plaza Hotel & Casino.[54]\\r\\nThe center of the gambling and entertainment industry, however, is located on the Las Vegas Strip, outside the city limits in the surrounding unincorporated communities of Paradise and Winchester in Clark County. The largest and most notable casinos and buildings are located there.\\r\\nWhen The Mirage opened in 1989, it started a trend of major resort development on the Las Vegas Strip outside of the city. This resulted in a drop in tourism in the downtown area, but many recent projects have increased the number of visitors to downtown.\\r\\nAn effort has been made by city officials to diversify the economy by attracting health-related, high-tech and other commercial interests. No state tax for individuals or corporations, as well as a lack of other forms of business-related taxes,[55] have aided the success of these efforts.\\r\\nThe Fremont Street Experience was built in an effort to draw tourists back to the area, and has been popular since its startup in 1995.\\r\\nThe city purchased 61 acres (25?ha) of property from the Union Pacific Railroad in 1995 with the goal of creating a better draw for more people to the downtown area. In 2004, Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman announced plans for Symphony Park, which could include a mixture of offerings, such as residential space and office buildings.\\r\\nAlready operating in Symphony Park is the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health (opened in 2010), The Smith Center for the Performing Arts (opened in 2012) and the DISCOVERY Children's Museum (opened in 2013).[56]\\r\\nOn land across from Symphony Park, the World Market Center Las Vegas opened in 2005. It currently encompasses three large buildings with a total of 5.1 million square feet. Trade shows for the furniture and furnishing industries are held there semiannually.\\r\\nAlso located nearby is the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets. A second expansion was completed in May 2015, with the mall currently offering 175 stores.[57]\\r\\nA new Las Vegas City Hall opened in February 2013 on downtown's Main Street. The former City Hall building is now occupied by the corporate headquarters for the major online retailer, Zappos.com, which opened downtown in 2013. Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh has taken an interest in the urban area and has contributed $350 million toward a revitalization effort called the Downtown Project.[58][59] Projects funded include Las Vegas's first independent bookstore, The Writer's Block.[60]\\r\\nA number of new industries have moved to Las Vegas in recent decades. Online shoe retailer Zappos.com (now an Amazon subsidiary) was founded in San Francisco but by 2013 had moved its headquarters to downtown Las Vegas. Allegiant Air, a low-cost carrier launched in 1997, had its first hub at McCarran International Airport and is headquartered in nearby Summerlin.\\r\\nThe city is home to several museums, including the Neon Museum (the location for many of the historical signs from Las Vegas's mid-20th century heyday), The Mob Museum, the Las Vegas Natural History Museum, the DISCOVERY Children's Museum, the Nevada State Museum and the Old Las Vegas Mormon State Historic Park.\\r\\nThe city is home to an extensive Downtown Arts District, which hosts numerous galleries and events including the annual Las Vegas Film Festival. \\"First Friday\\" is a monthly celebration that includes arts, music, special presentations and food in a section of the city's downtown region called 18b, The Las Vegas Arts District.[61] The festival extends into the Fremont East Entertainment District as well.[62]\\r\\nThe Thursday prior to First Friday is known in the arts district as \\"Preview Thursday.\\" This evening event highlights new gallery exhibitions throughout the district.[63]\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Academy of International Studies, Performing and Visual Arts is a Grammy award-winning magnet school located in downtown Las Vegas.\\r\\nThe Smith Center for the Performing Arts is situated downtown in Symphony Park. The world-class performing arts center hosts Broadway shows and other major touring attractions, as well as orchestral, opera, ballet, choir, jazz, and dance performances.\\r\\nLas Vegas had earned the moniker Gambling Capital of the World, as the city currently has the largest strip of land-based casinos in the world.[64]\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Valley is the home of one major league professional team, the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League, an expansion team that began play in the 2017ÿ18 NHL season out of T-Mobile Arena in nearby Paradise.[65] In 2020, the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League will relocate to Las Vegas Stadium, which is currently under construction.[66]\\r\\nThe only minor league sports team that plays in the city of Las Vegas is the Las Vegas 51s of the Pacific Coast League, the AAA farm club of the New York Mets, although they will be moving to nearby Summerlin in the 2019 season under a new name.[67]\\r\\nIn response to the original rumors of the eventual NHL expansion team in Las Vegas, ESPN writer Scott Burnside noted several obstacles that would be faced by the city if it were to become a professional sports market, including the presence of legal sports betting, scheduling conflicts with the large number of residents who work nighttime and overnight shifts, and that the casinos would be unlikely to give away tickets to such events as a promotion, as they run contrary to a goal of encouraging patrons to remain in their facilities.[68]\\r\\nLas Vegas has 68 parks. The city owns the land for, but does not operate, four golf courses: Angel Park Golf Club, Desert Pines Golf Club, Durango Hills Golf Club, and the Las Vegas Municipal Golf Course. It is also responsible for 123 playgrounds, 23 softball fields, 10 football fields, 44 soccer fields, 10 dog parks, six community centers, four senior centers, 109 skates parks, six swimming pools, and more.[69]\\r\\nThe city of Las Vegas government operates as a councilÿmanager government. The Mayor sits as a Council member-at-large and presides over all of the City Council meetings. In the event that the Mayor cannot preside over a City Council meeting, the Mayor Pro-Tem is the presiding officer of the meeting until such time as the Mayor returns to his/her seat. The City Manager is responsible for the administration and the day-to-day operations of all municipal services and city departments. The City Manager maintains intergovernmental relationships with federal, state, county and other local governments.\\r\\nMuch of the Las Vegas metropolitan area is split into neighboring incorporated cities or unincorporated communities. Approximately 700,000 people live in unincorporated areas governed by Clark County, and another 465,000 live in incorporated cities such as North Las Vegas, Henderson and Boulder City. Las Vegas and Clark County share a police department, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, which was formed after a 1973 merger of the Las Vegas Police Department and the Clark County Sheriff's Department. North Las Vegas, Henderson, Boulder City and some colleges have their own police departments.\\r\\nA Paiute Indian reservation occupies about 1 acre (0.40?ha) in the downtown area.\\r\\nLas Vegas, home to the Lloyd D. George Federal District Courthouse and the Regional Justice Center, draws numerous companies providing bail, marriage, divorce, tax, incorporation and other legal services.\\r\\nPrimary and secondary public education is provided by the Clark County School District, which is the fifth most populous school district in the nation. Students totaled 314,653 in grades K-12 for school year 2013ÿ2014.[73]\\r\\nThe College of Southern Nevada (the third largest community college in the United States by enrollment) is the main higher education facility in the city. Other institutions include the University of Nevada School of Medicine, with a campus in the city, and the for-profit private school Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts. Educational opportunities exist around the city; among them are the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and Nevada State College run by the Nevada System of Higher Education, Desert Research Institute, The International Academy of Design & Technology Las Vegas and Touro University Nevada.\\r\\nRTC Transit is a public transportation system providing bus service throughout Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas and other areas of the valley. Inter-city bus service to and from Las Vegas is provided by Greyhound, BoltBus, Orange Belt Stages, Tufesa, and several smaller carriers.[74] Amtrak trains have not served Las Vegas since the service via the Desert Wind was discontinued in 1997. Though no Amtrak trains have served Las Vegas since the Desert Wind was cancelled in 1997, Amtrak California operates Thruway Motorcoach dedicated service between the city and its passenger rail stations in Bakersfield, California, as well as Los Angeles Union Station via Barstow.[75]\\r\\nA bus rapid-transit link in Las Vegas called the Strip & Downtown Express (previously ACE Gold Line[76]) with limited stops and frequent service was launched in March 2010, and connects downtown Las Vegas, the Strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center.\\r\\nIn 2016, 77.1 percent of working Las Vegas residents (those living in the city, but not necessarily working in the city) commuted by driving alone. About 11 percent commuted via carpool, 3.9 percent used public transportation, and 1.4 percent walked. About 2.3 percent of Las Vegas commuters used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 4.3 of working Las Vegas residents worked at home.[77] In 2015, 10.2 percent of city of Las Vegas households were without a car, which increased slightly to 10.5 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Las Vegas averaged 1.63 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.[78]\\r\\nWith some exceptions, including Las Vegas Boulevard, Boulder Highway (SR 582) and Rancho Drive (SR 599), the majority of surface streets in Las Vegas are laid out in a grid along Public Land Survey System section lines. Many are maintained by the Nevada Department of Transportation as state highways. The street numbering system is divided by the following streets:\\r\\nInterstates 15, 515, and US 95 lead out of the city in four directions. Two major freeways ÿ Interstate 15 and Interstate 515/U.S. Route 95 ÿ cross in downtown Las Vegas. I-15 connects Las Vegas to Los Angeles, and heads northeast to and beyond Salt Lake City. I-515 goes southeast to Henderson, beyond which US 93 continues over the Mike O'CallaghanÿPat Tillman Memorial Bridge towards Phoenix, Arizona. US 95 connects the city to northwestern Nevada, including Carson City and Reno. US 93 splits from I-15 northeast of Las Vegas and goes north through the eastern part of the state, serving Ely and Wells. US 95 heads south from US 93 near Henderson through far eastern California. A partial beltway has been built, consisting of Interstate 215 on the south and Clark County 215 on the west and north. Other radial routes include Blue Diamond Road (SR 160) to Pahrump and Lake Mead Boulevard (SR 147) to Lake Mead.\\r\\nMcCarran International Airport handles international and domestic flights into the Las Vegas Valley. The airport also serves private aircraft and freight/cargo flights. Most general aviation traffic uses the smaller North Las Vegas Airport and Henderson Executive Airport.\\r\\nThe Union Pacific Railroad is the only Class I railroad providing rail freight service to the city. Until 1997, the Amtrak Desert Wind train service ran through Las Vegas using the Union Pacific Railroad tracks.","input":"What are the surrounding cities of las vegas?"},{"output":"February 10, 1978","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nVan Halen is the debut studio album by American hard rock band Van Halen. Released on February 10, 1978, the album peaked at #19 on the Billboard 200. The album became widely recognized as the band's popularity grew, selling more than 10 million copies in the United States by August 7, 1996 and being certified Diamond.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nVan Halen contains many of Van Halen's signature songs, including \\"Runnin' with the Devil,\\" the guitar solo \\"Eruption,\\" The Kinks cover \\"You Really Got Me,\\" \\"Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love\\", \\"Jamie's Cryin\\", \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\", and the cover version of John Brim's \\"Ice Cream Man\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nVan Halen began recording demos in 1976. However, a three-track tape financed by Gene Simmons attracted no interest from record labels. Guitarist Eddie Van Halen was not convinced of the quality of the material because they could not make the recordings with their own equipment.[4] Simmons left to tour with Kiss after recording the demos, but said he would try to secure Van Halen a record deal afterwards.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter recording the demos, Van Halen was offered several concerts. At a sold-out show in their hometown, Pasadena, the group's future manager, Marshall Berle, discovered the band. He and musical entrepreneur Kim Fowley paired them with punk rock band Venus and the Razorblades for a gig at the Whisky a Go Go.[6] After being well received by Berle at the Whisky a Go Go, the band gained the attention of Mo Ostin and Ted Templeman of Warner Bros. Ostin and Templeman were impressed with the band's performance at the Starwood,  and Van Halen proceeded to sign a contract with Warner.[7] The recording of their debut album began in October 1977 and lasted only three weeks.[4] With producer Ted Templeman, it was mostly recorded live.[8] \\"Runnin' with the Devil,\\" \\"Jamie's Cryin',\\" \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\" and \\"Ice Cream Man\\" contain guitar overdubs.[9] Overall, the album cost approximately $40,000 to produce.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe didnt have a ton of material,\\" recalled bassist Michael Anthony, \\"so we basically just took our live show and all the songs we knew and went for it.

The guitar pictured on the cover of the album is Eddie Van Halen's famous Frankenstrat Guitar (before he added the red paint), a Fender Stratocaster replica which is now housed in the Smithsonian Institution.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, Van Halen reached number 19 on the Billboard Top 200; their debut single, a cover of The Kinks' \\"You Really Got Me,\\" spent three weeks on the chart, peaking at number 36.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after its February 1978 release, Van Halen became regarded by fans and critics as one of rock and roll's greatest debut albums; however, its initial critical reception was mostly negative. In 1978, music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a negative review, writing: \\"For some reason Warners wants us to know that this is the biggest bar band in the San Fernando Valley?... The term becomes honorific when the music belongs in a bar. This music belongs on an aircraft carrier.\\"[23] In 1978, Rolling Stone critic Charles M. Young predicted, \\"In three years, Van Halen is going to be fat and self-indulgent and disgusting?... follow[ing] Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin right into the toilet. In the meantime, they are likely to be a big deal.\\"[24] But he also wrote that: \\"Van Halen's secret is not doing anything that's original while having the hormones to do it better than all those bands who have become fat and self-indulgent and disgusting. Edward Van Halen has mastered the art of lead/rhythm guitar in the tradition of Jimmy Page and Joe Walsh; several riffs on this record beat anything Aerosmith has come up with in years. Vocalist Dave Lee Roth manages the rare hard-rock feat of infusing the largely forgettable lyrics with energy and not sounding like a castrato at the same time. Drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony are competent and properly unobtrusive.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Rolling Stone's Holly George-Warren, with the album's release the mainstream media focused on Roth's \\"swaggering good looks and extroverted persona,\\" while fans and musicians \\"were riveted by Eddie Van Halen's guitar mastery,\\" which included \\"an array of unorthodox techniques.\\"[26] She notes that, even before the band's debut, \\"Eddie became a legend among local guitarists.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nKerrang! magazine gave the album a very positive review, and considers the album to be an \\"essential purchase.\\" They wrote, \\"IT'S DIFFICULT to overstate the effect VH's debut had upon its release.

In less than a year the album sold more than one million copies in the US alone, meaning that the album was already a great success. However, on October 22, 1984, the album went to 5G Multi-Platinum status, in other words, with that, the album still had a lot to sell. The album went to 6x Multi-Platinum on February 1, 1989, and then went to 7G Multi-Platinum on September 29, 1993. In less than a year later, on July 11, 1994, the album went to 8x Multi-Platinum, and finally, on August 7, 1996, just two years later, the album went to Diamond status by RIAA.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Van Halen album, like Van Halen's other David Lee Roth-era albumsexcepting Van Halen II, which was re-certified in 2004, to coincide with the promotion of a Warner Bros.

Despite lack of re-certification, Van Halen's 1978 debut has continued to sell prolifically, re-appearing numerous times on the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top Pop Catalog Albums charts, as recently as 2014.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Van Halen as \\"monumental\\" and \\"seismic,\\" while noting that it is typically not viewed as an \\"epochal generation shift\\" in the same way as the debut albums of Led Zeppelin, the Ramones, The Rolling Stones, and the Sex Pistols.[31] He explains, \\"The reason it's never given the same due is that there's no pretension, nothing self-conscious about it.\\"[31] He commented: \\"The still-amazing thing about Van Halen is how it sounds like it has no fathers?... Like all great originals Van Halen doesn't seem to belong to the past and it still sounds like little else, despite generations of copycats.\\"[31] In Erlewine's opinion, the album \\"set the template for how rock and roll sounded for the next decade or more.\\"[31] A retrospective review by Q noted, \\"Hit singles came later, but this dazzling debut remains their trump card.\\"[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994, Van Halen was ranked number eight in Colin Larkin's Top 50 Heavy Metal Albums.

Traditionally, polyphonic madrigals are unaccompanied; the number of voices varies from two to eight, and most frequently from three to six. It is quite distinct from the Italian Trecento madrigal of the late 13th and 14th centuries, with which it shares only the name.[1]\\r\\nMadrigals originated in Italy during the 1520s. Unlike many strophic forms of the time, most madrigals were through-composed. In the madrigal, the composer attempted to express the emotion contained in each line, and sometimes individual words, of a celebrated poem.\\r\\nThe madrigal originated in part from the frottola, in part from the resurgence in interest in vernacular Italian poetry, and also from the influence of the French chanson and polyphonic style of the motet as written by the Franco-Flemish composers who had naturalized in Italy during the period. A frottola generally would consist of music set to stanzas of text, while madrigals were through-composed. However, some of the same poems were used for both frottola and madrigals.[2] The poetry of Petrarch in particular shows up in a wide variety of genres.[2]\\r\\nIn Italy, the madrigal was the most important secular form of music of its time. The madrigal reached its formal and historical zenith by the second half of the 16th century. English and German composers, too, took up the madrigal in its heyday. After the 1630s, the madrigal began to merge with the cantata and the dialogue. With the rise of opera in the early 17th century, the aria gradually displaced the madrigal.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 16th century, several humanistic trends converged which allowed the madrigal to form. First, there was a reawakened interest in use of Italian as a vernacular language. Poet and literary theorist Pietro Bembo edited an edition of Petrarch, the great 14th-century poet, in 1501, and later published his theories on how contemporary poets could attain excellence by imitating Petrarch, and by being carefully attentive to the exact sounds of words, as well as their positioning within lines. The poetic form of the madrigal, which consisted of an irregular number of lines of usually 7 or 11 syllables, without repetition, and usually on a serious topic, came into being as a result of Bembo's influence.[1][4][5]\\r\\nSecond, Italy had long been a destination for the oltremontani (\\"those from beyond the Alps\\"), superbly-trained composers of the Franco-Flemish school, who were attracted by the culture as well as the employment opportunities at the aristocratic courts and ecclesiastical institutions ÿ Italy was, after all, the center of the Roman Catholic Church, the single most important cultural institution in Europe. These composers had mastered a serious polyphonic style suitable for setting sacred music, and also were familiar with the secular music of their homelands, music such as the chanson, which differed considerably from the lighter Italian secular styles of the late 15th and very early 16th centuries.[1]\\r\\nThird, printed secular music had become widely available in Italy due to the recent invention of moveable type and the printing press. The music being written and sung, principally the frottola but also the ballata, canzonetta, and mascherata, was light, and typically used verses of relatively low literary quality. These popular music styles used repetition and soprano-dominated chordal textures, styles considerably more simple than those used by most of the resident composers of the Franco-Flemish school. Literary tastes were changing, and the more serious verse of Bembo and his school needed a means of musical expression more flexible and open than was available in the frottola and its related forms.[1][5]\\r\\nThe first madrigals were written in Florence, either by native Florentines or by Franco-Flemish musicians in the employment of the Medici family. The madrigal did not replace the frottola right away; during the transitional decade of the 1520s, both frottole and madrigals (though not yet in name) were written and published. The earliest madrigals were probably those by Bernardo Pisano, in his 1520 Musica di messer Bernardo Pisano sopra le canzone del Petrarcha, which was also the first secular music collection ever printed containing only the works of a single composer. While none of the pieces in the collection use the name \\"madrigal\\", some of the compositions are settings of Petrarch, and the music carefully observes word placement and accent, and even contains word-painting, a feature which was to become characteristic of the later madrigal.[1]\\r\\nThe first book of madrigals labeled as such was the Madrigali de diversi musici: libro primo de la Serena of Philippe Verdelot, published in 1530 in Rome. Verdelot, a French composer, had written the pieces in the late 1520s, while he lived in Florence. He included music by both Sebastiano and Costanzo Festa, as well as Maistre Jhan of Ferrara, in addition to his own music. In 1533 and 1534 he published two books of four voice madrigals in Venice; these were to become extremely popular, so much so that their 1540 reprint was one of the most widely printed and distributed music books of the first half of the 16th century. They sold so well that Adrian Willaert made arrangements of some of these works for single voice and lute in 1536. Verdelot published madrigals for five and six voices as well, with the collection for six voices appearing in 1541.[6]\\r\\nParticularly popular was the first collection of madrigals by Jacques Arcadelt. Originally published in Venice, in 1539, it was reprinted throughout Europe for many years after, becoming the most often reprinted madrigal book of the entire era.[7] Stylistically, the music in both Arcadelt's and Verdelot's books was more akin to the French chanson than either the Italian frottola or the sacred music of the time, such as the motet. This may be unsurprising considering that the native language of both Arcadelt and Verdelot was French, and both had written chansons themselves when in their homeland; however, they were carefully attentive to text setting, in keeping with the ideas of Bembo, and they through-composed the music, writing new music for each line of text, rather than using the refrain and verse constructions that were common in French secular music.[8]\\r\\nWhile the madrigal was born in Florence and Rome, by mid-16th century the centers of musical activity had moved to Venice and other cities. The mercenaries of Charles V sacked Rome in 1527, and a period of related political turmoil in Florence, culminating in the Siege of Florence (1529ÿ30), in which Verdelot himself may have perished, reduced that city's significance as a musical center. In addition, Venice was Europe's center of music publishing; the grand Basilica of St. Mark's was just beginning the period in which it attracted musicians from all over Europe; and Pietro Bembo himself had returned to Venice in 1529. Adrian Willaert and his associates at St. Mark's ÿ younger men such as Girolamo Parabosco, Jacques Buus, Baldassare Donato, Perissone Cambio, and Cipriano de Rore ÿ were the primary representatives of madrigal composition at mid-century. Willaert preferred more complex textures to Arcadelt and Verdelot; often his madrigals were similar to motets, with their polyphonic language, although he varied texture between homophonic and polyphonic passages as necessary to highlight the text. For verse he used Petrarch in preference to Petrarch's 16th-century imitators; many of his madrigals set Petrarch's sonnets.[6][9][10]\\r\\nCipriano de Rore was the most influential of the mid-century madrigalists after Willaert. While Willaert was restrained and subtle in his text setting, striving more for homogeneity than sharp contrast, Rore was one to experiment. He used extravagant rhetorical gestures, including word-painting and unusual chromatic relationships, a trend encouraged by visionary music theorist Nicola Vicentino.[7][11] It was from Rore's musical language that \\"madrigalisms\\", so distinctive of the genre, first came about; and it was also with Rore that five-voice texture became the standard.[12]\\r\\nThe later history of the madrigal begins with Rore. All of the different trends in madrigal composition, which by the early 17th century had diverged into many different forms, are present in embryonic form in Rore's enormously influential output.[6][13]\\r\\nMany thousands of madrigals were written in Italy in the 1550s; the entire repertoire has yet to be studied exhaustively. Some famous names of the period, besides Rore, are Palestrina, who wrote some secular music early in his career; the young Orlande de Lassus, who wrote many well-known examples, including the highly experimental and chromatic Prophetiae Sibyllarum, and who, on moving to Munich in 1556, began the history of madrigal composition outside of Italy; and Philippe de Monte, the most prolific of all madrigal composers, whose first publication dates from 1554.[6][14] In style, the madrigals of the 1550s varied from the conservative and elegant style of Palestrina and some of the others working in Rome, to the highly chromatic and expressive work by Lassus, Rore, and others working in the cities of northern Italy.\\r\\nLate in the 16th century, while \\"classic\\" madrigals continued to be written throughout Italy, different styles of madrigal composition developed somewhat independently in different geographic areas. In Venice, composers such as Andrea Gabrieli continued to write madrigals in the classic tradition, but with the bright, open, polyphonic textures for which he was famous in his motets and other works. At the court of Ferrara, the presence of three uniquely gifted female singers ÿ the concerto delle donne ÿ attracted a group of composers who wrote highly ornamented madrigals, often with instrumental accompaniment, to be performed by members of this group. These composers included Luzzasco Luzzaschi, Giaches de Wert, and Lodovico Agostini, but the fame of the group was so widespread that many composers visited Ferrara both to hear and write for them, and in some cases founded similar groups of their own in other cities (for example, the Medici attempted to imitate the group in Florence, and had Alessandro Striggio write madrigals in a style like Luzzaschi's).[6][15] Rome, the ostensibly conservative center of the Roman Catholic Church, was itself the home of one of the most famous madrigal composers of the era, Luca Marenzio. Marenzio came closest to unifying all the different stylistic currents of the time, writing madrigals which attempted to capture every nuance of emotion in the poems using every musical means then available. Marenzio wrote over 400 madrigals during his short life.[16]\\r\\nYet another trend in madrigal composition after mid-century was the re-incorporation of lighter elements into the form, which had been predominantly a serious genre since its inception. Where verse by Petrarch had been the standard, and themes of love and longing and death had been typical, by the 1560s composers had begun bringing back elements of some lighter Italian forms, such as the villanella, with their dancelike rhythms and verses on carefree subjects. Some of the composers who wrote in this manner included Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, the teacher of Monteverdi, Andrea Gabrieli, and Giovanni Ferretti. The canzonetta was a specific offshoot of the madrigal in this vein.[7]\\r\\nEspecially during the late 16th century, composers were ingenious in their use of so-called \\"madrigalisms\\"?ÿ passages in which the music assigned to a particular word expresses its meaning, for example, setting riso (smile) to a passage of quick, running notes which imitate laughter, or sospiro (sigh) to a note which falls to the note below. This technique is also known as \\"word-painting.\\" While it originated in secular music, it made its way into other vocal music of the period. While this mannerism is a prominent feature of madrigals of the late 16th century, including both Italian and English, it encountered sharp criticism from some composers. Thomas Campion, writing in the preface to his first book of lute songs 1601, said of it: \\"... where the nature of everie word is precisely expresst in the Note  such childish observing of words is altogether ridiculous.\\"[17]\\r\\nThe change in the social function of the madrigal at the end of the 16th century contributed to its development into new dramatic forms. Since its invention, it had served two principal roles: as a pleasant private entertainment for small groups of skilled amateur musicians; and as an adjunct to large ceremonial public performances. The first use, the private one, was by far the most common throughout the life of the madrigal, and it was through these enthusiastic gatherings of amateurs that the madrigal acquired its fame. However, in the last two decades of the century, virtuoso professional singers began to replace amateurs, and composers wrote music for them of greater dramatic force. Not only was this music harder to sing, but the sentiments expressed tended to require soloists rather than equal members of an ensemble in order to be dramatically convincing. Also during this period a division between performers and passive audiences ÿ not the large audiences present at a public ceremonial spectacle, as seen earlier in the century, but relatively small, intimate gatherings, with performers and listeners, a situation recognizably modern ÿ began to be seen, especially in such progressive cultural centers as Ferrara and Mantua. Much of what was once expressed in a madrigal in 1590, could twenty years later be expressed by an aria in the new form of opera; however, the madrigal continued to live on into the 17th century, in several forms, including old-style madrigals for many voices; a solo form with instrumental accompaniment; and the concertato madrigal, of which Claudio Monteverdi was the most famous practitioner.[6]\\r\\nNaples was the home of the nobleman Carlo Gesualdo, who killed his wife and her lover in flagrante delicto and wrote some of the most extravagantly expressive and harmonically experimental music prior to the 19th century.[18] Gesualdo's style followed directly from Luzzaschi's, and he named the older composer as his mentor: the two worked together at Ferrara in the early 1590s, giving Gesualdo ample opportunity to absorb the chromaticism and textural contrasts of the Ferrarese, including Luzzaschi and Alfonso Fontanelli. Gesualdo published six books of madrigals during his lifetime, as well as some sacred music in madrigalian style (for example the Tenebrae Responsories of 1611). Very few madrigalists followed Gesualdo down this path of mannerism and extreme chromaticism, although composers such as Antonio Cifra, Sigismondo d'India, and Domenico Mazzocchi selectively used some of his techniques.[6][19][20] Michelangelo Rossi, whose two books of unaccompanied madrigals (written c. 1620s) display a sustained use of extreme chromaticism, was perhaps Gesualdo's most direct successor.[21]\\r\\nOf all the composers of madrigals of the late 16th century, none was as central a figure as Claudio Monteverdi, who was often credited as the principal actor in the transition from Renaissance music to Baroque music. In his long career, he wrote nine books of madrigals, which showed the transition from the late 16th-century polyphonic style to the monodic and concertato style, accompanied by basso continuo, of the early Baroque.\\r\\nAs expressive as Gesualdo, he avoided the extremes of chromaticism employed by that composer and instead focused on the dramatic possibilities inherent in the form. His fifth and sixth books include not only polyphonic madrigals for equal voices in the manner of the late 16th century, but also madrigals with parts for solo voice accompanied by continuo; additionally these works make use of unprepared dissonances and recitative-like passages, foreshadowing the eventual absorption of the solo madrigal into the aria. These madrigals also show the influence of monody, developing at the same time: Manfred Bukofzer called the development of the recitative-like 'stile rappresentativo' around 1600 as \\"the most important turning point in the entire history of music.\\"[22]\\r\\nTo Monteverdi, the words must be \\"the mistress of the harmony\\", and he explained this doctrine in his preface to his Fifth Book of Madrigals with his coinage of the term seconda pratica, in response to the fierce criticism of Giovanni Artusi, who defended the polyphonic style of the 16th century with its controlled dissonance and equal voice parts, and attacked the \\"barbaric\\" new style.[23][24]\\r\\nDuring the first decade of the 17th century the madrigal moved away from the old ideal of an a cappella vocal composition for equally balanced voices, into a piece for one or more voices with instrumental accompaniment. The soprano and bass line became more important to the texture than the inner voices, if they existed at all as independent parts; functional tonality began to develop; composers treated dissonance more freely than before; and dramatic contrasts between groupings of voices and instruments became increasingly common. In the 17th century madrigal, two separate trends can be identified: the solo madrigal, which involved a solo voice with basso continuo, and madrigals for two or more voices, also with basso continuo. In addition, some composers continued to write ensemble madrigals in the older style, especially in England.[23][25] While the harmonic and dramatic changes in the madrigal around 1600 may seem abrupt, the addition of instruments was not a new development. Instrumental performance of madrigals had already been widespread for much of the 16th century, either in arrangements or in performances mixed with singers. As madrigals had originally been largely designed for performance by groups of talented amateurs, without a passive audience, instruments were also commonly used to fill in for missing parts. Instrumentation during the period was rarely specified; indeed Monteverdi indicated in his fifth and sixth book of madrigals that the basso seguente, the instrumental bass part, was optional in the ensemble madrigals. The most commonly used instruments for playing the bass line and filling in any inner parts, at this time, were the lute, theorbo (chitarrone), and harpsichord.[23][26]\\r\\nOne of the prominent composers of madrigals in the solo with continuo style, related to monody and descended directly from the experimental music of the Florentine Camerata, was Giulio Caccini, who published the first collection of solo madrigals with his Le nuove musiche in 1601/2. The point was anti-contrapuntal: Caccini and the Camerata believed that the words needed to be heard above all else, and polyphonic, evenly balanced voices easily obscured intelligibility. After Caccini, composers such as Marco da Gagliano, Sigismondo d'India, and Claudio Saracini published collections of their own; while Caccini's music was almost entirely diatonic, some of these later composers, particular d'India, wrote their solo madrigals in a more experimental chromatic idiom. Monteverdi himself wrote only one solo madrigal, which he published in his Seventh Book of Madrigals in 1619. While it uses only one singing voice, it employs three separate groups of instruments ÿ a considerable advance from the simple voice and basso continuo compositions of Caccini around 1600.[26]\\r\\nSolo madrigals in the monodic style began to go out of fashion shortly before 1620, to be replaced by the aria. The last book of solo madrigals which did not contain any arias appeared in 1618; that was also the first year in which a group of arias was published which contained no madrigals. After that date arias outnumbered madrigals, and both Saracini and d'India, previously prolific composers of solo madrigals, ceased publishing them in the early 1620s.[27]\\r\\nTwo collections of the late 1630s serve as a summation of late madrigal practice. Domenico Mazzocchi's 1638 book splits madrigals into continuo and ensemble works specifically intended to be performed a cappella; Mazzocchi's instructions are precise, and he even includes, for the first time in any printed music collection, symbols for crescendo and decrescendo. However, these madrigals were not intended for performance so much as study, and as such show that the form was being viewed in retrospect.[28] Monteverdi's Book Eight, of the same year, contains some of the most famous madrigals of the entire epoch, including the enormous Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda, a dramatic composition much like a secular oratorio. Among other innovations in this work is the stile concitato ÿ the \\"agitated style\\", which uses, among other things, string tremolo. The pieces in Monteverdi's Book Eight, written over at least two decades, show just about every development in the madrigal since 1600.[29]\\r\\nEventually the madrigal vanished as an independent form. The solo madrigal was supplanted by the aria and solo cantata; the ensemble madrigal by the cantata and dialogue. By 1640 few madrigals were still being published, and opera had become the predominant dramatic musical form.[23]\\r\\nIn England, the madrigal became hugely popular after the publication of Nicholas Yonge's Musica Transalpina in 1588, a collection of Italian madrigals fitted with English translations; this publication initiated an entire school of madrigal composition in England. The unaccompanied madrigal survived longer in England than in the rest of Europe. There, composers continued to produce works in the late-16th century style of the genre after the form had gone out of fashion on the Continent.\\r\\nMadrigals influenced secular music in many other parts of Europe, and in some areas composers wrote actual madrigals, either in Italian or in their own languages. The amount of influence was roughly inversely proportional to the strength of the local secular musical tradition: for example France, which had the robust and sophisticated form of the chanson during the 16th century, never adopted the madrigal ÿ they did not need it. However some French composers, especially those who had been to Italy, used madrigalian techniques in their writing. These composers included cosmopolitan figures such as Orlande de Lassus, who wrote in at least four languages, as well as Frenchmen such as Claude Le Jeune.[30]\\r\\nThe Netherlands was a major center of music publishing, and since Italian madrigals were easily available from publishing houses, some native composers wrote works either in influence or imitation. Cornelis Verdonck, Hubert Waelrant, and Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck all composed madrigals in Italian.[30]\\r\\nGermany was the home of several prolific composers of madrigals, including Lassus (in Munich) and Philippe de Monte (Vienna), the most prolific madrigal composer of all. Many Germans had gone south to study in Italy, particularly with the Venetians; Hans Leo Hassler studied with Andrea Gabrieli, and Heinrich Schtz with Monteverdi. Each brought back to Germany what they learned, and wrote madrigals or madrigalian pieces both in Italian and German. Musicians from the courts of Denmark and Poland also studied the Italian style either in their home countries or in Italy; Marenzio himself had worked in Poland near the end of his life.[30] Caspar Ziegler from the University of Wittenberg, who collaborated with Schtz, wrote a treatise Von den Madrigalen, published in 1653.[31]\\r\\nIn early 18th century England, singing of madrigals was revived by catch and glee clubs, and later by the formation of institutions such as the Madrigal Society in London formed in 1741.[32] As a result of the printing and singing of madrigals, particularly English ones, the madrigal became the best-known form of Renaissance secular music in England in the 19th century, even before the rediscovery of works by composers such as Palestrina.[33]\\r\\nChoral groups continue to sing madrigals to the present day. The Philippine Madrigal Singers, which specializes in this genre, is an internationally awarded choir.\\r\\nThe King's Singers is an award-winning all-male madrigal group performing internationally. It specializes both in traditional madrigal pieces as well as contemporary music.\\r\\nThe Elizabethan Madrigal Singers, a madrigal choir based in Aberystwyth, Wales, is the university chamber choir for Aberystwyth University, as well as being the oldest society at the university.\\r\\nIn the United States madrigal choirs are particularly popular with high school and college groups, and often sing in the context of a madrigal dinner. This may also include a play, Renaissance costumes, and instrumental chamber music. The focus is generally on the repertoire of the English Madrigal School.\\r\\nThe first composer trying to revive the art of madrigal singing in the 20th century, was Paul Hindemith.

It is located on the Palm Beach barrier island, with the Atlantic Ocean to the east and Floridas Intracoastal Waterway to the west.\\r\\nAt the time of her death in 1973, Post bequeathed the property to the National Park Service, hoping it could be used for state visits or as a Winter White House. However, because the costs of maintaining the property exceeded the funds provided by Post, and it was difficult to secure the facility (as it is located in the flight path of Palm Beach Airport), the property was returned to the Post Foundation by an Act of Congress in 1981.[5]\\r\\nIn 1985, Mar-a-Lago was purchased by businessman (and later 45th U.S. President) Donald Trump[6] and his then-wife Ivana Trump was put in charge of running the property.[7] Trump retained Mar-a-Lago through his two divorces, and his family maintains private quarters in a separate, closed-off area of the house and grounds.[8] Trump has frequently visited there since he was elected president,[9] referring to it as the Winter White House and his \\"Southern White House\\". It is the 20th largest mansion in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company identifies the name Mar-a-Lago as Spanish for \\"Sea-to-Lake.\\"[10]\\r\\nMarjorie Merriweather Post, heiress to the Post Cereals business, built the house with her husband Edward F. Hutton. She hired Marion Sims Wyeth to design it, and Joseph Urban to create interior design and exterior decorations.[11][12] Post spent $7 million ($90 million today) and it was finished in 1927.[13] Post, who died in 1973, had willed the 17-acre (6.9?ha) estate to the United States government as a Winter White House for presidents and visiting foreign dignitaries.[14] Richard Nixon preferred the Florida White House in Key Biscayne, however, and Jimmy Carter was not interested. The federal government soon realized the immense cost of maintenance, and the difficulty maintaining security for diplomats,[15] and returned it to the Post Foundation in 1981, which listed it for sale for $20 million. Dina Merrill and Post's two other daughters did not maintain the property, expecting to sell it,[16] but there was so little interest that the city approved its demolition to build smaller homes.[17] Mar-a-Lago was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1980.[3][18][19]\\r\\nDonald Trump learned about the estate after unsuccessfully trying to purchase and combine two apartments in Palm Beach for his family. According to Trump, he offered the Post family $25 million for it, but they rejected it. Trump purchased the land between Mar-a-Lago and the ocean from Jack C. Massey, the founder of KFC, for $2 million,[20] stating he intended to build a home that would block Mar-a-Lago's beach view. The threat caused interest in the property to decline, and Trump ended up getting the property for $7 million in 1985.[21][16] He renovated the estate, adding a 20,000-square-foot (1,900?m2) ballroom[17] to the 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, a 29-foot-long (8.8?m) pietra dura marble top dining table, 12 fireplaces, and three bomb shelters. The club also has five clay tennis courts and a waterfront pool.\\r\\nIn the early 1990s, Trump faced financial difficulties. While negotiating with his bankers, he promised to divide Mar-a-Lago into smaller properties, alarming Palm Beach residents; the city council rejected his plan to do so. Trump instead turned the estate into a private club thatunlike other Palm Beach old money resorts like the Bath and Tennis Club and Everglades Clubaccepted as members Jews, blacks, and, as one Everglades member said,[who?] \\"people who try to call attention to themselves\\". The new club hosted concerts by Cline Dion and Billy Joel, had beauty-pageant contestants as guests, and violated local noise ordinances. Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley spent their honeymoon at Mar-a-Lago.[17][16][22]\\r\\nOn April 18, 2012, the American Institute of Architects' Florida Chapter ranked Mar-a-Lago fifth on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places.[23]\\r\\nMar-a-Lago has frequently hosted the International Red Cross Ball, an annual \\"white tie, tails, and tiara\\" ball.[citation needed] Founded by Post, it has a history of attracting wealthy socialites and ambassadors from across the world in support of the mission of the American Red Cross.\\r\\nPresident Trump has referred to Mar-a-Lago as his \\"Winter White House\\"[24] and alternately the \\"Southern White House\\".[25]. It has a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) for communications with the White House Situation Room and Pentagon.[26]\\r\\nTrump's first visit to Mar-a-Lago as President of the United States took place on the weekend of February 3ÿ6, 2017. On Saturday, he hosted the Diamond Red Cross Ball at Mar-a-Lago Club,[27] while on Sunday, he watched Super Bowl LI at Trump International Golf Club (West Palm Beach). The estimated cost (over US$3 million) of the weekend garnered some scrutiny as Trump, before being elected, had regularly criticized President Obama for taking allegedly expensive taxpayer-funded vacations.[28]\\r\\nOn the weekend of February 10ÿ12, 2017, President Trump and his wife Melania hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinz Abe and his wife. This was the first use of Mar-a-Lago to entertain an international leader,[29] and the occasion for one of his first international security crises, that of a North Korean missile launch. Trump and Abe conferred in full view of the other diners.[30]\\r\\nDuring the third consecutive weekend visit to Mar-a-Lago on February 17ÿ20, Trump conducted a campaign rally at the Orlando Melbourne International Airport.[31] He also conducted interviews for a replacement National Security Advisor and named General H. R. McMaster as Flynn's successor on February 20, 2017.[32]\\r\\nAfter President Trump's fourth weekend visit on March 3ÿ5, questions were raised about the access his paying club members have to him and his entourage. A number of Democratic senators asked the President to release visitor logs of Mar-a-Lago and as well as a list of the members of the private club.[33] Subsequently, the \\"Mar-a-Lago Act\\" was introduced, legislation requiring publication of logs of visitors at the White House and other places where the president conducts business.[34] A lawsuit filed by a National Security Archive analyst, Kate Doyle, in conjunction with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and CREW requested the visitor logs from Mar-a-Lago be released to the public. In July 2017 a judge ordered that these logs be released in September .[35]\\r\\nTrump's fifth presidential visit took place on March 17ÿ18. Guests included Melania's parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs.[36]\\r\\nDuring his next visit April 6ÿ9, President Trump hosted the Chinese leader Xi Jinping for the first two days.[37][38][39] At Mar-a-Lago the decision to strike a Syrian airfield was made.[39] The following Easter weekend was also spent with family members at Mar-a-Lago.[40]\\r\\nOn April 4, 2017, prior to President Xi's visit, ShareAmerica, a Web site run by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of International Information Programs, published a blog post describing Mar-a-Lago's history.[41] On April 5, 2017, the U.S. Embassy in the United Kingdom's website shared snippets of the original blog post on its own blog, and the U.S. Embassy in Albania's Facebook page shared the original post.[42][43] On April 24, 2017, Democrats Senator Ron Wyden, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and ethics observers like former Ambassador Norman Eisen, questioned the use of official government resources promoting a private property owned by Trump.[44][45][46][47] By April 25, 2017 ShareAmerica and both U.S. Embassies in the United Kingdom and Albania removed their respective posts. ShareAmerica, replaced their post with the following statement, \\"The intention of the article was to inform the public about where the president has been hosting world leaders. We regret any misperception and have removed the post.\\"[48]\\r\\nWith the seasonal closing of Mar-a-Lago by May 14 ahead of the Atlantic hurricane season, President Trump uses Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey as his preferred retreat location during the Summer months (calling it his \\"Summer White House\\") [49]\\r\\nIn November 2017 Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago for his first presidential Thanksgiving celebration,[50] and one month later he returned for his tenth presidential visit during his Christmas vacation.[51]\\r\\nWhen the President is in residence the Palm Beach region becomes a zone of temporary flight restrictions[52] affecting flights and air operations severely within a 30 nautical mile (55.56?km) radius.[53] Coast Guard and Secret Service secure the two waterway approaches, ocean and lake, and Secret Service cordons off streets to Mar-a-Lago during the President's visits.[54] By the third weekend in February 2017, nearby Palm Beach County Park Airport (Lantana Airport) had been shut down for three consecutive weekends, accumulating significant financial losses for multiple businesses.[55]\\r\\nThe primary business occupying the estate is the Mar-a-Lago Club, which operates as resort and hotel for dues-paying members, and rents out estate venues for private events. Membership at the Mar-a-Lago Club required a $200,000 initiation fee up until 2012 when it was lowered to $100,000. Sources close to the resort indicated the cut was in response to reduced demand following the Bernie Madoff scandal which affected many affluent Palm Beach residents.[56] The fee was returned to $200,000 in January 2017 following the election of Donald Trump as president[56] with $14,000 annual dues.[57] Overnight guests pay up to $2,000 a night.[17] According to financial disclosure forms filed by Donald Trump, the Mar-a-Lago Club realized $29.7 million in gross revenues in the period June 2015 to May 2016.[58]\\r\\nThe club has nearly 500 paying members (with a cap of 500) and admits twenty to forty new members a year.[59][60] Members include oil executive Bill Koch, financier Thomas Peterffy, New Jersey Democratic Party leader George Norcross, lobbyist Kenneth Duberstein, real estate developers Bruce E. Toll and Richard LeFrak, media executive Christopher Ruddy, talk show host Howie Carr, talk show host Michael Savage/s wife, and NFL coach Bill Belichick.[60]\\r\\nThe club holds an annual New Years Eve party, described in Daily Mail by journalist and author Ronald Kessler, who has known Donald Trump for two decades: \\"The New Year's Eve party was held in that ballroom [described in Kessler's book The Season: Inside Palm Beach and America's Richest Society], with almost 700 guests who paid $1,000 per couple. First came hors d'oeuvres and champagne on the terrace overlooking the pool, always heated to 78 degrees, like the second pool right on the ocean. Cocktail shrimp, stone crab claws, cold lobster, oysters on the half shell, sushi, and caviar dished onto blini were among the offerings. After that, the guests swanned over to the ballroom for dinner and dancing. Dinner included truffle and ricotta ravioli and filet mignon and scallops. The bubbly: from Trump's own Charlottesville, Virginia vineyard.\\"[61] A second article by Kessler in Daily Mail in February 2016 predicted that Trump would operate as president the way he runs Mar-a-Lago.[62]\\r\\nIn \\"A Roadmap to Trumps Washington\\", Kessler described the carrot-and-stick approach Trump used to get his Mar-a-Lago estate approved as a club by Palm Beach Town Council members and predicted he would operate in the same manner as president to win over support for his agenda.[63] In \\"The Anatomy of a Trump Decision\\", Kessler depicted how Trump makes decisions by focusing on his decision to turn his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach into a private club.[64]\\r\\nAs of February 2017, President Trump is considering at least three club members for ambassadorships.[60]\\r\\nIn protest of Trump's remarks on the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, six nonprofit organizations canceled scheduled gala events at the club. The charities canceling included the American Red Cross and the American Cancer Society.[65]\\r\\nOn October 3, 2006, Trump raised a 20-by-30-foot (6.1 by 9.1?m) American flag on an 80-foot (24?m) flagpole at Mar-a-Lago. Town zoning officials asked Trump to adhere to town zoning codes that limit flagpoles to a height of 42 feet (13?m).[66] This dispute led the town council of Palm Beach to charge Trump $1,250 for every day that the flag stayed up. Trump filed a lawsuit against the Town of Palm Beach. Trump eventually dropped his lawsuit over the flag, and in exchange the town waived its fines.[67] As part of a court-ordered mediation, Trump was allowed to file for a permit and keep a pole that was both 10 feet (3.0?m) shorter than the original pole and located on a different spot on his lawn. The agreement also required him to donate $100,000 to veterans charities, as well as resulted in a change to town ordinances allowing out-of-town enrollees in club membership.[68]\\r\\nIn December 1997, Trump filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. In his suit Trump accused the town of discriminating against Mar-a-Lago for allowing black and Jewish members, groups not typically welcome in the area's other clubs.[16]\\r\\nAccording to Vanity Fair, \\"Trump and his attorney had already implied that he and his club had been discriminated against because many of its members were Jewish, and, worse, that the council members who had placed the conditions on him had not placed those restrictions on their own clubs.\\"[16]\\r\\nTrump has repeatedly filed lawsuits against Palm Beach County over aircraft going to and from Palm Beach International Airport (PBI) allegedly affecting Mar-a-Lago.[69]\\r\\nTrump first filed such a lawsuit in 1995; that action was settled in 1996, with the county agreeing to collaborate with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and to change flight patterns so the noisiest jet aircraft flew over a wider area.[69] As part of the settlement, Trump leased 215 acres from the county, on which he built the 18-hole Trump International Golf Club.[16] In July 2010, Trump filed another lawsuit aiming to stop the airport from constructing a second commercial runway.[70] That suit was dismissed.[69]\\r\\nTrump filed a third suit against the county in January 2015, seeking $100 million in damages for \\"creating an unreasonable amount of noise, emissions and pollutants at Mar-a-Lago\\".[69] Trump claims that officials pressured the FAA to direct air traffic to PBI over Mar-a-Lago in a \\"deliberate and malicious\\" act.[71]\\r\\nIn November 2015, a Florida Circuit Court judge ruled against most of Trump's arguments, dismissing four of the six claims and allowing the others to proceed.[69] Trump dropped the lawsuit after winning the presidency, as the estate will likely have a no-fly zone imposed by the FAA.[72][16] In January 2017, Palm Beach exempted Mar-a-Lago from a ban on landing helicopters on residential properties while Trump is president, including his own fleet and Marine One.[73]","input":"Where is mara lago golf course in florida?"},{"output":"\\"The Million Dollar Quartet\\"","context":"Elvis Presley recorded at least 24 songs at Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, between 1953 and 1955. The recordings reflect the wide variety of music that could be heard in Memphis at the time: blues, rhythm & blues, gospel, country & western, hillbilly, and bluegrass. Because of the recordings' historical significance in the foundation of rock and roll music, they were inducted into the US Congress's National Recording Registry in 2002.[1]\\r\\nOf the 24 known tapes, 22 survive. Ten were released by Sun as Elvis' first five singles between 1954 and 1955. With the exception of the first four songs, which were demos recorded at Presley's expense, all of the songs were produced by Sam Phillips and featured Scotty Moore on guitar and Bill Black on bass.\\r\\nA year after Presley joined RCA Victor, he had a spontaneous informal session with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis when visiting the Sun studio. This meeting was recorded on December 4, 1956, and dubbed the Million Dollar Quartet by the local newspaper the next day. These sessions are not generally included when reference is made to \\"Elvis's Sun Sessions\\", however.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 18, 1953, Presley first went to the Memphis Recording Service at the Sun Record Company, now commonly known as Sun Studio.[2] He paid $3.98 to record the first of two double-sided demo acetates, \\"My Happiness\\" and \\"That's When Your Heartaches Begin.\\" Presley reportedly gave the acetate to his mother as a much-belated extra birthday present,[3] although many biographers suggest that Presley simply wanted to get noticed by Sun owner Sam Phillips. These suggestions are strengthened by the fact that the Presleys did not own a record player at the time.[4][5] That one-off acetate has since been valued at $500,000 by Record Collector magazine. Returning to Sun Studios on January 4, 1954, he recorded a second acetate, \\"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\\"/\\"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You.\\"[6]\\r\\nPhillips had already cut the first records by blues artists such as Howlin' Wolf and Junior Parker.[7] He thought a combination of black blues and boogie-woogie music would be very popular among white people, if presented in the right way.[8] In the spring, Presley auditioned for an amateur gospel quartet called The Songfellows, as one of the group was leaving and they were seeking a replacement.[9] However, following Presley's audition, the original group member decided to stay.[9] In May, Presley auditioned at the Hi-Hat in Memphis as a vocalist for a band. Eddie Bond, the owner of the Hi-Hat, turned him down.[10]\\r\\nWhen Phillips acquired a demo recording of \\"Without You\\" and was unable to identify the vocalist, his assistant, Marion Keisker, reminded him about the young truck driver. She called him on May 26, 1954. Presley was not able to do justice to the song (the original acetate of the song that Phillips presented to Elvis resides in the Memphis State University collection),[11] but Phillips asked him to perform some of the many other songs he knew. After running through a few songs, Presley expressed an interest in finding a band to play with, and Phillips invited local Western swing musicians Winfield \\"Scotty\\" Moore (electric guitar) and Bill Black (slap bass) to audition Presley. They did so on Sunday, July 4, 1954, at Moore's house. Neither musician was overly impressed, but they agreed a studio session would be useful to explore his potential.[12]\\r\\nOn July 5, 1954, the trio met at Sun studios to rehearse and record a handful of songs. According to Moore, the first song they recorded was \\"I Love You Because\\", but, after a few other country-oriented songs that weren't all that impressive, they decided to take a break.[13] During the break, Presley began \\"acting the fool\\" with Arthur Crudup's \\"That's All Right (Mama)\\", a blues song.[14] When the other two musicians joined in, Phillips got them to restart and began taping. This was the bright, upbeat sound he had been looking for.[15] Black remarked, \\"Damn. Get that on the radio and they'll run us out of town.\\"[16] The group recorded four songs during that session, including bluegrass musician Bill Monroe's \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\", which he had written and recorded as a slow waltz. Sources credit Bill Black with initiating the song, with Presley and Moore joining in. They ended up with a fast version of the song in 4/4 time. After an early take, Phillips can be heard on tape saying: \\"Fine, man. Hell, that's differentthat's a pop song now, just about.\\"[17]\\r\\nTo gauge professional and public reaction, Phillips took several acetates of the session to DJ Dewey Phillips (no relation) of Memphis radio station WHBQ's Red, Hot And Blue show. \\"That's All Right\\" subsequently received its first play on July 8, 1954.[18] A week later, Sun had received some 6,000 advanced orders for \\"That's All Right\\"/\\"Blue Moon of Kentucky,\\" which was released on July 19, 1954. From August 18 through December 8, \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" was consistently higher on the charts, and then both sides began to chart across the South.[19]\\r\\nAfter several performances with other bands, Presley arranged for Moore and Black to be his regular back-up group, giving them each 25% of the takings.[20] Moore and Black were originally members of their own band, The Starlight Wranglers, but after the success of \\"That's All Right\\", jealousy within the group forced them to split.[21]\\r\\nOver the next 15 months, the trio would release five singles, tour extensively across the South, and appear regularly on the Louisiana Hayride; it was the biggest rival to the Grand Ole Opry at the time. They had originally auditioned for the Opry in October 1954, but they failed to impress the people in charge, or the audience, and were not invited back. Several biographers cite Jim Denny, talent agent at the Opry, as the man who told Presley that he should \\"go back to driving a truck\\".[22]\\r\\nThe trio would record at Sun together until November 1955, when Phillips sold Presley's contract to RCA Victor for $40,000; it was, at the time, the highest sum ever paid for a recording contract. Sun had permission to keep pressing the singles until January 1, 1956, and RCA Victor released Presley's first five Sun singles nationally. In January 1956, Presley recorded \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", his first RCA Victor single. He would return to Sun studios regularly over the next few months, visiting with Phillips and meeting many of the label's new artists.\\r\\nAlthough Presley never officially recorded for Sun again, he was caught on tape during an impromptu jamming session on December 4, 1956. Presley had arrived during a Carl Perkins recording session, which also featured a young Jerry Lee Lewis on piano, and a new artist named Johnny Cash watching on. During a break in recording, Presley sat at the piano and began to sing along with Perkins, Lewis and Cash. Phillips kept his tape recorder running, and, seeing an opportunity to promote another of his new acts, he arranged for a reporter to cover the event. The recordings would eventually be known as \\"The Million Dollar Quartet\\".\\r\\nDuring Presley's tenure at Sun Records, he recorded two demo recordings in Lubbock, Texas: \\"Fool, Fool, Fool\\" and \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\", which were released for the first time by RCA in the 1990s.

The afternoon became a jam session with Carl Perkins (then already famous for his \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\"), Jerry Lee Lewis (relatively unknown at the time), and Johnny Cash (not heard on the tapes, although he does appear on the cover photo). The taping was largely unintended by the quartet; they were just singing the songs they had in mind. About 40 titles are recorded, most of them incomplete.

The reference work Elvis: The Illustrated Record by Roy Carr and Mick Farren lists the following songs that were, as of 1982, believed to have been recorded by Elvis at Sun Records but as of 2009 remain unreleased and unaccounted for in the official record:[37]\\r\\nMost of the tapes, including the private single, the Million Dollar Quartet and alternate takes have been released.\\r\\nTen songs, making five singles, were originally released on the Sun label. These records (in both 45 RPM and 78 RPM formats) are among the most valuable of Elvis' output, fetching four figures in excellent condition:\\r\\nAfter signing with RCA, the same songs, in the same b/w combination, were re-released by RCA. (December 1955). The songs were available on 78 RPM and 45 RPM, which explains the two ordering-numbers 20/47, respectively:\\r\\nThe same pairings were later reissued as part of RCA's Gold Standard series in five different label formats: Black label with dog at top (September 1958), black label with dog on left side (September 1965), orange label (November 1968), red label (September 1970), and black label with dog in upper right hand corner (September 1976)\\r\\nOn January 27, 1956, the first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" b/w \\"I Was the One\\" was released, giving Elvis a nationwide breakthrough.

The battle was the first major defeat of the war for the Americans, and it came with heavy losses. General Richard Montgomery was killed, Benedict Arnold was wounded, and Daniel Morgan and more than 400 men were taken prisoner. The city's garrison, a motley assortment of regular troops and militia led by Quebec's provincial governor, General Guy Carleton, suffered a small number of casualties.\\r\\nMontgomery's army had captured Montreal on November 13, and early in December they joined a force led by Arnold, whose men had made an arduous trek through the wilderness of northern New England. Governor Carleton had escaped from Montreal to Quebec, the Americans' next objective, and last-minute reinforcements arrived to bolster the city's limited defenses before the attacking force's arrival. Concerned that expiring enlistments would reduce his force, Montgomery made the end-of-year attack in a blinding snowstorm to conceal his army's movements. The plan was for separate forces led by Montgomery and Arnold to converge in the lower city before scaling the walls protecting the upper city. Montgomery's force turned back after he was killed by cannon fire early in the battle, but Arnold's force penetrated further into the lower city. Arnold was injured early in the attack, and Morgan led the assault in his place before he became trapped in the lower city and was forced to surrender. Arnold and the Americans maintained an ineffectual blockade of the city until spring, when British reinforcements arrived.\\r\\nIn the battle and the following siege, French-speaking Canadians were active on both sides of the conflict. The American forces received supplies and logistical support from local residents, and the city's defenders included locally raised militia. When the Americans retreated, they were accompanied by a number of their supporters; those who remained behind were subjected to a variety of punishments after the British re-established control over the province.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775, a small enterprising force led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold captured the key fortress at Ticonderoga on May 10. Arnold followed up the capture with a raid on Fort Saint-Jean not far from Montreal, alarming the British leadership there.[6] These actions stimulated both British and rebel leaders to consider the possibility of an invasion of the Province of Quebec by the rebellious forces of the Second Continental Congress, and Quebec's governor, General Guy Carleton, began mobilizing the provincial defenses. After first rejecting the idea of an attack on Quebec, the Congress authorized the Continental Army's commander of its Northern Department, Major General Philip Schuyler, to invade the province if he felt it necessary. As part of an American propaganda offensive, letters from Congress and the New York Provincial Assembly were circulated throughout the province, promising liberation from their oppressive government.[7] Benedict Arnold, passed over for command of the expedition, convinced General George Washington to authorize a second expedition through the wilderness of what is now the state of Maine directly to Quebec City, capital of the province.[8]\\r\\nThe Continental Army began moving into Quebec in September 1775. Its goal, as stated in a proclamation by General Schuyler, was to \\"drive away, if possible, the troops of Great Britain\\" that \\"under the orders of a despotic ministry?... aim to subject their fellow-citizens and brethren to the yoke of a hard slavery.\\"[9] Brigadier General Richard Montgomery led the force from Ticonderoga and Crown Point up Lake Champlain, successfully besieging Fort St. Jean, and capturing Montreal on November 13. Arnold led a force of 1,100 men from Cambridge, Massachusetts on the expedition through Maine towards Quebec shortly after Montgomery's departure from Ticonderoga.[10]\\r\\nOne significant expectation of the American advance into Quebec was that the large French Catholic Canadien population of the province and city would rise against British rule. Since the British took control of the province, during the French and Indian War in 1760, there had been difficulties and disagreements between the local French Catholics and the Protestant English-speaking British military and civilian administrations. However, these tensions had been eased by the passage of the Quebec Act of 1774, which restored land and many civil rights to the Canadiens (an act which had been condemned by the thirteen rebelling colonies). The majority of Quebec's French inhabitants chose not to play an active role in the American campaign, in large part because, encouraged by their clergy, they had come to accept British rule with its backing of the Catholic Church and preservation of French culture.[11]\\r\\nGeneral Carleton had begun preparing the province's defenses immediately on learning of Arnold's raid on St. Jean. Although Carleton concentrated most of his modest force at Fort St. Jean, he left small garrisons of British regular army troops at Montreal and Quebec.[12] Carleton followed the American invasion's progress, occasionally receiving intercepted communications between Montgomery and Arnold. Lieutenant Governor Hector Cramah, in charge of Quebec's defenses while Carleton was in Montreal, organized a militia force of several hundred to defend the town in September. He pessimistically thought they were \\"not much to be depended on\\", estimating that only half were reliable.[13] Cramah also made numerous requests for military reinforcements to the military leadership in Boston, but each of these came to nought. Several troop ships were blown off course and ended up in New York, and Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, the commander of the fleet in Boston, refused to release ships to transport troops from there to Quebec because the approaching winter would close the Saint Lawrence River.[14]\\r\\nWhen definitive word reached Quebec on November 3 that Arnold's march had succeeded and that he was approaching the city, Cramah began tightening the guard and had all boats removed from the south shore of the Saint Lawrence.[15] Word of Arnold's approach resulted in further militia enlistments, increasing the ranks to 1,200 or more.[13] Two ships arrived on November 3, followed by a third the next day, carrying militia volunteers from St. John's Island and Newfoundland that added about 120 men to the defense. A small convoy under the command of the frigate HMS?Lizard also arrived that day, from which a number of marines were added to the town's defenses.[16]\\r\\nOn November 10, Lieutenant Colonel Allen Maclean, who had been involved in an attempt to lift the siege at St. Jean, arrived with 200 men of his Royal Highland Emigrants. They had intercepted communications from Arnold to Montgomery near Trois-Rivires, and hurried to Quebec to help with its defense. The arrival of this experienced force boosted the morale of the town militia, and Maclean immediately took charge of the defenses.[17]\\r\\nIn the wake of the fall of Fort St. Jean, Carleton abandoned Montreal and returned to Quebec City by ship, narrowly escaping capture.[18] Upon his arrival on November 19, he immediately took command. Three days later, he issued a proclamation that any able-bodied man in the town who did not take up arms would be assumed to be a rebel or a spy, and would be treated as such. Men not taking up arms were given four days to leave.[19] As a result, about 500?inhabitants (including 200?British and 300?Canadians) joined the defense.[20]\\r\\nCarleton addressed the weak points of the town's defensive fortifications: he had two log barricades and palisades erected along the Saint Lawrence shoreline, within the area covered by his cannons; he assigned his forces to defensive positions along the walls and the inner defenses;[21] and he made sure his inexperienced militia were under strong leadership.[22]\\r\\nThe men Arnold chose for his expedition were volunteers drawn from New England companies serving in the Siege of Boston. They were formed into two battalions for the expedition; a third battalion was composed of riflemen from Pennsylvania and Virginia under Captain Daniel Morgan's command.[23] The trek through the wilderness of Maine was long and difficult. The conditions were wet and cold, and the journey took much longer than either Arnold or Washington had expected. Bad weather and wrecked boats spoiled much of the expedition's food stores, and about 500?men of the original 1,100 turned back or died. Those who turned back, including one of the New England battalions, took many of the remaining provisions with them. The men who continued on were starving by the time they reached the first French settlements in early November.[24] On November?9, the 600?survivors of Arnold's march from Boston to Quebec arrived at Point Levis, on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence opposite Quebec City. Despite the condition of his troops, Arnold immediately began to gather boats to make a crossing. He was prepared to do so on the night of November 10, but a storm delayed him for three days. Once on the other side of the Saint Lawrence, Arnold moved his troops onto the Plains of Abraham, about 1.5?miles (2?km) from the city walls.[25]\\r\\nThe troops approaching Quebec's walls were significantly under-equipped. Arnold had no artillery, each of his men carried only five cartridges, more than 100?muskets were unserviceable, and the men's clothing had been reduced to rags. Despite being outnumbered two to one, Arnold demanded the city's surrender. Both envoys sent were shot at by British cannons, signifying that the demand had been rebuked.[26] Arnold concluded that he could not take the city by force, so he blockaded the city on its west side. On November?18, the Americans heard a (false) rumor that the British were planning to attack them with 800?men. At a council of war, they decided that the blockade could not be maintained, and Arnold began to move his men 20 miles (32?km) upriver to Pointe-aux-Trembles (\\"Aspen Point\\") to wait for Montgomery, who had just taken Montreal.[26] Henry Dearborn, who later became U.S. Secretary of War under President Thomas Jefferson was present at the battle and wrote his famous journal, The Quebec Expedition, which outlined the long and difficult march to the battle and the events that occurred there.[27]\\r\\nOn December 1, Montgomery arrived at Pointe-aux-Trembles. His force consisted of 300?men from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd New York regiments, a company of artillery raised by John Lamb,[28] about 200?men recruited by James Livingston for the 1st Canadian Regiment, and another 160?men led by Jacob Brown who were remnants of regiments disbanded due to expiring enlistments.[29][30] These were supplemented several days later by a few companies detached by Major General David Wooster, whom Montgomery had left in command at Montreal.[28] The artillery Montgomery brought included four cannons and six mortars, and he also brought winter clothing and other supplies for Arnold's men; the clothing and supplies were a prize taken when most of the British ships fleeing Montreal were captured. The commanders quickly turned towards Quebec, and put the city under siege on December 6.[29] Montgomery sent a personal letter to Carleton demanding the city's surrender, employing a woman as the messenger. Carleton declined the request and burned the letter unread. Montgomery tried again ten days later, with the same result.[29] The besiegers continued to send messages, primarily intended for the populace in the city, describing the situation there as hopeless, and suggesting that conditions would improve if they rose to assist the Americans.[31]\\r\\nOn December 10, the Americans set up their largest battery of artillery 700 yards (640?m) from the walls. The frozen ground prevented the Americans from entrenching the artillery, so they fashioned a wall out of snow blocks.[29] This battery was used to fire on the city, but the damage it did was of little consequence. Montgomery realized he was in a very difficult position, because the frozen ground prevented the digging of trenches, and his lack of heavy weapons made it impossible to breach the city's defenses. The enlistments of Arnold's men were expiring at the end of the year, and no ammunition was on the way from the colonies. Furthermore, it was very likely that British reinforcements would arrive in the spring, meaning he would either have to act or withdraw. Montgomery believed his only chance to take the city was during a snowstorm at night, when his men could scale the walls undetected.[32]\\r\\nWhile Montgomery planned the attack on the city, Christophe Plissier, a Frenchman living near Trois-Rivires, came to see him. Plissier was a political supporter of the American cause who operated the St. Maurice Ironworks.[33] He and Montgomery discussed the idea of holding a provincial convention to elect representatives to Congress. Plissier recommended against this until after Quebec City had been taken, as the habitants would not feel free to act in that way until their security was better assured.[34] The two agreed that Plissier's ironworks would provide munitions (ammunition, cannonballs, and the like) for the siege. This Plissier did until the Americans retreated in May 1776, at which time he also fled, eventually returning to France.[35]\\r\\nA snowstorm arrived on the night of December 27, prompting Montgomery to prepare the troops for the attack. However, the storm subsided, and Montgomery called off the assault. That night, a sergeant from Rhode Island deserted, carrying the plan of attack to the British. Montgomery consequently drafted a new plan; this one called for two feints against Quebec's western walls, to be led by Jacob Brown and James Livingston,[36] while two attacks would be mounted against the lower town.[32] Arnold would lead one attack to smash through the defenses at the north end of the lower town, and Montgomery would follow along the Saint Lawrence south of the town. The two forces would meet in the lower town and then launch a combined assault on the upper town by scaling its walls. The new plan was revealed only to the senior officers.[21]\\r\\nA storm broke out on December 30, and Montgomery once again gave orders for the attack. Brown and Livingston led their militia companies to their assigned positions that night: Brown by the Cape Diamond bastion, and Livingston outside St. John's Gate. When Brown reached his position between 4 am and 5 am, he fired flares to signal the other forces, and his men and Livingston's began to fire on their respective targets.[37] Montgomery and Arnold, seeing the flares, set off for the lower town.[21]\\r\\nMontgomery led his men down the steep, snow-heaped path towards the outer defenses. The storm had turned into a blizzard, making the advance a struggle. Montgomery's men eventually arrived at the palisade of the outer defenses, where an advance party of carpenters sawed their way though the wall. Montgomery himself helped saw through the second palisade, and led 50?men down a street towards a two-story building. The building formed part of the city's defenses, and was in fact a blockhouse occupied by 15?Quebec militia armed with muskets and cannons. The defenders opened fire at close range, and Montgomery was killed instantly, shot through the head by a burst of grapeshot. The few men of the advance party who survived fled back towards the palisade; only Aaron Burr and a few others escaped unhurt.[38] Many of Montgomery's officers were injured in the attack; one of the few remaining uninjured officers led the survivors back to the Plains of Abraham, leaving Montgomery's body behind.[39]\\r\\nWhile Montgomery was making his advance, Arnold advanced with his main body towards the barricades of the Sault-au-Matelot at the northern end of the lower town.[40] They passed the outer gates and some British gun batteries undetected. However, as the advance party moved around the Palace Gate, heavy fire broke out from the city walls above them.[41] The height of the walls made it impossible to return the defenders' fire, therefore Arnold ordered his men to run forward. They advanced down a narrow street, where they once again came under fire as they approached a barricade. As he was organizing his men in an attempt to take the barricade, Arnold received a deep wound in the leg from a musket ball that apparently ricocheted,[42] and was carried to the rear after transferring command of his detachment to Daniel Morgan.[43] Under Morgan's command, they captured the barricade, but had difficulty advancing further because of the narrow twisting streets and damp gunpowder, which prevented their muskets from firing. Morgan and his men holed up in some buildings to dry out their powder and rearm, but they eventually came under increasing fire; Carleton had realized the attacks on the northern gates were feints and began concentrating his forces in the lower town. A British force of 500?sallied from the Palace Gate and reoccupied the first barricade, trapping Morgan and his men in the city.[44] With no avenue of retreat and under heavy fire, Morgan and his men surrendered. The battle was over by 10?am.[45]\\r\\nThis was the first defeat suffered by the Continental Army. Carleton reported 30?Americans killed and 431?taken prisoner, including about two-thirds of Arnold's force. He also wrote that \\"many perished on the River\\" attempting to get away.[4] Allan Maclean reported that 20?bodies were recovered in the spring thaw the following May. Arnold reported about 400?missing or captured, and his official report to Congress claimed 60?killed and 300?captured.[4] British casualties were comparatively light. Carleton's initial report to General William Howe mentioned only five killed or wounded, but other witness reports ranged as high as 50.[46] Carleton's official report listed five killed and 14?wounded.[5]\\r\\nGeneral Montgomery's body was recovered by the British on New Year's Day 1776 and was given a simple military funeral on January?4, paid for by Lieutenant Governor Cramah. The body was returned to New York in 1818.[47]\\r\\nArnold refused to retreat; despite being outnumbered three to one, the sub-freezing temperature of the winter and the mass departure of his men after their enlistments expired, he laid siege to Quebec. The siege had relatively little effect on the city, which Carleton claimed had enough supplies stockpiled to last until May.[48] Immediately after the battle, Arnold sent Moses Hazen and Edward Antill to Montreal, where they informed General Wooster of the defeat. They then travelled on to Philadelphia to report the defeat to Congress and request support. (Both Hazen and Antill, English-speakers originally from the Thirteen Colonies who had settled in Quebec, went on to serve in the Continental Army for the rest of the war.)[49] In response to their report, Congress ordered reinforcements to be raised and sent north. During the winter months, small companies of men from hastily recruited regiments in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut made their way north to supplement the Continental garrisons at Quebec and Montreal.[50] The presence of disease in the camp outside Quebec, especially smallpox, took a significant toll on the besiegers, as did a general lack of provisions.[51] Smallpox ravaged Montgomery and Arnold's forces largely due to exposure to infected civilians released from Quebec. Governor Carleton condoned this practice, realizing it would severely weaken the American siege effort.[52] In early April, Arnold was replaced by General Wooster, who was himself replaced in late April by General John Thomas.[53]\\r\\nGovernor Carleton, despite appearing to have a significant advantage in manpower, chose not to attack the American camp, and remained within Quebec's walls. Montgomery, in analysing the situation before the battle, had observed that Carleton served under James Wolfe during the 1759 Siege of Quebec, and knew that the French General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm had paid a heavy price for leaving the city's defenses, ultimately losing the city and his life in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. British General James Murray had also lost a battle outside the city in 1760; Montgomery judged that Carleton was unlikely to repeat their mistakes.[54] On March 14, Jean-Baptiste Chasseur, a miller from the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence, reached Quebec City and informed Carleton there were 200?men on the south side of the river ready to act against the Americans.[55] These men and more were mobilized to make an attack on an American gun battery at Point Levis, but an advance guard of this Loyalist militia was defeated in the March 1776 Battle of Saint-Pierre by a detachment of pro-American local militia.[56]\\r\\nWhen General Thomas arrived, the conditions in the camp led him to conclude that the siege was impossible to maintain, and he began preparing to retreat. The arrival on May 6 of a small British fleet carrying 200?regulars (the vanguard of a much larger invasion force), accelerated the American preparations to depart. The retreat was turned into a near rout when Carleton marched these fresh forces, along with most of his existing garrison, out of the city to face the disorganized Americans.[57] The American forces, ravaged by smallpox (which claimed General Thomas during the retreat), eventually retreated all the way back to Fort Ticonderoga.[58] Carleton then launched a counteroffensive to regain the forts on Lake Champlain. Although he defeated the American fleet in the Battle of Valcour Island and regained control of the lake, the rear guard defense managed by Benedict Arnold prevented further action to capture Ticonderoga or Crown Point in 1776.[59]\\r\\nOn May 22, even before the Americans had been completely driven from the province, Carleton ordered a survey to identify the Canadians who had helped the American expedition in and around Quebec City. Fran?ois Baby, Gabriel-Elzar Taschereau, and Jenkin Williams travelled the province and counted the Canadians who actively provided such help; they determined that 757?had done so.[49] Carleton was somewhat lenient with minor offenders, and even freed a number of more serious offenders on the promise of good behaviour; however, once the Americans had been driven from the province, measures against supporters of the American cause became harsher, with forced labour to repair American destruction of infrastructure during the army's retreat being a frequent punishment.[60] These measures had the effect of minimizing the public expression of support for the Americans for the rest of the war.[61]\\r\\nBetween May 6 and June 1, 1776, nearly 40?British ships arrived at Quebec City.[62] They carried more than 9,000?soldiers under the command of General John Burgoyne, including about 4,000?German soldiers; so-called Hessians from Brunswick and Hanau under the command of Baron Friedrich Adolf Riedesel.[63] These forces, some of which having participated in Carleton's counteroffensive, spent the winter of 1776ÿ77 in the province, putting a significant strain on the population, which numbered only about 80,000.[64] Many of these troops were deployed in 1777 for Burgoyne's campaign for the Hudson Valley.[65]\\r\\nThree current United States Army National Guard units (Company A of the 69th Infantry Regiment,[66] the 181st Infantry Regiment,[67] and the 182nd Infantry[68]) trace their lineage to American units that participated in the Battle of Quebec.\\r\\n Media related to Battle of Quebec (1775) at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What was important about the fall of quebec?"},{"output":"over 15 million combined subscribers","context":"The Eh Bee Family are Canadian internet personalities best known for their Vine, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook channels, which have over 15 million combined subscribers and well over two billion total views.[1] They create skits and parodies to entertain a family-centered audience.

One theory refers to Mark Pringle, who filed a US Patent 2,286,644 titled \\"Method and Apparatus for Processing Potatoes\\" on 5 March 1937.[12] Pringle's work was cited by P&G in filing their own patent for improving the taste of dehydrated processed potatoes.[5] Another theory suggested two Procter advertising employees lived on Pringle Drive in Finneytown (north of Cincinnati, Ohio), and the name paired well with potato.[5][13] Another theory says that P&G chose the Pringles name from a Cincinnati telephone book.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were originally known as \\"Pringles Newfangled Potato Chips\\", but other snack manufacturers objected, saying Pringles failed to meet the definition of a potato \\"chip\\". The US Food and Drug Administration weighed in on the matter, and in 1975, they ruled Pringles could only use the word \\"chip\\" in their product name within the following phrase: \\"potato chips made from dried potatoes\\".[15] Faced with such an unpalatable appellation, Pringles eventually opted to rename their product potato \\"crisps\\" instead of chips. This later led to other issues in the United Kingdom, where the term potato \\"crisps\\" refers to the product Americans call potato \\"chips\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2008 in the London High Court, P&G lawyers successfully argued that Pringles were not crisps (even though labelled \\"Potato Crisps\\" on the container) as the potato content was only 42% and their shape, P&G stated, \\"is not found in nature\\". This ruling, against a United Kingdom VAT and Duties Tribunal decision to the contrary, exempted Pringles from the then 17.5% VAT for potato crisps and potato-derived snacks.[16] In May 2009, the Court of Appeal reversed the earlier decision. A spokesman for P&G stated it had been paying the VAT proactively and owed no back taxes.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2011, P&G agreed to the $2.35?billion sale of the brand to Diamond Foods of California, a deal which would have more than tripled the size of Diamond's snack business.[19] However, the deal fell through in February 2012 after a year-long delay due to issues over Diamond's accounts. On 31 May 2012, The Kellogg Company officially acquired Pringles for $2.695?billion as part of a plan to grow its international snacks business.[20] The acquisition of Pringles makes Kellogg the second-largest snack company in the world.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2015, there are 5 Pringles factories worldwide: in Jackson, Tennessee; Mechelen, Belgium; Johor, Malaysia; Kutno, Poland;[21] and Fujian, China.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nPringles have about 42% potato content, the remainder being wheat starch and flours (potato, corn, and rice) combined with vegetable oils, an emulsifier, salt, and seasoning.[16] Other ingredients can include sweeteners like maltodextrin and dextrose, monosodium glutamate (MSG), disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, sodium caseinate, modified food starch, monoglyceride and diglyceride, autolyzed yeast extract, natural and artificial flavors, malted barley flour, wheat bran, dried black beans, sour cream, cheddar cheese, etc.; Pringles varieties vary in their ingredients.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nPringles also produces several \\"tortilla\\" and \\"multi-grain\\" varieties which have some of their base starch ingredients replaced with corn flour, rice, wheat bran, black beans,[24] and barley flour.[25] At one point in the early 1990s, \\"Corn Pringles\\" were available. The canister was black and had cartoon images of corn, as well as the normal packaging standards. The crisps were made of corn and resembled a corn chip in flavor and texture. Rice Pringles were also available in the UK although it had been discontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\nPringles come in many flavors. Standard flavors in the US include original, salt and vinegar, sour cream and onion, cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, barbecue, hot and spicy, and loaded baked potato. Some flavors are distributed only to limited market areas. For example, prawn cocktail, wasabi, and curry flavors have been available in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally, P&G produced limited edition runs. Seasonal flavors, past and present, include ketchup, zesty lime and chili, chili cheese dog, \\"pizzalicious\\", paprika, Texas BBQ sauce, buffalo wing, and cajun. A \\"low-fat\\" variety was also sold. Examples of limited edition flavors include jalape?o, honey mustard, cheesy fries, onion blossom, mozzarella cheese stick, screamin' dill pickle, and Mexican-layered dip. In 2012, they brought out seasonal flavors of \\"peppermint white chocolate\\", cinnamon sugar, and \\"pumpkin pie spice\\".[27] Other examples of limited runs only in certain parts of the world include as mozzarella stick with marinara in North America and jalape?o in Latin America,[2] also soft-shelled crab, grilled shrimp, seaweed, \\"blueberry and hazelnut\\", and \\"lemon and sesame\\" in Asia in early 2010s. The grilled shrimp chips are pink in color, while seaweed is colored green.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo limited-market flavors, cheeseburger and \\"Taco Night\\", were recalled in March 2010 as a safety precaution after Salmonella was found in a Basic Food Flavors plant which produces the flavor-enhancing hydrolyzed vegetable protein used in those flavors.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nPringles is advertised in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland with the slogan \\"Once you pop, the fun don't stop\\"[31] along with the original slogan \\"Once you pop, you can't stop\\".[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Pringles television commercials were written, produced and directed by Thomas Scott Cadden (composer of the original Mr. Clean jingle) in 1968, while working at Tatham-Laird and Kudner Advertising Agency in Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout its history, Pringles used its advertising campaigns to compare their products to conventional potato chips. In its early years, they were marketed as \\"Newfangled Potato Chips\\" and had a small silver pop-top to open the can. Unlike the current advertising, they only mentioned that, with their pop-top cans (which have been replaced with foil tops since the 1980s), their chips remain fresh and unbroken, the can holds as many chips as a bag, and their curvy shape allows them to be stackable; thus inspiring the slogan, \\"Other potato chips just don't stack up.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1980s, the company launched the \\"Pringle Jingle\\", whose lyrics were \\"Once you taste the flavor (\\"It's a deep-fried taste!\\"), then you get the fever (\\"With a crispy crunch!\\"), then you've got the fever for the flavor of a Pringle!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in the 1990s and continuing today, Pringles has advertised their products by comparing them to bagged chips, which they view as greasy and broken. In each ad, a group of people are enjoying Pringles, while a lone person is enjoying a bag of generic potato chips (the bags themselves resemble either Lay's or Ruffles, depending on the Pringles variety marketed in the ad). They dump out some broken chips into their hand, only to find they are greasy, and end up wiping the grease all over their clothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pringles logo is a stylized cartoon caricature of the head of a male figure (officially known as \\"Julius Pringles\\"[33]) designed by Louis R. Dixon, with a large mustache and parted bangs (until 2001, the character had eyebrows and his bow tie framed the product name; in 1998, the bangs and lips were removed from the logo, and his head was widened a little).\\r\\n\\r\\nPringles, as a product brand, is especially known for its packaging, a tubular paperboard can with a foil-lined interior and a resealable plastic lid, which was invented by Fredric J. Baur. Baur (1918-2008) was an organic chemist and food storage technician who specialized in research and development and quality control for Cincinnati-based P&G. Baur's children honored his request to bury him in one of the cans by placing part of his cremated remains in a Pringles container in his grave.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe can has been criticised for being difficult to recycle due to the multiple materials used in its construction.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, Lucasfilm and Pringles jointly commissioned crowdsourcing video studio Tongal for a commercial,[36] with a total of $75,000 in prize money distributed to seven finalists.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nA promotion for the upcoming game Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 lasting from September 17 to December 31, 2018 includes 4 Pringles Mega Stack products awarding buyers \\"Double XP\\" for the upcoming game.[38]","input":"What manufacturer introduced pringles potato chips in 1969?"},{"output":"at the confluence of the Sengge Zangbo and Gar Tsangpo rivers that drain the Nganglong Kangri and Gangdise Shan (Gang Rinpoche, Mt. Kailas) mountain ranges","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indus River (locally called Sindh) is one of the longest rivers in Asia. Originating in the Tibetan Plateau in the vicinity of Lake Manasarovar, the river runs a course through the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, towards Gilgit-Baltistan and the Hindukush ranges, and then flows in a southerly direction along the entire length of Pakistan to merge into the Arabian Sea near the port city of Karachi in Sindh.[1][2] It is the longest river and national river of Pakistan.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe river has a total drainage area exceeding 1,165,000?km2 (450,000?sq?mi). Its estimated annual flow stands at around 243?km3 (58?cu?mi), twice that of the Nile River and three times that of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers combined, making it the twenty-first largest river in the world in terms of annual flow.[4] The Zanskar is its left bank tributary in Ladakh. In the plains, its left bank tributary is the Panjnad which itself has five major tributaries, namely, the Chenab, Jhelum, the Ravi, the Beas, and the Sutlej. Its principal right bank tributaries are the Shyok, the Gilgit, the Kabul, the Gomal, and the Kurram. Beginning in a mountain spring and fed with glaciers and rivers in the Himalayas, the river supports ecosystems of temperate forests, plains and arid countryside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe northern part of the Indus Valley, with its tributaries, forms the Punjab region, while the lower course of the Indus is known as Sindh and ends in a large delta. The river has historically been important to many cultures of the region. The 3rd millennium BC saw the rise of a major urban civilization of the Bronze Age. During the 2nd millennium BC, the Punjab region was mentioned in the hymns of the Hindu Rigveda as Sapta Sindhu and the Zoroastrian Avesta as Hapta Hindu (both terms meaning \\"seven rivers\\"). Early historical kingdoms that arose in the Indus Valley include Gandhra, and the Ror dynasty of Sauvؐra. The Indus River came into the knowledge of the West early in the Classical Period, when King Darius of Persia sent his Greek subject Scylax of Caryanda to explore the river, ca. 515?BC.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis river was known to the ancient Indians in Sanskrit as Sindhu and the Old Iranians as Hindu, which was regarded by both of them as \\"the border river\\".[5][6][7][8][9] The variation between the two names is explained by the Old Iranian sound change *s > h, which occurred between 850ÿ600 BCE according to Asko Parpola.[10][11] From Iran, the name passed to the Greeks as Hind܇s (?Ѵ??), which later turned into Ind܇s, with a loss of the initial aspirant.[12] It was adopted by the Romans as Indus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meaning of Sindhu as a \\"large body of water, sea, or ocean\\" is a later meaning in Classical Sanskrit.[13] A later Persian name for the river was Darya,[14] which similarly has the connotations of large body of water and sea.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther variants of the name Sindhu include Assyrian Sinda (as early as the 7th century BC), Persian  Ab-e-sind,  Pashto  Abasind, Arab Al-Sind,  Chinese Sintow, and Javanese  Santri.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia is a Greek and Latin term for \\"the country of the River Indus\\". The region through which the river drains into sea is called Sindh and owes its name to the river (Sanskrit Sindhu).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMegasthenes' book Indica derives its name from the river's Greek name, \\"Ind܇s\\" (?Ѵ??), and describes Nearchus's contemporaneous account of how Alexander the Great crossed the river. The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians (people of present-day northwest India and Pakistan) as \\"Ind܇i\\" (?Ѵ?), literally meaning \\"the people of the Indus\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nRigveda also describes several mythical rivers, including one named \\"Sindhu\\". The Rigvedic \\"Sindhu\\" is thought to be the present-day Indus river and is attested 176 times in its text ÿ 95 times in the plural, more often used in the generic meaning. In the Rigveda, notably in the later hymns, the meaning of the word is narrowed to refer to the Indus river in particular, as in the list of rivers mentioned in the hymn of Nadistuti sukta. The Rigvedic hymns apply a feminine gender to all the rivers mentioned therein but \\"Sindhu\\" is the only river attributed the masculine gender which means Sindhu is the warrior and greatest among all other rivers in whole world.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other languages of the region, the river is known as ?????? (Sindhu) in Hindi and Nepali, ???? (Sindhu) in Sindhi, ????? (Sindh) in Shahmukhi Punjabi, ???? ??? (Sindh Nadؐ) in Gurmukhؐ Punjabi, ?????? (Absin lit. \\"Father of Rivers\\") in Pashto, ??? ????? (Nahar al-Sind) in Arabic, ?????????????? (seng ge gtsang po lit. \\"Lion River\\" or Lion Spring) in Tibetan, CH (Ynd) in Chinese, and Nilab in Turki.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indus River provides key water resources for Pakistan's economy ÿ especially the breadbasket of Punjab province, which accounts for most of the nation's agricultural production, and Sindh. The word Punjab means \\"land of five rivers\\" and the five rivers are Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, all of which finally flow into the Indus. The Indus also supports many heavy industries and provides the main supply of potable water in Pakistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ultimate source of the Indus is in Tibet; the river begins at the confluence of the Sengge Zangbo and Gar Tsangpo rivers that drain the Nganglong Kangri and Gangdise Shan (Gang Rinpoche, Mt. Kailas) mountain ranges. The Indus then flows northwest through Ladakh and Baltistan into Gilgit, just south of the Karakoram range. The Shyok, Shigar and Gilgit rivers carry glacial waters into the main river. It gradually bends to the south, coming out of the hills between Peshawar and Rawalpindi. The Indus passes gigantic gorges 4,500ÿ5,200 metres (15,000ÿ17,000 feet) deep near the Nanga Parbat massif. It flows swiftly across Hazara and is dammed at the Tarbela Reservoir. The Kabul River joins it near Attock. The remainder of its route to the sea is in the plains of the Punjab[17] and Sindh, where the flow of the river becomes slow and highly braided. It is joined by the Panjnad at Mithankot. Beyond this confluence, the river, at one time, was named the Satnad River (sat = \\"seven\\", nadؐ = \\"river\\"), as the river now carried the waters of the Kabul River, the Indus River and the five Punjab rivers. Passing by Jamshoro, it ends in a large delta to the east of Thatta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indus is one of the few rivers in the world to exhibit a tidal bore. The Indus system is largely fed by the snows and glaciers of the Himalayas, Karakoram and the Hindu Kush ranges of Tibet, the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh and Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. The flow of the river is also determined by the seasons ÿ it diminishes greatly in the winter, while flooding its banks in the monsoon months from July to September. There is also evidence of a steady shift in the course of the river since prehistoric times ÿ it deviated westwards from flowing into the Rann of Kutch and adjoining Banni grasslands after the 1816 earthquake.[18][19] Presently, Indus water flows in to the Rann of Kutch during its floods breaching flood banks.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional source of the river is the Senge Khabab or \\"Lion's Mouth\\", a perennial spring, not far from the sacred Mount Kailash marked by a long low line of Tibetan chortens. There are several other tributaries nearby, which may possibly form a longer stream than Senge Khabab, but unlike the Senge Khabab, are all dependent on snowmelt. The Zanskar River, which flows into the Indus in Ladakh, has a greater volume of water than the Indus itself before that point.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation, such as Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, date back to around 3300?BC, and represent some of the largest human habitations of the ancient world. The Indus Valley Civilisation extended from across northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India,[22] with an upward reach from east of Jhelum River to Ropar on the upper Sutlej. The coastal settlements extended from Sutkagan Dor at the Pakistan, Iran border to Kutch in modern Gujarat, India. There is an Indus site on the Amu Darya at Shortughai in northern Afghanistan, and the Indus site Alamgirpur at the Hindon River is located only 28?km (17?mi) from Delhi. To date, over 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Ghaggar-Hakra River and its tributaries. Among the settlements were the major urban centres of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, as well as Lothal, Dholavira, Ganeriwala, and Rakhigarhi. Only 90ÿ96 of more than 800 known Indus Valley sites have been discovered on the Indus and its tributaries.[citation needed] The Sutlej, now a tributary of the Indus, in Harappan times flowed into the Ghaggar-Hakra River, in the watershed of which were more Harappan sites than along the Indus.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost scholars believe that settlements of Gandhara grave culture of the early Indo-Aryans flourished in Gandhara from 1700?BC to 600?BC, when Mohenjo-daro and Harappa had already been abandoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"India\\" is derived from the Indus River. In ancient times, \\"India\\" initially referred to those regions immediately along the east bank of the Indus, but by 300?BC, Greek writers including Herodotus and Megasthenes were applying the term to the entire subcontinent that extends much farther eastward.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lower basin of the Indus forms a natural boundary between the Iranian Plateau and the Indian subcontinent; this region embraces all or parts of the Pakistani provinces Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh and the countries Afghanistan and India. It was crossed by the invading armies of Alexander, but after his Macedonians conquered the west bankjoining it to the Hellenic Empire, they elected to retreat along the southern course of the river, ending Alexander's Asian campaign. The Indus plains were later dominated by the Persian empire and then the Kushan empire. Over several centuries Muslim armies of Muhammad bin Qasim, Mahmud of Ghazni, Mohammed Ghori, Tamerlane and Babur crossed the river to invade the inner regions of the Punjab and points farther south and east\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indus river feeds the Indus submarine fan, which is the second largest sediment body on the Earth.[25] It consists of around 5?million cubic kilometres of material eroded from the mountains. Studies of the sediment in the modern river indicate that the Karakoram Mountains in northern Pakistan and India are the single most important source of material, with the Himalayas providing the next largest contribution, mostly via the large rivers of the Punjab (Jhelum, Ravi, Chenab, Beas and Sutlej). Analysis of sediments from the Arabian Sea has demonstrated that prior to five million years ago the Indus was not connected to these Punjab rivers which instead flowed east into the Ganga and were captured after that time.[26] Earlier work showed that sand and silt from western Tibet was reaching the Arabian Sea by 45?million years ago, implying the existence of an ancient Indus River by that time.[27] The delta of this proto-Indus river has subsequently been found in the Katawaz Basin, on the Afghan-Pakistan border.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Nanga Parbat region, the massive amounts of erosion due to the Indus river following the capture and rerouting through that area is thought to bring middle and lower crustal rocks to the surface.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2011, satellite images showed that the Indus river had re-entered India, feeding Great Rann of Kutch, Little Rann of Kutch and a lake near Ahmedabad known as Nal Sarovar.[20] Heavy rains had left the river basin along with the Lake Manchar, Lake Hemal and Kalri Lake (all in modern-day Pakistan) inundated. This happened two centuries after the Indus river shifted its course westwards following the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Induan Age at start of the Triassic Period of geological time is named for the Indus region.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccounts of the Indus valley from the times of Alexander's campaign indicate a healthy forest cover in the region, which has now considerably receded. The Mughal Emperor Babur writes of encountering rhinoceroses along its bank in his memoirs (the Baburnama). Extensive deforestation and human interference in the ecology of the Shivalik Hills has led to a marked deterioration in vegetation and growing conditions. The Indus valley regions are arid with poor vegetation. Agriculture is sustained largely due to irrigation works.\\r\\nThe Indus river and its watershed has a rich biodiversity. It is home to around 25 amphibian species and 147 fish species, 22 of which are only found in the Indus.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indus River Dolphin (Platanista indicus minor) is a sub-species of dolphin found only in the Indus River. It formerly also occurred in the tributaries of the Indus river. According to the World Wildlife Fund it is one of the most threatened cetaceans with only about 1,000 still existing.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nPalla fish Tenualosa ilisha of the river is a delicacy for people living along the river. The population of fish in the river is moderately high, with Sukkur, Thatta and Kotri being the major fishing centres ÿ all in the lower Sindh course. But damming and irrigation has made fish farming an important economic activity. Located southeast of Karachi, the large delta has been recognised by conservationists as one of the world's most important ecological regions. Here the river turns into many marshes, streams and creeks and meets the sea at shallow levels. Here marine fishes are found in abundance, including pomfret and prawns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indus is the most important supplier of water resources to the Punjab and Sindh plains ÿ it forms the backbone of agriculture and food production in Pakistan. The river is especially critical since rainfall is meagre in the lower Indus valley. Irrigation canals were first built by the people of the Indus Valley Civilisation, and later by the engineers of the Kushan Empire and the Mughal Empire. Modern irrigation was introduced by the British East India Company in 1850 ÿ the construction of modern canals accompanied with the restoration of old canals. The British supervised the construction of one of the most complex irrigation networks in the world. The Guddu Barrage is 1,350?m (4,430?ft) long ÿ irrigating Sukkur, Jacobabad, Larkana and Kalat. The Sukkur Barrage serves over 20,000?km2 (7,700?sq?mi).\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Pakistan came into existence, a water control treaty signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 guaranteed that Pakistan would receive water from the Indus River and its two tributaries the Jhelum River & the Chenab River independently of upstream control by India.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indus Basin Project consisted primarily of the construction of two main dams, the Mangla Dam built on the Jhelum River and the Tarbela Dam constructed on the Indus River, together with their subsidiary dams.[32] The Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority undertook the construction of the Chashma-Jhelum link canal ÿ linking the waters of the Indus and Jhelum rivers ÿ extending water supplies to the regions of Bahawalpur and Multan. Pakistan constructed the Tarbela Dam near Rawalpindi ÿ standing 2,743 metres (9,000?ft) long and 143 metres (470?ft) high, with an 80-kilometre (50?mi) long reservoir. It supports the Chashma Barrage near Dera Ismail Khan for irrigation use and flood control and the Taunsa Barrage near Dera Ghazi Khan which also produces 100,000?kilowatts of electricity. The Kotri Barrage near Hyderabad is 915 metres (3,000?ft) long and provides additional water supplies for Karachi. The extensive linking of tributaries with the Indus has helped spread water resources to the valley of Peshawar, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The extensive irrigation and dam projects provide the basis for Pakistan's large production of crops such as cotton, sugarcane and wheat. The dams also generate electricity for heavy industries and urban centers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inhabitants of the regions are mainly Muslim as Pakistan is an Islamic country through which the Indus river passes and forms a major natural feature and resource are diverse in ethnicity, religion, national and linguistic backgrounds. On the northern course of the river in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in India, live the Buddhist people of Ladakh, of Tibetan stock, and the Dards of Indo-Aryan or Dardic stock and practising Islam. Then it descends into Baltistan, northern Pakistan passing the main Balti city of Skardu. A river from Dubair Bala also drains into it at Dubair Bazar. People living in this area are mainly Kohistani and speak the Kohistani language. Major areas through which the Indus river passes in Kohistan are Dasu, Pattan and Dubair. As it continues through Pakistan, the Indus river forms a distinctive boundary of ethnicity and cultures ÿ upon the western banks the population is largely Pashtun, Baloch, and of other Iranian stock. The eastern banks are largely populated by people of Indo-Aryan stock, such as the Punjabis and the Sindhis. In northern Punjab and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, ethnic Pashtun tribes live alongside Dardic people in the hills (Khowar, Kalash, Shina, etc.), Burushos (in Hunza), and Punjabi people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people living along the Indus river speak Punjabi and Sindhi on the eastern side (in Punjab and Sindh provinces respectively), Pushto plus Balochi as well as Barohi (in Khyber Pakhtoonkha and Baluchistan provinces). In the province of Sindh, the upper third of the river is inhabited by people speaking Saraiki; which is a somewhat transitional dialect of the Punjabi and Sindhi languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indus is a strategically vital resource for Pakistan's economy and society. After Pakistan and India declared Independence from the British Raj, the use of the waters of the Indus and its five eastern tributaries became a major dispute between India and Pakistan. The irrigation canals of the Sutlej valley and the Bari Doab were split ÿ with the canals lying primarily in Pakistan and the headwork dams in India disrupting supply in some parts of Pakistan. The concern over India building large dams over various Punjab rivers that could undercut the supply flowing to Pakistan, as well as the possibility that India could divert rivers in the time of war, caused political consternation in Pakistan. Holding diplomatic talks brokered by the World Bank, India and Pakistan signed the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960. The treaty gave India control of the three easternmost rivers of the Punjab, the Sutlej, the Beas and the Ravi, while Pakistan gained control of the three western rivers, the Jhelum, the Chenab and the Indus. India retained the right to use of the western rivers for non-irrigation projects.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are concerns that extensive deforestation, industrial pollution and global warming are affecting the vegetation and wildlife of the Indus delta, while affecting agricultural production as well. There are also concerns that the Indus river may be shifting its course westwards ÿ although the progression spans centuries. On numerous occasions, sediment clogging owing to poor maintenance of canals has affected agricultural production and vegetation. In addition, extreme heat has caused water to evaporate, leaving salt deposits that render lands useless for cultivation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the delta used to receive almost all of the water from the Indus river, which has an annual flow of approximately 180?billion cubic metres (240?billion cubic yards), and is accompanied by 400 million tonnes of silt. Since the 1940s, dams, barrages and irrigation works have been constructed on the river Indus.[34] The Indus Basin Irrigation System is the \\"largest contiguous irrigation system developed over the past 140 years\\" anywhere in the world.[35] This has reduced the flow of water and by 2018, the average annual flow of water below the Kotri barrage was 32G10^9?m3 (1.1G10^12?cu?ft), and annual amount of silt discharged was estimated to be 100?million tonnes (98?million long tons).[36] Substantial annual chemical/dissolved load of 46 million tons in the river basin is unable to reach the sea as it is getting trapped in the irrigated areas by increasing the ground water salinity. Nearly 90% of the water from Indus River System has been harnessed already in Pakistan and India leaving rest of water to join the sea. Any further utilization of the river basin water is not economically feasible.[37][38]  The result has been catastrophic for both the environment and the local population. The reduction of freshwater due to the dams also increases salinity, making the surface and ground water available in the delta area unsuitable for the freshwater species and crops.[39][40] As a result, the 2010 Pakistan floods were considered \\"good news\\" for the ecosystem and population of the river delta as they brought much needed fresh water.[41][42] In case of the Indus dolphin, the damming of the river has isolated the delta dolphin population from those dolphins upstream.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tibetan Plateau contains the world's third-largest store of ice. Qin Dahe, the former head of the China Meteorological Administration, said the recent fast pace of melting and warmer temperatures will be good for agriculture and tourism in the short term, but issued a strong warning:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"There is insufficient data to say what will happen to the Indus,\\" says David Grey, the World Bank's senior water advisor in South Asia. \\"But we all have very nasty fears that the flows of the Indus could be severely, severely affected by glacier melt as a consequence of climate change,\\" and reduced by perhaps as much as 50 percent. \\"Now what does that mean to a population that lives in a desert [where], without the river, there would be no life? I don't know the answer to that question,\\" he says. \\"But we need to be concerned about that. Deeply, deeply concerned.\\"[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke said, shortly before his death in 2010, that he believed that falling water levels in the Indus River \\"could very well precipitate World War III.\\"[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years factories on the banks of the Indus River have increased levels of water pollution in the river and the atmosphere around it. High levels of pollutants in the river have led to the deaths of endangered Indus River Dolphin. The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency has ordered polluting factories around the river to shut down under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997.[46] Death of the Indus River Dolphin has also been attributed to fishermen using poison to kill fish and scooping them up.[47][48] As a result, the government banned fishing from Guddu Barrage to Sukkur.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nComing second after the Yangtze, and together with 9 other rivers, the Indus transports 90?% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans.[50][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2010, following abnormally heavy monsoon rains, the Indus River rose above its banks and started flooding. The rain continued for the next two months, devastating large areas of Pakistan. In Sindh, the Indus burst its banks near Sukkur on 8 August, submerging the village of Mor Khan Jatoi.[52] In early August, the heaviest flooding moved southward along the Indus River from severely affected northern regions toward western Punjab, where at least 1,400,000 acres (570,000?ha) of cropland was destroyed, and the southern province of Sindh.[53] As of  September 2010[update], over two thousand people had died and over a million homes had been destroyed since the flooding began.[54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2011 Sindh floods began during the Pakistani monsoon season in mid-August 2011, resulting from heavy monsoon rains in Sindh, eastern Balochistan, and southern Punjab.[56] The floods caused considerable damage; an estimated 434 civilians were killed, with 5.3?million people and 1,524,773 homes affected.[57] Sindh is a fertile region and often called the \\"breadbasket\\" of the country; the damage and toll of the floods on the local agrarian economy was said to be extensive. At least 1.7?million acres (690,000?ha; 2,700?sq?mi) of arable land were inundated. The flooding followed the previous year's floods, which devastated a large part of the country.[57] Unprecedented torrential monsoon rains caused severe flooding in 16 districts of Sindh.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Pakistan currently there are three barrages on the Indus: Guddu barrage, Sukkur Barrage, and Kotri barrage (also called Ghulam Muhammad barrage).

The most \\"extreme\\" tornado in recorded history was the Tri-State Tornado, which spread through parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925. It is considered an F5, even though tornadoes were not ranked on any scale in that era. It holds records for longest path length at 219 miles (352?km), longest duration at about 3? hours, and fastest forward speed for a significant tornado at 73?mph (117?km/h) anywhere on Earth. In addition, it is the deadliest single tornado in United States history with 695 fatalities.[1] It was also the third-costliest tornado in history at the time, but has been surpassed by several others non-normalized. When costs are normalized for wealth and inflation, it still ranks third today.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deadliest tornado in world history was the DaulatpurÿSaturia tornado in Bangladesh on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1,300 people.[3] In its history, Bangladesh has had at least 19 tornadoes kill more than 100 people, almost half of the total for the rest of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 37 years, the most extensive tornado outbreak on record, in almost every category, was the 1974 Super Outbreak, which affected a large area of the central United States and extreme southern Ontario in Canada on April 3 and April 4, 1974. Not only did this outbreak feature 148 tornadoes in only 18 hours, but an unprecedented number of them were violent; 7 were of F5 intensity and 23 were F4. During the peak of this outbreak there were 16 tornadoes on the ground at the same time. More than 300 people, possibly as many as 330, were killed by tornadoes during this outbreak. However, this record was later broken during the 2011 Super Outbreak, which resulted in 360 tornadoes and 324 tornadic fatalities.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2011 Super Outbreak was the most prolific tornado outbreak in USA history. It produced 360 tornadoes, with 216 of those in a single 24-hour period on April 27,[5] including 11 EF4 and 4 EF5 tornadoes. 348 deaths occurred in that outbreak, of which 324 were tornado related. The outbreak helped smash the record for most tornadoes in the month of April with 770 tornadoes, almost triple the prior record (267 in April 1974). The overall record for a single month was 542 in May 2003, which was also broken.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe infamous 1974 Super Outbreak of April 3ÿ4, 1974, which spawned 148 confirmed tornadoes across eastern North America, held the record for the most prolific tornado outbreak for many years. Not only did it produce an exceptional number of tornadoes, but it was also an inordinately intense outbreak producing dozens of large, long-track tornadoes, including 7 F5 and 23 F4 tornadoes. More significant tornadoes occurred within 24?hours than any other week in the tornado record.[7] Due to a secular trend in tornado reporting, the 2011 and 1974 tornado counts are not directly comparable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost tornado outbreaks in North America occur in the spring, but there is a secondary peak of tornado activity in the fall which is less consistent but can include exceptionally large and/or intense outbreaks. In 1992, an estimated 95 tornadoes broke out in a record 41?hours of continuous tornado activity from November 21 to 23. This is also among the largest-known outbreaks in areal expanse. Many other very large outbreaks have occurred in autumn, especially in October and November.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greatest number of tornadoes spawned from a hurricane is 118 from Hurricane Ivan in 2004.[8] Caution is advised comparing the raw number of counted tornadoes from recent decades to decades prior to the 1990s since more tornadoes that occur are now recorded than in the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 26, 1989 in Bangladesh a large tornado took at least 1,300 lives.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tri-State Tornado of March 18, 1925 killed 695?people in Missouri (11), Illinois (613), and Indiana (71). The outbreak it occurred with was also the deadliest known tornado outbreak, with a combined death toll of 747 across the Mississippi River Valley.[1][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar to fatalities, damage (and observations) of a tornado are a coincidence of what character of tornado interacts with certain characteristics of built up areas. That is, destructive tornadoes are in a sense \\"accidents\\" of a large tornado striking a large population. In addition to population and changes thereof, comparing damage historically is subject to changes in wealth and inflation. The 1896 St. LouisÿEast St. Louis tornado on May 27, incurred the most damages adjusted for wealth and inflation, at an estimated $2.9?billion (1997?USD). In raw numbers, the Joplin tornado of May 22, 2011 is considered the costliest tornado in recent history, with damage totals near $2.8 billion (2011 USD). Until 2011, the \\"Bridge Creek-Moore tornado\\" of May 3, 1999 was the most damaging.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the F5 1999 Bridge CreekÿMoore tornado on May 3, 1999 in the southern Oklahoma City metro area, a Doppler on Wheels situated near the tornado measured winds of 302?I?20?mph (486?I?32?km/h) momentarily in a small area inside the funnel approximately 100?m (330?ft) above ground level.[13] These are also the highest wind speeds observed on Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 31, 2013, a tornado hit rural areas near El Reno, Oklahoma. The tornado was originally rated as an EF3 based on damage; however, after mobile radar data analysis was conducted, it was concluded to have been an EF5 due to a measured wind speed of greater than 296?mph (476?km/h), second only to the Bridge Creek - Moore tornado. Revised RaXPol analysis found winds of 302?mph (486?km/h) well above ground level and 291?mph (468?km/h) below 10?m (33?ft) with some subvortices moving at 175?mph (282?km/h).[14] These winds may possibly be as high or higher than the winds recorded on May?3, 1999. Despite the recorded windspeed, the El Reno tornado was later downgraded back to EF3 due to the fact that no EF5 damage was found, likely due to the lack of sufficient damage indicators in the largely rural area west of Oklahoma City.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nWinds were measured at 268?mph (431?km/h) using portable Doppler radar in the Red Rock, Oklahoma tornado during the April 26, 1991 tornado outbreak in north-central Oklahoma. Though these winds are possibly indicative of an F5 strength tornado, this particular tornado's path never encountered any significant structures and caused minimal damage. Thus it was rated an F4.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe longest-known track for a single tornado is the Tri-State Tornado with a path length of 151 to 235?mi (243 to 378?km). For years there was debate whether the originally recognized path length of 219?mi (352?km) over 3.5 hours was from one tornado or a series. Some very long track (VLT) tornadoes were later determined to be successive tornadoes spawned by the same supercell thunderstorm, which are known as a tornado family. The Tri-State Tornado, however, appeared to have no gaps in the damage. A six-year reanalysis study by a team of severe convective storm meteorologists found insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions but does conclude that it is likely that the beginning and ending of the path was resultant of separate tornadoes comprising a tornado family. It also found that the tornado began 15?mi (24?km) to the west and ended 1?mi (1.6?km) farther east than previously known, bringing the total path to 235?mi (378?km). The 174?mi (280?km) segment from central Madison County, Missouri to Pike County, Indiana is likely one continuous tornado and the 151?mi (243?km) segment from central Bollinger County, Missouri to western Pike County, Indiana is very likely a single continuous tornado. Another significant tornado was found about 65?mi (105?km) east-northeast of the end of aforementioned segment(s) of the Tri-State Tornado Family and is likely another member of the family. Its path length of 20?mi (32?km) over about 20 minutes makes the known tornado family path length total to 320?mi (510?km) over about 5? hours.[18] Grazulis in 2001 wrote that the first 60?mi (97?km) of the (originally recognized) track is probably the result of two or more tornadoes and that a path length of 157?mi (253?km) was seemingly continuous.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat at one time was thought to be the record holder for the longest tornado path is now thought to be the longest tornado family, with a track of at least 293 miles (472?km) on May 26, 1917 from the Missouri border across Illinois into Indiana. It caused severe damage and mass casualties in Charleston and Mattoon, Illinois.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was probably the longest track supercell thunderstorm tracked 790 miles (1,270?km) across 6 states in 17.5?hours on March 12, 2006 as part of the March 2006 tornado outbreak sequence. It began in Noble County, Oklahoma and ended in Jackson County, Michigan, producing many tornadoes in Missouri and Illinois.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficially, the widest tornado on record is the El Reno, Oklahoma tornado of May 31, 2013 with a width of 2.6 miles (4.2?km) at its peak. This is the width found by the National Weather Service based on preliminary data from University of Oklahoma RaxPol mobile radar that also sampled winds of 296?mph (476?km/h) which was used to upgrade the tornado to EF5.[21] However, it was revealed that these winds did not impact any structures, and as a result the tornado was downgraded to EF3 based on damage.[22] However, another possible contender for the widest tornado as measured by radar was the F4 Mulhall tornado in north-central Oklahoma which occurred during the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak. The diameter of the maximum winds (over 110?mph (49?m/s)) was over 5,200 feet (1,600?m) as measured by a DOW radar. Although the tornado passed largely over rural terrain, the width of the wind swath capable of producing damage was as wide as 4?mi (6.4?km).[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe F4 Hallam, Nebraska tornado during the outbreak of May 22, 2004 was the previous official record holder for the widest tornado, surveyed at 2.5 miles (4.0?km) wide. A similar size tornado struck Edmonson, Texas on May 31, 1968, when a damage path width between 2 to 3 miles (3.2 to 4.8?km) was recorded from an F3 tornado.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest forward speed of a tornado on record was 73 miles per hour (117?km/h) from the 1925 Tri-State Tornado (other weak tornadoes have approached or exceeded this speed, but this is the fastest forward movement observed in a major tornado).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nA pressure deficit of 100 millibars (2.95?inHg) was observed when a violent tornado near Manchester, South Dakota on June 24, 2003 passed directly over an in-situ probe that storm chasing researcher Tim Samaras deployed.[26] In less than a minute, the pressure dropped to 850 millibars (25.10?inHg), which are the greatest pressure decline and the lowest pressure ever recorded at the Earth's surface when adjusted to sea level.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 21, 2007, a 194-millibar (5.73?inHg) pressure deficit was reported when a tornado struck a storm chasing vehicle in Tulia, Texas.[29] The tornado caused EF2 damage as it passed through Tulia. The reported pressure drop far exceeds that which would be expected based on theoretical calculations.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a questionable and unofficial citizen's barometer measurement of a 192-millibar (5.67?inHg) drop around Minneapolis in 1904.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the Greensburg EF5 tornado on May 4, 2007, it had been 8 years and one day since the US had a confirmed F5 or EF5 tornado. The last confirmed F5 or EF5 had hit southern Oklahoma City metro area and surrounding communities during the May 3, 1999 event. This is the longest interval without an F5 or EF5 tornado since official records began in 1950. \\r\\n\\r\\nMatt Suter of Fordland, Missouri holds the record for the longest-known distance traveled by anyone picked up by a tornado and survive. On March 12, 2006 he was carried 1,307 feet (398?m), 13 feet (4.0?m) shy of one-quarter mile (400?m), according to National Weather Service measurements.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe small town of Codell, Kansas, was hit by a tornado on the same date (May 20) three consecutive years: 1916, 1917, and 1918.[39][40] The United States has about 100,000 thunderstorms per year; less than 1% produce a tornado. The odds of this coincidence occurring again are extremely small.\\r\\n\\r\\nTanner, a small town in northern Alabama, was hit by an F5 tornado on April 3, 1974 and was struck again 45 minutes later by a second F5 (however, the rating is disputed and it may have been high-end F4), demolishing what remained of the town. Thirty-seven years later, on April 27, 2011 (the largest and deadliest outbreak since 1974), Tanner was hit yet again by the EF5 2011 HackleburgÿPhil Campbell, Alabama tornado, which produced high-end EF4 damage in the southern portion of town. The suburban community of Harvest, Alabama, just to the northeast, also sustained major impacts from all three Tanner tornadoes, and was also hit by destructive tornadoes in 1995 and 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe south Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, Oklahoma was hit by strong to violent tornadoes in 1973, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2010, 2013, and 2015, five of which were of F4/EF4 strength or greater. The 1999 and 2013 events were rated F5 and EF5, respectively. In total, about 23 tornadoes have struck within the immediate vicinity of Moore since 1890, the most recent of which was an EF2 on March 25, 2015.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city of Jackson, Tennessee has been hit by an F4/EF4 tornado three separate times, in 1999, 2003, and 2008. All three of these tornadoes occurred after dark and were preceded or followed by a separate F3/EF3 tornado that caused additional destruction in the Jackson area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Island, Nebraska area was hit by seven tornadoes in 4 hours.","input":"What is the deadliest tornado on record in the united states?"},{"output":"bootleg recording of a film recorded in a movie theater, often (although not always) filmed using a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth","context":"A telesync (TS)[1] is a bootleg recording of a film recorded in a movie theater, often (although not always) filmed using a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth.

Standing 4,207?m (13,802?ft) above sea level, its peak is the highest point in the state of Hawaii making the island of Hawaii the second highest island in the world. Most of the mountain is underwater; when measured from its oceanic base, Mauna Kea is over 10,000?m (33,000?ft) tall and is the tallest mountain on Earth.[5] Mauna Kea is about a million years old, and has thus passed the most active shield stage of life hundreds of thousands of years ago. In its current post-shield state, its lava is more viscous, resulting in a steeper profile. Late volcanism has also given it a much rougher appearance than its neighboring volcanoes; contributing factors include the construction of cinder cones, the decentralization of its rift zones, the glaciation on its peak, and the weathering effects of the prevailing trade winds. Mauna Kea last erupted 6,000 to 4,000 years ago and is now considered dormant.\\r\\nIn Hawaiian mythology, the peaks of the island of Hawaii are sacred. An ancient law allowed only high-ranking ali?i to visit its peak. Ancient Hawaiians living on the slopes of Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep and game animals, many of which became feral and began to damage the mountain's ecological balance. Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a Sophora chrysophyllaÿMyoporum sandwicense (or mmaneÿnaio) forest on its flanks, and an Acacia koaÿMetrosideros polymorpha (or koaÿ?hi?a) forest, now mostly cleared by the former sugar industry, at its base. In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources to eradicate all feral species on the mountain.\\r\\nWith its high elevation, dry environment, and stable airflow, Mauna Kea's summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation. Since the creation of an access road in 1964, thirteen telescopes funded by eleven countries have been constructed at the summit. The Mauna Kea Observatories are used for scientific research across the electromagnetic spectrum and comprise the largest such facility in the world. Their construction on a landscape considered sacred by Native Hawaiians continues to be a topic of debate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMauna Kea is one of five volcanoes that form the island of Hawaii, the largest and youngest island of the HawaiianÿEmperor seamount chain.[6] Of these five hotspot volcanoes, Mauna Kea is the fourth oldest and fourth most active.[3] It began as a preshield volcano driven by the Hawaii hotspot around one million years ago, and became exceptionally active during its shield stage until 500,000 years ago.[7] Mauna Kea entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000?years ago,[8] and is currently dormant.[3] Mauna Kea does not have a visible summit caldera, but contains a number of small cinder and pumice cones near its summit. A former summit caldera may have been filled and buried by later summit eruption deposits.\\r\\nMauna Kea is over 3,200?km3 (770?cu?mi) in volume, so massive that it and its neighbor, Mauna Loa, depress the ocean crust beneath it by 6?km (4?mi).[9] The volcano continues to slip and flatten under its own weight at a rate of less than 0.2?mm (0.01?in) per year. Much of its mass lies east of its present summit. Mauna Kea stands 4,205?m (13,800?ft) above sea level, just 35?m (110?ft) higher than its neighbor Mauna Loa,[3] and is the highest point in the state of Hawaii.[10] Measured from its base on the ocean floor, it rises over 10,000?m (33,000?ft), significantly greater than the elevation of Mount Everest above sea level.[11][12]\\r\\nLike all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea has been created as the Pacific tectonic plate has moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's underlying mantle.[13] The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the 6,000?km (3,700?mi)-long Hawaiian RidgeÿEmperor seamount chain.[6] The prevailing, though not completely settled, view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era.[6][14] However, while Hawaiian volcanism is well understood and extensively studied, there remains no definite explanation of the mechanism that causes the hotspot effect.[15]\\r\\nLava flows from Mauna Kea overlapped in complex layers with those of its neighbors during its growth. Most prominently, Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south.[9] The original eruptive fissures (rift zones) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism.[8] Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of Mauna Kea, was once believed to be a part of the volcano; however, it is now understood to be a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows.[13][16]\\r\\nThe shield-stage lavas that built the enormous main mass of the mountain are tholeiitic basalts, like those of Mauna Loa, created through the mixing of primary magma and subducted oceanic crust.[17] They are covered by the oldest exposed rock strata on Mauna Kea, the post-shield alkali basalts of the Hmkua Volcanics, which erupted between 250,000 and 70ÿ65,000 years ago. The most recent volcanic flows are hawaiites and mugearites: they are the post-shield Lauphoehoe Volcanics, erupted between 65,000 and 4,000 years ago.[13][18] These changes in lava composition accompanied the slow reduction of the supply of magma to the summit, which led to weaker eruptions that then gave way to isolated episodes associated with volcanic dormancy. The Lauphoehoe lavas are more viscous and contain more volatiles than the earlier tholeiitic basalts; their thicker flows significantly steepened Mauna Kea's flanks. In addition, explosive eruptions have built cinder cones near the summit.[3] These cones are the most recent eruptive centers of Mauna Kea. Its present summit is dominated by lava domes and cinder cones up to 1.5?km (0.9?mi) in diameter and hundreds of meters tall.[8]\\r\\nMauna Kea is the only Hawaiian volcano with distinct evidence of glaciation.[8] Similar deposits probably existed on Mauna Loa, but have been covered by later lava flows.[3] Despite Hawaii's tropical location, during several past ice ages a drop of only a degree in temperature allowed snow to remain at the mountain's summit through summer, triggering the formation of an ice cap.[19] There are three episodes of glaciation that have been recorded from the last 180,000 years: the Phakuloa (180ÿ130?ka), Wihu (80ÿ60?ka) and Mkanaka (40ÿ13?ka) series. These have extensively sculpted the summit, depositing moraines and a circular ring of till and gravel along the mountain's upper flanks.[13] Subglacial eruptions built cinder cones during the Mkanaka glaciation,[20] most of which were heavily gouged by glacial action. The most recent cones were built between 9000 and 4500 years ago, atop the glacial deposits,[19][21] although one study indicates that the last eruption may have been around 3600 years ago.[22]\\r\\nAt their maximum extent, the glaciers extended from the summit down to between 3,200 and 3,800?m (10,500 and 12,500?ft) of elevation.[23] A small body of permafrost, less than 25?m (80?ft) across, was found at the summit of Mauna Kea prior to 1974, and may still be present.[13] Small gullies etch the summit, formed by rain- and snow-fed streams that flow only during winter melt and rain showers.[24] On the windward side of the mountain, stream erosion driven by trade winds has accelerated erosion in a manner similar to that on older Kohala.[25]\\r\\nMauna Kea is home to Lake Waiau, the highest lake in the Pacific Basin.[26] At an altitude of 3,969?m (13,022?ft), it lies within the Pu?u Waiau cinder cone and is the only alpine lake in Hawaii. The lake is very small and shallow, with a surface area of 0.73?ha (1.80 acres) and a depth of 3?m (10?ft). Radiocarbon dating of samples at the base of the lake indicates that it was clear of ice 12,600?years ago. Hawaiian lava types are typically permeable, preventing the formation of lakes due to infiltration. Here, either sulfur-bearing steam altered the volcanic ash to low-permeability clays, or explosive interactions between rising magma and groundwater or surface water (phreatic eruptions) formed exceptionally fine ash that also would reduce the permeability of the lake bed.[27]\\r\\nUntil 1993, artesian water was not known to be present in the Island of Hawaii. Drilling by the University of Hawaii at that time encountered an artesian groundwater aquifer at 300 meters below sea level and 100 meters of hole depth within a compacted layer of soil and lava where the flows of both Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea meet (Humuula saddle region). Isotopic composition shows the water present to have been derived from rain coming off Mauna Kea at an elevation higher than 2000 meters above mean sea level. Its presence is attributed to a freshwater head within Mauna Kea's basal lens. Scientists believe there may be more water in Mauna Kea's fresh water lens than current models may indicate.[28] In 2012 two more bore holes were drilled on Mauna Kea and water discovered at much higher elevations than previously believed but shallower than expected. Donald Thomas, director of the University of Hawaii's Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes believes one reason to continue study of the aquifers is due to use and occupancy of the higher elevation areas, stating: \\"Nearly all of these activities depend on the availability of potable water that, in most cases, must be trucked to the Saddle from Waimea or Hilo  an inefficient and expensive process that consumes a substantial quantity of our scarce liquid fuels.[29]\\r\\nThe last eruption of Mauna Kea was about 4,600?years ago (about 2600 BCE);[13] because of this inactivity, Mauna Kea is assigned a United States Geological Survey hazard listing of 7 for its summit and 8 for its lower flanks, out of the lowest possible hazard rating of 9 (which is given to the extinct volcano Kohala). Twenty?percent of the volcano's summit has seen lava flows in the past 10,000?years, and its flanks have seen virtually no lava flows during that time.[30]\\r\\nDespite its dormancy, Mauna Kea is expected to erupt again, although there would be sufficient warning to evacuate. The telescopes on Mauna Kea's summit would be the first to detect the minute amounts of deformation resulting from the volcano's swelling, acting like expensive tiltmeters. Based on prior eruptions, such an event could occur anywhere on the volcano's upper flanks and would likely produce extended lava flows, mostly of a'a, of 15ÿ25?km (9ÿ16?mi) in length. Long periods of activity could build a cinder cone at the source. Although not likely in the next few centuries, such an eruption would probably result in little loss of life but significant damage to infrastructure.[31]\\r\\nThe first Ancient Hawaiians to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where food and water were plentiful. Settlement expanded inland to the Mauna Loa ÿ Mauna Kea region in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Archaeological evidence suggests that these regions were used for hunting, collecting stone material, and possibly for spiritual reasons or for astronomical or navigational observations.[32] The mountain's plentiful forest provided plants and animals for food and raw materials for shelter. Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source.[33]\\r\\nEarly settlement of the Hawaiian islands led to major changes to local ecosystems and many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species. Ancient Hawaiians brought foreign plants and animals, and their arrival was associated with increased rates of erosion.[34] The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change was caused by the use of fire, but the prevailing cause of forest ecosystem collapse and avian extinction on Hawaii appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian (or Pacific) rat.[35]\\r\\nThe summits of the five volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as sacred mountains; and Mauna Kea's summit, the highest, is the most sacred.[36][37] For this reason, a kapu (ancient Hawaiian law) restricted visitor rights to high-ranking ali?i. Hawaiians associated elements of their natural environment with particular deities. In Hawaiian mythology, the summit of Mauna Kea was seen as the \\"region of the gods\\", a place where benevolent spirits reside. Poli?ahu, deity of snow, also resides there.[33] In Hawaiian, Mauna Kea is a shortened form of Mauna a Wakea which denotes the mountain's connection to the sky father Wakea;[38] however, the English translation of Mauna Kea is \\"white mountain\\" in reference to its seasonally snow-capped summit.[39]\\r\\nAround AD?1100, natives established adze quarries high up on Mauna Kea to extract the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and mmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD?1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.[33]\\r\\nLake Waiau provided drinking water for the workers. Native chiefs would also dip the umbilical cords of newborn babies in its water, to give them the strength of the mountain. Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.[33]\\r\\nThis early era was followed by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long-term welfare of the environment. These ahupua?a generally took the form of long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast. Mauna Kea's summit was encompassed in the ahupua?a of Ka?ohe, with part of its eastern slope reaching into the nearby Humu?ula. Principal sources of nutrition for Hawaiians living on the slopes of the volcano came from the mmaneÿnaio forest of its upper slopes, which provided them with vegetation and bird life. Bird species hunted included the ?ua?u (Pterodroma sandwichensis), nn (Branta sandvicensis), and palila (Loxioides bailleui). The lower koaÿ?hi?a forest gave the natives wood for canoes and ornate bird feathers for decoration.[33]\\r\\nThere are three accounts of foreigners visiting Hawaii before the arrival of James Cook, in 1778.[40][41][42] However, the earliest Western depictions of the isle, including Mauna Kea, were created by explorers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Contact with Europe and America had major consequences for island residents. Native Hawaiians were devastated by introduced diseases; port cities including Hilo, Kealakekua, and Kailua grew with the establishment of trade; and the adze quarries on Mauna Kea were abandoned after the introduction of metal tools.[33]\\r\\nIn 1793, cattle were brought by George Vancouver as a tribute to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped confinement and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended Kamehameha?I, who put him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional land grant in 1845, Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle ranch that is still in operation today.[33] Settlers to the island burned and cut down much of the native forest for the construction of sugarcane plantations and houses.[43]\\r\\nThe Saddle Road, named for its crossing of the saddle-shaped plateau between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, was completed in 1943, and eased travel to Mauna Kea considerably.[24]\\r\\nThe Pohakuloa Training Area on the plateau is the largest military training ground in Hawaii. The 108,863-acre (44,055?ha) base extends from the volcano's lower flanks to 2,070?m (6,790?ft) elevation, on state land leased to the US Army since 1956. There are 15?threatened and endangered plants, 3?endangered birds, and 1?endangered bat species in the area.[24]\\r\\nMauna Kea has been the site of extensive archaeological research since the 1980s. Approximately 27?percent of the Science Reserve had been surveyed by 2000, identifying 76?shrines, 4?adze manufacturing workshops, 3?other markers, 1?positively identified burial site, and 4?possible burial sites.[33] By 2009, the total number of identified sites had risen to 223, and archaeological research on the volcano's upper flanks is ongoing.[24] It has been suggested that the shrines, which are arranged around the volcano's summit along what may be an ancient snow line, are markers for the transition to the sacred part of Mauna Kea. Despite many references to burial around Mauna Kea in Hawaiian oral history, few sites have been confirmed. The lack of shrines or other artifacts on the many cinder cones dotting the volcano may be because they were reserved for burial.[33]\\r\\nIn pre-contact times, natives traveling up Mauna Kea were probably guided more by landscape than by existing trails, as no evidence of the latter has been found. It is possible that natural ridges and water sources were followed instead. Individuals likely took trips up Mauna Kea's slopes to visit family-maintained shrines near its summit, and traditions related to ascending the mountain exist to this day. However, very few natives actually reached the summit, because of the strict kapu placed on it.[33]\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, the earliest notable recorded ascents of Mauna Kea included the following:\\r\\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed, often by the movement of game herds, that could be traveled on horseback.[33] However, vehicular access to the summit was practically impossible until the construction of a road in 1964, and it continues to be restricted.[45] Today, multiple trails to the summit exist, in various states of use.[24]\\r\\nHawaii's geographical isolation strongly influences its ecology. Remote islands like Hawaii have a large number of species that are found nowhere else (see Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands).[46] The remoteness resulted in evolutionary lines distinct from those elsewhere and isolated these endemic species from external biotic influence, and also makes them especially vulnerable to extinction and the effects of invasive species. In addition the ecosystems of Hawaii are under threat from human development including the clearing of land for agriculture; an estimated third of the island's endemic species have already been wiped out. Because of its elevation, Mauna Kea has the greatest diversity of biotic ecosystems anywhere in the Hawaiian archipelago. Ecosystems on the mountain form concentric rings along its slopes due to changes in temperature and precipitation with elevation.[43] These ecosystems can be roughly divided into three sections by elevation: alpineÿsubalpine, montane, and basal forest.[4]\\r\\nContact with Americans and Europeans in the early 19th century brought more settlers to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koaÿ?hi?a forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native mmaneÿnaio forest.[47] Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.[48]\\r\\nThe summit of Mauna Kea lies above the tree line, and consists of mostly lava rock and alpine tundra. An area of heavy snowfall, it is inhospitable to vegetation, and is known as the Hawaiian tropical high shrublands. Growth is restricted here by extremely cold temperatures, a short growing season, low rainfall, and snow during winter months. A lack of soil also retards root growth, makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from the ground, and gives the area a very low water retention capacity.[4]\\r\\nPlant species found at this elevation include Styphelia tameiameiae, Taraxacum officinale, Tetramolopium humile, Agrostis sandwicensis, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Trisetum glomeratum, Poa annua, Sonchus oleraceus, and Coprosma ernodiodes. One notable species is Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense var. sandwicense), a highly endangered endemic plant species that thrives in Mauna Kea's high elevation cinder deserts. At one stage reduced to a population of just 50 plants,[49] Mauna Kea silversword was thought to be restricted to the alpine zone, but in fact has been driven there by pressure from livestock, and can grow at lower elevations as well.[4]\\r\\nThe Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve on the southern summit flank of Mauna Kea was established in 1981. The reserve is a region of sparsely vegetated cinder deposits and lava rock, including areas of aeolian desert and Lake Waiau.[50] This ecosystem is a likely haven for the threatened ?ua?u (Pterodroma sandwichensis) and also the center of a study on wkiu bugs (Nysius wekiuicola).[25]\\r\\nWkiu bugs feed on dead insect carcasses that drift up Mauna Kea on the wind and settle on snow banks. This is a highly unusual food source for a species in the genus Nysius, which consists of predominantly seed-eating insects. They can survive at extreme elevations of up to 4,200?m (13,780?ft)[51] because of natural antifreeze in their blood. They also stay under heated surfaces most of the time. Their conservation status is unclear, but the species is no longer a candidate for the Endangered Species List; studies on the welfare of the species began in 1980. The closely related Nysius aa lives on Mauna Loa. Wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and forest tent caterpillar moths have also been observed in the same Mauna Kea ecosystem; the former survive by hiding under heat-absorbing rocks, and the latter through cold-resistant chemicals in their bodies.[52]\\r\\nThe highest forested zone on the volcano, at an elevation of 2,000ÿ3,000?m (6,600ÿ9,800?ft), is dominated by mmane (Sophora chrysophylla) and naio (Myoporum sandwicense), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as mmaneÿnaio forest. Mmane seeds and naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone, especially the palila (Loxioides bailleui). The palila was formerly found on the slopes of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and Huallai, but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Keaonly 10% of its former rangeand has been declared critically endangered.[43]\\r\\nThe largest threat to the ecosystem is grazing by feral sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos primigenius),[53] and goats (Capra hircus) introduced to the island in the late 18th century. Feral animal competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed as far back as the late 1920s,[43] and continued through to 1949. One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of herbaceous and woody plants, both endemic and introduced, that were resistant to browsing.[53] The feral animals were almost eradicated, and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s. However, an influx of local hunters led to the feral species being valued as game animals, and in 1959 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the governing body in charge of conservation and land use management, changed its policy to a sustained-control program designed to facilitate the sport.[43]\\r\\nMouflon (Ovis aries orientalis) was introduced from 1962ÿ1964,[54] and a plan to release axis deer (Axis axis) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who said that they would damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (1978).[43][55]\\r\\nThe court ruled in favor of conservationists and upheld the precedence of federal laws before state control of wildlife. Having violated the Endangered Species Act, Hawaii state was required to remove all feral animals from the mountainside.[43] This decision was followed by a second court order in 1981. A public hunting program removed many of the feral animals,[47] at least temporarily. An active control program is in place,[24] though it is not conducted with sufficient rigor to allow significant recovery of the mmane-naio ecosystem.[56] There are many other species and ecosystems on the island, and on Mauna Kea, that remain threatened by human development and invasive species.[43]\\r\\nThe Mauna Kea Forest Reserve protects 52,500 acres (212?km2) of mmane-naio forest under the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources. Ungulate hunting is allowed year-round.[24] A small part of the mmaneÿnaio forest is encompassed by the Mauna Kea State Recreation Area.[57]\\r\\nA band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was formerly Acacia koa ÿ Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-?hi?a) forest.[4] Its destruction was driven by an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and those parts of the forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui.[47] With the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.[24][58]\\r\\nThe Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge is a major koa forest reserve on Mauna Kea's windward slope. It was established in 1985, covering 32,733 acres (13,247?ha) of ecosystem remnant. Eight endangered bird species, twelve endangered plants, and the endangered Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus semotus) have been observed in the area, in addition to many other rare biota. The reserve has been the site of an extensive replanting campaign since 1989.[59] Parts of the reserve show the effect of agriculture on the native ecosystem,[47] as much of the land in the upper part of the reserve is abandoned farmland.[59]\\r\\nBird species native to the acacia koaÿ?hi?a forest include the Hawaiian crow (Corvus hawaiiensis), the ?akepa (Loxops coccineus), Hawaii creeper (Oreomystis mana), ?akiapl?au (Hemignathus munroi), and Hawaiian hawk (Buteo solitarius), all of which are endangered, threatened, or near threatened; the Hawaiian crow in particular is extinct in the wild, but there are plans to reintroduce the species into the Hakalau reserve.[59]\\r\\nMauna Kea's summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation due to favorable observing conditions.[24][60][61] The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects.[60] These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.[45]\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, the Hawaii Island Chamber of Commerce encouraged astronomical development of Mauna Kea, as economic stimulus; this coincided with University of Arizona astronomer Gerard Kuiper's search for sites to use newly improved detectors of infrared light. Site testing by Kuiper's assistant Alika Herring in 1964 confirmed the summit's outstanding suitability. An intense three-way competition for NASA funds to construct a large telescope began between Kuiper, Harvard University, and the University of Hawaii (UH), which only had experience in solar astronomy. This culminated in funds being awarded to the \\"upstart\\" UH proposal.[62] UH rebuilt its small astronomy department into a new Institute for Astronomy, and in 1968 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources gave it a 65-year lease for all land within a 4?km (2.5?mi) radius of its telescope, essentially that above 11,500?ft (3,505?m).[24][60] On its completion in 1970, the UH 88?in (2.2?m) was the seventh largest optical/infrared telescope in the world.[62]\\r\\nBy 1970, two 24?in (0.6?m) telescopes had been constructed by the US Air Force and Lowell Observatory. In 1973, Canada and France agreed to build the 3.6?m CFHT on Mauna Kea.[62] However, local organisations started to raise concerns about the environmental impact of the observatory. This led the Department of Land and Natural Resources to prepare an initial management plan, drafted in 1977 and supplemented in 1980. In January 1982, the UH Board of Regents approved a plan to support the continued development of scientific facilities at the site.[24] In 1998, 2,033 acres (823?ha) were transferred from the observatory lease to supplement the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve. The 1982 plan was replaced in 2000 by an extension designed to serve until 2020: it instituted an Office of Mauna Kea Management,[61] designated 525 acres (212?ha) for astronomy, and shifted the remaining 10,763 acres (4,356?ha) to \\"natural and cultural preservation\\". This plan was further revised to address concern expressed in the Hawaiian community that a lack of respect was being shown toward the cultural values of the mountain.[24]\\r\\nToday the Mauna Kea Science Reserve has 13 observation facilities, each funded by as many as 11 countries.[63] There are nine telescopes working in the visible and infrared spectrum, three in the submillimeter spectrum, and one in the radio spectrum, with mirrors or dishes ranging from 0.9 to 25?m (3 to 82?ft).[64] In comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope has a 2.4?m (7.9?ft) mirror, similar in size to the UH88, now the second smallest telescope on the mountain.[64]\\r\\nA \\"Save Mauna Kea\\" movement, believes development of the mountain to be sacrilegious.[65] Native Hawaiian non-profit groups such as Kahea, concerned with cultural heritage and the environment also oppose development for cultural and religious reasons.[66] The multi-telescope \\"outrigger\\", proposed in 2006 was eventually canceled.[67] A planned new telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), has attracted controversy and protests.[68][69] The TMT was approved in April 2013.[70] In October 2014, the groundbreaking ceremony for the telescope was interrupted by protesters causing the project to temporarily halt.[71] In late March 2015, demonstrators blocked access of the road to the summit again.[72] On April 2, 2015, 300 protestors were gathered near the visitor's center when 12 people were arrested with 11 more arrested at the summit.[73][74] Among the concerns of the protest groups are the land appraisals and Native Hawaiians consultation.[73] Construction was halted on April 7, 2015 after protests expanded over the state.[75] After several halts, the project has been voluntarily postponed. Governor Ige announced substantial changes to the management of Mauna Kea in the future but stated the project can move forward.[76] A pending court case has been accepted by the Supreme Court of Hawaii over the project by a number of groups.[77]\\r\\nThe summit of Mauna Kea has an alpine climate. Due to the influence of its tropical latitude, temperature swings are very low in spite of its high elevation. Frosts are common year round, but in spite of the elevation no month is nearly below freezing in terms of average high, although March almost falls below 32?F (0?C) in average means.\\r\\nMauna Kea's coastline is dominated by the Hamakua Coast, an area of rugged terrain created by frequent slumps and landslides on the volcano's flank.[79] The area includes several recreation parks including Kalopa State Recreation Area, Wailuku River State Park and Akaka Falls State Park.[80]\\r\\nThere are over 3,000 registered hunters on Hawaii island, and hunting, for both recreation and sustenance, is a common activity on Mauna Kea. A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs, sheep, goats, turkey, pheasants, and quail.[24][43] The Mauna Kea State Recreation Area functions as a base camp for the sport.[45] Birdwatching is also common at lower levels on the mountain.[60] A popular site is Kؐpuka Pu'u Huluhulu, a kؐpuka on Mauna Kea's flank that formed when lava flows isolated the forest on a hill.[81]\\r\\nMauna Kea's great elevation and the steepness of its flanks provide a better view and a shorter hike than the adjacent Mauna Loa. The high elevation with its risk of altitude sickness, weather concerns, steep road grade, and overall inaccessibility make the volcano dangerous and summit trips difficult. Until the construction of roads in the mid-20th century, only the hardy visited Mauna Kea's upper slopes; hunters tracked game animals, and hikers traveled up the mountain. These travelers used stone cabins constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s as base camps, and it is from these facilities that the modern mid-level Onizuka Center for International Astronomy telescope support complex is derived. The first Mauna Kea summit road was built in 1964, making the peak itself accessible to larger numbers of people.[45]\\r\\nToday, multiple hiking trails exist, including the Mauna Kea Trail, and by 2007 over 100,000 tourists and 32,000 vehicles were going each year to the Visitor Information Station (VIS) adjacent to the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy. The Mauna Kea Access Road is paved up to the Center at 2,804?m (9,199?ft).[24] One study reported that around a third of visitors and two thirds of professional astronomers working on the mountain have experienced symptoms of acute altitude sickness;[82] visitors traveling up the volcano's flanks are advised to stop for at least half an hour and preferably longer at the visitor center to acclimate to the higher elevation. It is strongly recommended to use a four-wheel drive vehicle to drive all the way to the top. Brakes often overheat on the way down and there is no fuel available on Mauna Kea.[83] A free Star Gazing Program is held at the VIS every night from 6-10 pm.[84] Between 5,000 and 6,000 people visit the summit of Mauna Kea each year, and to help ensure safety, and protect the integrity of the mountain, a ranger program was implemented in 2001.[24]","input":"What is the tallest volcano in hawaiian islands?"},{"output":"Springer Mountain","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Appalachian National Scenic Trail, generally known as the Appalachian Trail or simply the A.T., is a marked hiking trail in the Eastern United States extending between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine.[1] The trail is estimated around 2,200 miles (3,500?km)[a] long, though the exact length changes over time as parts are modified or rerouted. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy reports that the Appalachian Trail is the longest hiking-only trail in the world.[2] More than 2 million people are said to take a hike on part of the trail at least once each year.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of the Appalachian Trail came about in 1921. The trail itself was completed in 1937 after more than a decade of work, although improvements and changes continue. It is maintained by 31 trail clubs and multiple partnerships,[4] and managed by the National Park Service, United States Forest Service, and the nonprofit Appalachian Trail Conservancy.[5][6] Most of the trail is in forest or wild lands, although some portions traverse towns, roads and farms. It passes through 14 states: Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThru-hikers attempt to hike the trail in its entirety in a single season. More than 2,700 people thru-hiked the trail in 2014 and many books, documentaries, websites, and fan organizations are dedicated to the pursuit. Some hike from one end to the other, then turn around and thru-hike the trail the other way, known as a \\"yo-yo\\".[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn extension known as the International Appalachian Trail continues northeast, crossing Maine and cutting through Canada to Newfoundland, with sections continuing in Greenland, through Europe, and into Morocco. Other separate extensions continue the southern end of the Appalachian range in Alabama and continue south into Florida, creating what is known as the Eastern Continental Trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Appalachian Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, and the Pacific Crest Trail form what is known as the Triple Crown of Hiking in the United States.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trail was conceived by Benton MacKaye, a forester who wrote his original plancalled \\"An Appalachian Trail, A Project in Regional Planning\\"[10]shortly after the death of his wife in 1921. MacKaye's idea detailed a grand trail that would connect a series of farms and wilderness work/study camps for city-dwellers. In 1922, at the suggestion of Major William A. Welch, director of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, his idea was publicized by Raymond H. Torrey with a story in the New York Evening Post under a full-page banner headline reading \\"A Great Trail from Maine to Georgia!\\" The idea was quickly adopted by the new Palisades Interstate Park Trail Conference as their main project.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 7, 1923, the first section of the trail, from Bear Mountain west through Harriman State Park to Arden, New York, was opened. MacKaye then called for a two-day Appalachian Trail conference to be held in March 1925 in Washington, D.C. This meeting inspired the formation of the Appalachian Trail Conference (now called the Appalachian Trail Conservancy) (ATC).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nA retired judge named Arthur Perkins and his younger associate Myron Avery took up the cause. In 1929, Perkins, who was also a member of the Connecticut Forest and Park Association and its Blue Blazed Trails committee, found Ned Anderson, a farmer in Sherman, Connecticut, who took on the task of mapping and blazing the Connecticut leg of the trail (1929ÿ1933). It ran from Dog Tail Corners in Webatuck, New York, which borders Kent, Connecticut, at Ashley Falls, 50 miles (80?km) through the northwest corner of the state, up to Bear Mountain at the Massachusetts border.[12] (A portion of the Connecticut trail has since been rerouted (1979ÿ1983) to be more scenic, adhering less to highways and more to wilderness, and includes a Ned K. Anderson Memorial Bridge.)[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnderson's efforts helped spark renewed interest in the trail, and Avery (who led the charge after Perkins' death in 1932) was able to bring other states on board. Upon taking over the ATC, Avery adopted the more practical goal of building a simple hiking trail. He and MacKaye clashed over the ATC's response to a major commercial development along the trail's path; MacKaye left the organization, while Avery was willing to simply reroute the trail. Avery reigned as Chairman of the ATC from 1932 to 1952 (he died that same year).[14][citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAvery became the first to walk the trail end-to-end, though not as a thru-hike, in 1936. In August 1937, the trail was completed to Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine, and the ATC shifted its focus toward protecting the trail lands and mapping the trail for hikers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the trail's present highlights were not part of the trail in 1937: Roan Mountain, North Carolina and Tennessee; the Mount Rogers high country, including Grayson Highlands, Virginia; the Pochuck Creek swamp, New Jersey; Nuclear Lake, New York; Thundering Falls, Vermont; and Saddleback Mountain, Maine. Except for places where the Civilian Conservation Corps was brought in (mostly in Shenandoah National Park, the Great Smoky Mountains, and Maine), the original trail often climbed straight up and down mountains, creating rough hiking conditions and a treadway prone to severe erosion. The ATC's trail crews and volunteer trail-maintaining clubs have relocated or rehabilitated miles of trail since that time.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1936, A 121-day Maine to Georgia veteran's group funded and supported thru-hike was reported to have been completed, with all but three miles of the new trail cleared and blazed, by six Boy Scouts from New York City and their guides.[16] The completed thru-hike was much later recorded and accepted by the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1938, the trail sustained major damage from a hurricane that went through the New England area. This happened right before the start of World War II and many of the people working on the trail were called to active duty.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1948, Earl Shaffer of York, Pennsylvania, brought a great deal of attention to the project by publicizing the first claimed thru-hike. The claim was later criticized for the hike's omission of significant portions due to short-cuts and car rides.[19][20][21] Shaffer later claimed the first north-to-south thru-hike, the first to claim to do so in each direction.[22] Chester Dziengielewski was later to be named the first south bound thru-hiker.[19] In 1998, Shaffer, nearly 80 years old, hiked the trail, making him the oldest person to claim a completed thru-hike.[23][24] The first solo woman to complete the hike was 67-year old Emma Gatewood who completed the northbound trek in 1955, taking 146 days. She repeated the achievement two years later.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s, the ATC made progress toward protecting the trail from development, thanks to efforts of politicians and officials. The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail as the first national scenic trails and paved the way for a series of National Scenic Trails within the National Park and National Forest systems.[26] Trail volunteers worked with the National Park Service to map a permanent route for the trail, and by 1971 a permanent route had been marked (though minor changes continue to this day). By the close of the 20th century, the Park Service had completed the purchase of all but a few miles of the trail's span.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Appalachian Trail is a 1,900-mile (3,100?km) extension running northeast from Maine into New Brunswick and Quebec's Gasp Peninsula, where it ends at Forillon National Park. It is a separate trail and not an official extension of the Appalachian Trail.[27] Other branches are designated in parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and along the western shore of Newfoundland, to the northern end of the Appalachian Mountain range, where it enters the Atlantic Ocean, near L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site. The route has since been extended to Greenland, Europe, and Morocco.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Appalachian Trail ends in Georgia, the Appalachian Mountains continue south to Flagg Mountain in Alabama.[29] In 2008, the Pinhoti National Recreation Trail in Alabama and Georgia, which terminates at Flagg Mountain, was connected to the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail via the Benton MacKaye Trail. Promoters of the Southern extension refer to MacKaye's statement at the 1925 conference that the Georgia to New Hampshire trail should, in the future, extend to Katahdin, and \\"then to Birmingham, Alabama\\". As of  March 2015[update], The Pinhoti Trail terminates at the base of Flagg Mountain, near Weogufka in Coosa County, 50 miles (80?km) east of Birmingham.[30][31] In 2010, the Alabama state legislature formed the Alabama Appalachian Mountain Trail Commission to provide state resources for trail improvements, although officially designating Pinhoti as part of the Appalachian Trail would require an act of the United States Congress.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 8.8-mile (14.2?km) Appalachian Approach Trail begins at Amicalola Falls State Park's visitor center and ends at Springer Mountain.[33] Because Springer Mountain is in a remote area, the Approach Trail is often the beginning of North bound thru-hike attempts. Much of the Approach Trail was originally built as part of the Appalachian Trail, before the southern terminus was relocated from Mount Oglethorpe to Springer Mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Appalachian Trail is home to thousands of species of plants and animals, including 2,000 rare, threatened, endangered, and sensitive plant and animal species.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American black bear (Ursus americanus), among the largest animals along the Appalachian Trail, rarely confronts people.[35] The black bear is the largest omnivore that may be encountered on the trail, and it inhabits all regions of the Appalachians.[36] Bear sightings on the trail are uncommon, except in certain sections, especially Shenandoah National Park and portions of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts sections, where bear populations have increased steadily since 1980; confrontations are rarer still.[35]\\r\\nOther hazards include venomous snakes, including the Eastern timber rattlesnake and copperhead, which are common along the trail. Both snakes are generally found in drier, rockier sections of the trail; the copperhead's range extends north to around the New JerseyÿNew York state line, while rattlesnakes are commonly found along the trail in Connecticut and have been reported, although rarely, as far north as New Hampshire.[37] Other large mammals commonly sighted include deer;[38] elk, reintroduced in the Smoky Mountains; and moose, which may be found in the vicinity of Massachusetts and northward.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall mammal species that inhabit along the trails are beaver, squirrel, river otter, chipmunk, porcupine, bobcat, two species of fox, boar, woodchuck, raccoon, and coyote. Bird species that reside in the trails are wild turkey, ruffed grouse, mourning dove, raven, two species of eagle, wood duck, three species of owl, and three species of hawk as well as warblers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most hikers, the most persistent pests along the trail are ticks, mosquitos, and black flies along with the mice that inhabit shelters.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlant life along the trail is varied. The trail passes through several different biomes from south to north, and the climate changes significantly, particularly dependent upon elevation. In the south, lowland forests consist mainly of second-growth; nearly the entire trail has been logged at one time or another. There are, however, a few old growth locations along the trail, such as Sages Ravine straddling the Massachusetts-Connecticut border and atop higher peaks along the trail on either side of the same border, the Hopper (a glacial cirque westward of the trail as it traverses Mt. Greylock in Massachusetts), and \\"The Hermitage\\", near Gulf Hagas in Maine. In the south, the forest is dominated by hardwoods, including oak and tulip trees, also known as yellow poplar.[41] Farther north, tulip trees are gradually replaced by maples and birches. Oaks begin to disappear in Massachusetts. By Vermont, the lowland forest is made up of maples, birch and beech, with colorful foliage displays in September and October.[38] While the vast majority of lowland forest south of the White Mountains is hardwood, many areas have some coniferous trees as well, and in Maine, these often grow at low elevations.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a drastic change between the lowland and subalpine, evergreen forest, as well as another, higher break, at tree line, above which only hardy alpine plants grow.[41] The sub-alpine region is far more prevalent along the trail than true alpine conditions. While it mainly exists in the north, a few mountains in the south have subalpine environments, which are typically coated in an ecosystem known as the Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest. Southern ranges and mountains where sub-alpine environments occur include the Great Smoky Mountains, where sub-alpine environments only begin around 6,000 feet (1,800?m) in elevation, Roan Highlands on the North Carolina-Tennessee border, where sub-alpine growth descends below 6,000 feet (1,800?m), and Mount Rogers and the Grayson Highlands in Virginia, where there is some alpine growth above 5,000 feet (1,500?m). Appalachian balds are also found in the Southern highlands, and are believed to occur due to fires or grazing in recent centuries, or in some cases due to thin, sandy soils.[42] Several balds are sprouting trees, and on some, the National Forest service actually mows the grasses periodically in order to keep the balds free of trees.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sub-alpine regions exist between Mount Rogers in Virginia and Mount Greylock in Massachusetts, mainly because the trail stays below 3,000 feet (910?m) from Shenandoah National Park in Virginia to Mount Greylock. Mount Greylock, however, has a large subalpine region, the only such forest in Massachusetts, extending down to 3,000 feet (910?m), which in the south would be far from the sub-alpine cutoff. This is especially low because Greylock is exposed to prevailing westerly winds, as the summits along its ridgeline rise approximately 200 to 650 feet (61 to 198?m) higher than any other peak in Massachusetts. Farther north, several peaks in Vermont reach into the sub-alpine zone, the bottom of which steadily descends as one proceeds northward, so that by the White Mountains in New Hampshire, it often occurs well below 3,000 feet (910?m). At Mount Moosilauke, which summits at 4,802 feet (1,464?m), the first alpine environment on the trail is reached, where only thin, sporadic flora is interspersed with bare rocks. Between the two regions is the krummholz region, where stunted trees grow with their branches oriented away from the winter's prevailing northwest wind, thus giving the appearance of flags (they are often called \\"flag trees\\"). This region resembles lowland terrain hundreds of miles north in Canada. It also contains many endangered and threatened species. The trail has been rerouted over New Hampshire's Presidential Range so the Appalachian Mountain Club can protect certain plant life. The alpine cutoff in the Whites is generally between 4,200 and 4,800 feet (1,300 and 1,500?m). Mountains traversed by the A.T. above treeline include Mount Moosilauke, several miles along the Franconia Range and along the Presidential Range. In the Presidentials, the trail climbs as high as 6,288 feet (1,917?m) on Mount Washington and spends about 13 miles (21?km) continuously above treeline, in the largest alpine environment in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe segments of the trail through Pennsylvania are so rocky that hikers refer to the region as \\"Rocksylvania\\".[43] These small rocksthe result of erosion that has worn away the dirt along the trailscan be tough to walk on for extended periods of time without proper hard-soled shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Maine, the trail extends into even harsher environments, and sub-alpine and alpine growth descends to lower elevations. Alpine growth in the state ranges from around 2,500 feet (760?m) in the Mahoosuc Range to below 1,000 feet (300?m) in parts of the Hundred-Mile Wilderness,[44] where nearly every area higher than 1,000 feet (300?m) is evergreen forest. These forests include more species of evergreen, as well. In addition to the white pine, spruce and hemlock prevalent further south, Maine has many cedar trees along the trail. Near the northern terminus, there are even some tamarack (larch), a coniferous, pine-needled deciduous tree, which provides displays of yellow in the late fall after the birches and maples have gone bare. The hemlocks in Maine are also notable, as the woolly adelgid, which has ravaged populations further south, has not come into the state yet, and may be unable to make it so far north due to the cold climate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaine also has several alpine regions. In addition to several areas of the Mahoosuc Range, the Baldpates and Old Blue in southern Maine have alpine characteristics despite elevations below 4,000 feet (1,200?m). Saddleback Mountain and Mount Bigelow, further north, each only extend a bit above 4,000 feet (1,200?m), but have long alpine areas, with no tree growth on the summits and unobstructed views on clear days. From Mount Bigelow, the trail extends for 150 miles (240?km) with only a small area of alpine growth around 3,500 feet (1,100?m) on the summit of White Cap Mountain. Mount Katahdin, the second largest alpine environment in the eastern United States, has several square miles of alpine area on the flat \\"table land\\" summit as well as the cliffs and aretes leading up to it. Treeline on Mount Katahdin is only around 3,500 feet (1,100?m). This elevation in Massachusetts would barely be a sub-alpine region, and, south of Virginia, consists of lowland forest. This illustrates the drastic change in climate over 2,000 miles (3,200?km).\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the alpine environments well below 5,000 feet (1,500?m) in New Hampshire and Maine, some higher places farther south are not alpine. Examples include Wayah Bald in North Carolina 5,342 feet (1,628?m) and Clingmans Dome in Great Smoky Mountains National Park 6,643 feet (2,025?m).\\r\\n\\r\\nBicycles are prohibited from most of the trail, except for the sections which follow the C&O Canal in Maryland and the Virginia Creeper Trail in Virginia. Horses and pack animals are prohibited except horses on the C&O Canal and in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[45] Several short segments of the trail, in towns and scenic natural areas, were built to ADA accessibly standards for wheelchair use.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout its length, the AT is marked by white paint blazes that are 2 by 6 inches (5 by 15?cm). Side trails to shelters, viewpoints and parking areas use similarly shaped blue blazes. In past years, some sections of the trail also used metal diamond markers with the AT logo, few of which survive.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal 1930 ATC copper marker from a tree in New Jersey\\r\\n\\r\\nAn old metal diamond marker beside the trail in Maine\\r\\n\\r\\nA typical white AT blaze along the trail in Pennsylvania\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of a side-trail blue blaze, from Mount Greylock in Massachusetts\\r\\n\\r\\nMost hikers carry a lightweight tent, tent hammock or tarp.[47] The trail has more than 250 shelters and campsites available for hikers.[48] The shelters, sometimes called lean-tos (in Maine, Massachusetts, and Connecticut), huts (in Shenandoah National Park), or Adirondack shelters, are generally open, three-walled structures with a wooden floor, although some shelters are much more complex in structure. Shelters are usually spaced a day's hike or less apart, most often near a water source (which may be dry) and with a privy. They generally have spaces for tent sites in the vicinity as the shelters may be full.[1] The Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) operates a system of eight huts along 56 miles (90?km) of New Hampshire's White Mountains.[38] These huts are significantly larger than standard trail shelters and offer full-service lodging and meals during the summer months. The Fontana Dam Shelter in North Carolina is more commonly referred to as the Fontana Hilton because of amenities (e.g. flush toilets) and its proximity to an all-you-can-eat buffet and post office.[48][49] Several AMC huts have an extended self-service season during the fall, with two extending self-service seasons through the winter and spring.[50] The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club maintains trail cabins, shelters, and huts throughout the Shenandoah region of Virginia.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nShelters are generally maintained by local volunteers. Almost all shelters have one or more pre-hung food hangers (generally consisting of a short nylon cord with an upside-down tuna can suspended halfway down its length) where hikers can hang their food bags to keep them out of the reach of rodents. In hiker lingo, these are sometimes called \\"mouse trapezes.\\"[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to official shelters, many people offer their homes, places of business, or inns to accommodate AT hikers. One example is the Little Lyford Pond camps maintained by the Appalachian Mountain Club. Inns are more common in sections of the trail that coincide with national parks, most notably Virginia's Shenandoah National Park.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trail crosses many roads, thus providing ample opportunity for hikers to hitchhike into town for food and other supplies. Many trail towns are accustomed to hikers passing through, and thus many have hotels and hiker-oriented accommodations.[1] Some of the most well-known trail towns are Hot Springs, North Carolina; Erwin, Tennessee; Damascus, Virginia; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; Duncannon, Pennsylvania; Port Clinton, Pennsylvania; Wingdale, New York; Kent, Connecticut; Salisbury, Connecticut; Great Barrington, Massachusetts; Hanover, New Hampshire; Lincoln, New Hampshire; Gorham, New Hampshire and Monson, Maine. In the areas of the trail closer to trail towns, many hikers have experienced what is sometimes called \\"trail magic,\\"[53] or assistance from strangers through kind actions, gifts, and other forms of encouragement.[54] Trail magic is sometimes done anonymously.[55] In other instances, persons have provided food and cooked for hikers at a campsite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Appalachian Trail is relatively safe. Most injuries or incidents are consistent with comparable outdoor activities. Most hazards are related to weather conditions, human error, plants, animals, diseases, and hostile humans encountered along the trail.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany animals live around the trail, with bears, snakes, and wild boars posing the greatest threat to human safety. Several rodent- and bug-borne illnesses are also a potential hazard. In scattered instances, foxes, raccoons, and other small animals may bite hikers, posing risk of rabies and other diseases. There has been one reported case (in 1993) of hantavirus (HPS), a rare but dangerous rodent-borne disease affecting the lungs. The afflicted hiker recovered and hiked the trail the following year.[56] The section of the trail that runs through the Mid-Atlantic and New England states has a very high population of deer ticks carrying Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, and corresponds to the highest density of reported Lyme Disease in the country.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoison ivy is common the length of the trail, and more plentiful in the South.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather is another major consideration of hikers on the trail. Hiking season of the trail generally starts in mid-to-late spring, when conditions are much more favorable in the South. However, this time may also be characterized by extreme heat, sometimes in excess of 100?F (38?C). Under such conditions, hydration is imperative. Light clothing and sunscreens are a must at high elevations and areas without foliage, even in relatively cool weather.[56] Farther north and at higher elevations, the weather can be cold, characterized by low temperatures, strong winds, hail or snow storms and reduced visibility. Prolonged rain, though not typically life-threatening, can undermine stamina and ruin supplies.[57] In March 2015, a hiker was killed on the trail in Maryland when a large tree blew over and fell onto him.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nViolent crime, including murder, has occurred on the trail in a few instances. Most have been crimes by non-hikers who crossed paths relatively randomly with the AT hiker-victims. The official website of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy points out that the number of violent crimes is extremely low when compared against the number of people (3 to 4 million) who hike on the trail every year.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first reported homicide on the trail was in 1974 in Georgia.[60] In 1981, the issue of violence on the Appalachian Trail received national attention when Robert Mountford, Jr. and Laura Susan Ramsay, both social workers in Ellsworth, Maine, were murdered by Randall Lee Smith.[61] Another homicide occurred in May 1996, when two women were abducted, bound and murdered near the trail in Shenandoah National Park. The primary suspect was later discovered harassing a female cyclist in the vicinity,[62] but charges against him were dropped, and the case remains unsolved.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman error can lead to casualties as well. In July 2013, 66-year-old lone hiker Geraldine Largay disappeared on the trail in Maine. She got very lost and survived 26 days before dying. Her remains were found 2 years later in October 2015.[64] In October 2015, a hiker visiting from England was killed on the trail by falling while taking photos at the Annapolis Rocks overlook in Maryland.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrail hikers who attempt to complete the entire trail in a single season are called \\"thru-hikers\\"; those who traverse the trail during a series of separate trips are known as \\"section-hikers\\". Rugged terrain, weather extremes, illness, injury, and the time and effort required make thru-hiking difficult to accomplish. Per 2014 estimates around 2700 hikers attempted to thru-hike the trail.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, only about 10% to 15% of those who make the attempt report to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy that they completed it.[66] However, since 2001, the number of people starting out in Georgia to do a thru-hike (or at least registering to do so) has dropped considerably, yet the number of people reporting that they have completed a thru-hike has remained approximately the same. This has resulted in an apparent increase in the completion rate to 29% (as of 2006).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Appalachian Trail is usually thru-hiked south to north (that is, Georgia to Maine) rather than vice versa. Hikers typically begin in March or April and finish in late summer or early to late fall of that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nA thru-hike generally requires five to seven months, although some have done it in three months, and several trail runners have completed the trail in less time. Trail runners typically tackle the AT with automobile support teams, without backpacks, and without camping in the woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThru-hikers are classified into many informal groups. \\"Purists\\" are hikers who stick to the official AT trail, follow the white blazes, except for side trips to shelters and camp sites. \\"Blue Blazers\\" cut miles from the full route by taking side trails marked by blue blazes. The generally pejorative name \\"Yellow Blazers,\\" a reference to yellow road stripes, is given to those who hitchhike to move either down or up the trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost thru-hikers walk northward from Georgia to Maine, and generally start out in early spring and follow the warm weather as it moves north.[1] These \\"north-bounders\\" are also called NOBO (NOrthBOund) or GAME (Georgia(GA)-to-Maine(ME)), while those heading in the opposite direction are termed \\"south-bounders\\" (also SOBO or MEGA).[67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of hiker subculture includes making colorful entries in logbooks at trail shelters, signed using pseudonyms called \\"trail names\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Appalachian Trail Conservancy gives the name \\"2000 Miler\\" to anyone who completes the entire trail. The ATC's recognition policy for \\"2000 Milers\\" gives equal recognition to thru-hikers and section-hikers, operates on the honor system, and recognizes blue-blazed trails or officially required roadwalks as substitutes for the official, white-blazed route during an emergency such as a flood, forest fire, or impending storm on an exposed, high-elevation stretch.[69] As of 2010, more than 11,000 people had reported completing the entire trail.[70] About three-quarters of these are thru-hikers.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Appalachian Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, and the Pacific Crest Trail form what is known as the Triple Crown of long-distance hiking in the United States.[8][9] In 2001, Brian Robinson became the first one to complete all three trails in a year.[71] In 2015, Heather Anderson (trail name \\"Anish\\") became the first woman to hold the unsupported record on the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail simultaneously.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nFastest known times for self-supported attempts (meaning no vehicle or crew support, implying carrying a heavy backpack):\\r\\n\\r\\nFastest known times for supported attempts (the athletes travel light, relying on a support crew with food, shelter, medical treatment, etc.):\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 26, 2017, Dale \\"Grey Beard\\" Sanders became the oldest person to hike the entire Appalachian Trail at age 82.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trail is currently protected along more than 99% of its course by federal or state ownership of the land or by right-of-way. The trail is maintained by a variety of citizen organizations, environmental advocacy groups, governmental agencies and individuals. Annually, more than 4,000 volunteers contribute over 175,000 hours of effort on the Appalachian Trail, an effort coordinated largely by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) organization. In total, the AT passes through eight national forests and two national parks.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of its journey, the trail follows the ridge line of the Appalachian Mountains, crossing many of its highest peaks, and running, with only a few exceptions, almost continuously through wilderness. The trail used to traverse many hundreds of miles of private property; currently 99% of the trail is on public land.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nA hiker signs the register on Springer Mountain, Ga., southern terminus of the trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAppalachian Trail at Newfound Gap in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, N.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess to the Appalachian Trail at Clingmans Dome, the highest mountain in Tennessee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pocosin cabin along the trail in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgia has 75 miles (121?km) of the trail, including the southern terminus at Springer Mountain at an elevation of 3,782 feet (1,153?m).[80] At 4,461 feet (1,360?m), Blood Mountain is the highest point on the trail in Georgia. The AT and approach trail, along with many miles of blue blazed side trails, are managed and maintained by the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club. See also: Georgia Peaks on the Appalachian Trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Carolina has 95.7 miles (154.0?km) of the trail, not including more than 200 miles (320?km) along the Tennessee Border.[81] Altitude ranges from 1,725 to 5,498 feet (526 to 1,676?m). The trail enters from Georgia at Bly Gap, ascending peaks such as Standing Indian Mountain, Mt. Albert, and Wayah Bald. It then goes by Nantahala Outdoor Center at the Nantahala River Gorge and the Nantahala River crossing. Up to this point, the trail is maintained by the Nantahala Hiking Club. Beyond this point, it is maintained by the Smoky Mountains Hiking Club. 30 miles (48?km) further north, Fontana Dam marks the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nTennessee has 71 miles (114?km) of the trail,[83][84] not including more than 200 miles (320?km) along or near the North Carolina Border.[85] The section that runs just below the summit of Clingmans Dome in Great Smoky Mountains National Park is along the North Carolina and Tennessee border and is the highest point on the trail at 6,643 feet (2,025?m). The Smoky Mountains Hiking Club (Knoxville, TN) maintains the trail throughout the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to Davenport Gap. North of Davenport Gap, the Carolina Mountain Club (Asheville, NC) maintains the trail to Spivey Gap. Then the remaining Tennessee section is maintained by the Tennessee Eastman Hiking & Canoeing Club (Kingsport, TN).\\r\\n\\r\\nVirginia has 550.3 miles (885.6?km) of the trail (one-fourth of the entire trail) including more than 20 miles (32?km) along the West Virginia border.[86] With the climate, and the timing of northbound thru-hikers, this section is wet and challenging because of the spring thaw and heavy spring rainfall.[87] Substantial portions of the trail closely parallel Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park and, further south, the Blue Ridge Parkway.[86] \\r\\nThe Appalachian Trail Conservancy considers as excellent for beginning hikers a well-maintained 104 miles (167?km) section of the trail that the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed in Shenandoah National Park. Climbs in this section rarely exceed 1,000 feet (300?m).[15][86] In the southwestern portion of the state, the trail goes within one half mile of the highest point in Virginia, Mount Rogers, which is a short side-hike from the AT.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AT crosses the railroad bridge at left in this photo of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnapolis Rock Overlook, along the trail in South Mountain State Park, Maryland.\\r\\n\\r\\nPedestrian bridge over US Highway 11 in Middlesex Township, Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nSign within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in New Jersey.\\r\\n\\r\\nBear Mountain Bridge, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nWest Virginia has 4 miles (6.4?km) of the trail, not including about 20 miles (32?km) along the Virginia border.[88] Here the trail passes through the town of Harpers Ferry, headquarters of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Harpers Ferry is what many consider to be the mental midpoint of the entire A.T., although the actual midpoint is further north in southern Pennsylvania. (The exact midpoint moves due to trail rerouting.)[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaryland has 41 miles (66?km) of the trail, with elevations ranging from 230 to 1,880 feet (70 to 573?m).[90] Most of the trail runs along the ridgeline of South Mountain in South Mountain State Park.[91] Hikers are required to stay at designated shelters and campsites. The trail runs through the eastern edge of Greenbrier State Park. This can serve as a luxurious stop point for a hot shower and a visit to the camp store. The trail runs along the C&O Canal Towpath route for 3 miles (4.8?km). Hikers will also pass High Rock, which offers extensive views and is also used as a hang-gliding site.[92] The section ends at Pen Mar Park, which sits on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nPennsylvania has 229.6 miles (369.5?km) of the trail.[93] The trail extends from the Pennsylvania ÿ Maryland line at Pen Mar, a tiny town straddling the state line, to the Delaware Water Gap, at the Pennsylvania ÿ New Jersey border. The Susquehanna River is generally considered the dividing line between the northern and southern sections of the Pennsylvania AT. South of the Susquehanna, the trail passes through Pine Grove Furnace State Park. The Pennsylvania section of the trail north of the Susquehanna, from Duncannon until the Delaware Water Gap, is noted for its eroded and rocky terrain which can slow hiking.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Jersey is home to 72.2 miles (116.2?km) of the trail.[95] The trail enters New Jersey from the south on a pedestrian walkway along the Interstate 80 bridge over the Delaware River, ascends from the Delaware Water Gap to the top of Kittatinny Mountain in Worthington State Forest, passes Sunfish Pond (right), continues north through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and Stokes State Forest and eventually reaches High Point State Park, the highest peak in New Jersey (a side trail is required to reach the actual peak). It then turns in a southeastern direction along the New York border for about 30 miles (48?km), passing over long sections of boardwalk bridges over marshy land, then entering Wawayanda State Park and then the Abram S. Hewitt State Forest just before entering New York near Greenwood Lake. In New Jersey the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference maintains and updates the Appalachian Trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack bear activity along the trail in New Jersey increased rapidly starting in 2001. Hence, metal bear-proof trash boxes are in place at all New Jersey shelters.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York's 88.4 miles (142.3?km) of trail contain very little elevation change compared to other states.[96] From south to north, the trail summits many small mountains under 1,400 feet (430?m) in elevation, its highest point in New York being Prospect Rock at 1,433 feet (437?m), and only 3,000 feet (910?m) from the border with New Jersey. The trail continues north, climbing near Fitzgerald Falls, passing through Sterling Forest, and then entering Harriman State Park and Bear Mountain State Park. The lowest point on the entire Appalachian Trail is in the Bear Mountain Zoo 124 feet (38?m). It crosses the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge. It then passes through Fahnestock State Park, and continues northeast and crosses the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line. This track crossing is the site of the only train station along the trail's length. It enters Connecticut via the Pawling Nature Reserve. The section of the trail that passes through Harriman and Bear Mountain State Parks is the oldest section of the trail, completed in 1923. A portion of this section was paved by 700 volunteers with 800 granite-slab steps followed by over a mile of walkway supported by stone crib walls with boulders lining the path.[6] The project took four years, cost roughly $1 million, and was officially opened in June 2010.[6] The project was done by the New YorkÿNew Jersey Trail Conference. The New YorkÿNew Jersey Trail Conference maintains and updates the Appalachian Trail in New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nHousatonic River's Great Falls in Falls Village, Connecticut as viewed from the Appalachian Trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nView from Mount Greylock in Massachusetts\\r\\n\\r\\nFranconia Ridge, a section of the Appalachian Trail in New Hampshire\\r\\n\\r\\nNorthern terminus of the trail atop Mount Katahdin in Maine\\r\\n\\r\\nConnecticut's 52 miles (84?km) of trail lie almost entirely along the ridges to the west above the Housatonic River valley.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state line is also the western boundary of a 480 acres (190?ha) Connecticut reservation inhabited by Schaghticoke Indians. Inside it, the AT roughly parallels its northern boundary, crossing back outside it after 2,000 feet (610?m). The trail proceeds northward through the Housatonic River valley and hills to its west, veering northwesterly and, at Salisbury, ascending the southern Taconic mountains, at Lion's Head affording a view northeasterly towards Mt. Greylock and other points in Massachusetts, and at Bear Mountain, reaching over 2,000 feet (610?m) in elevation for the first time since Pennsylvania and yielding views across the Hudson River valley to the Catskills and across the broad expanse of the Housatonic valley and the Berkshire and Litchfield Hills to the east. Just north of Bear, the trail, as it crosses into Massachusetts, descends into Sages Ravine, a deep gorge in the eastern Taconic ridgeline which is home to a fragile old growth forest. As the trail crosses the brook in the ravine, it leaves the area maintained by the Connecticut section of the Appalachian Mountain Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nMassachusetts has 90 miles (140?km) of trail.[98] The entire section of trail is in western Massachusetts' Berkshire County. It summits the highest peak in the southern Taconic Range, Mount Everett (2,604 feet (794?m)), then descends to the Housatonic River valley and skirts the town of Great Barrington. The trail passes through the towns of Dalton and Cheshire, and summits the highest point in the state at 3,491 feet (1,064?m), Mount Greylock. It then quickly descends to the valley within 2 miles (3.2?km) of North Adams and Williamstown, before ascending again to the Vermont state line. The trail throughout Massachusetts is maintained by the Berkshire Chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nVermont has 150 miles (240?km) of the trail.[99] Upon entering Vermont, the trail coincides with the southernmost sections of the generally north/south-oriented Long Trail. It follows the ridge of the southern Green Mountains, summitting such notable peaks as Stratton Mountain, Glastenbury Mountain, and Killington Peak. After parting ways with the Long Trail at Maine Junction, the AT turns in a more eastward direction, crossing the White River, passing through Norwich, and entering Hanover, New Hampshire, as it crosses the Connecticut River. The Green Mountain Club maintains the AT from the Massachusetts state border to Route 12. The Dartmouth Outing Club maintains the trail from VT Route 12 to the New Hampshire state line.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Hampshire has 161 miles (259?km) of the trail.[100] The New Hampshire AT is nearly all within the White Mountain National Forest. For northbound thru-hikers, it is the beginning of the main challenges that go beyond enduring distance and time: in New Hampshire and Maine, rough or steep ground are more frequent and alpine conditions are found near summits and along ridges. The trail reaches 17 of the 48 four-thousand footers of New Hampshire, including 6,288-foot (1,917?m) Mount Washington, the highest point of the AT north of Tennessee and most topographically prominent peak in eastern North America. The trail passes within half a mile of 7 additional 4000-footer peaks in the Whites. Entering the alpine zone on the summit of Mount Pierce, from the south, the trail continues in alpine or near-alpine scrub continuously along the high Presidential ridge until descending the southeast flank of Mount Madison into the Great Gulf Wilderness over 12 miles northward. This region is subject to extremes of weather with little natural shelter and only occasional man-made shelter from the elements. Though greatest from November to May, the threat of severe and cold conditions in the Presidentials and across the New Hampshire Section is present year-round and requires hikers' careful attention to weather forecasts and planning, provisions and gear. The Dartmouth Outing Club maintains the AT from the Vermont border past Mount Moosilauke to Kinsman Notch, northwest of Woodstock, New Hampshire, Randolph Mountain Club maintains 2.2 miles from Osgood Trail near Madison Hut to Edmands Col, with the AMC maintaining the remaining miles through the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaine has 281 miles (452?km) of the trail. The northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail is on Mount Katahdin's Baxter Peak in Baxter State Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some parts of the trail in Maine, even the strongest hikers may only average 1 mile per hour (1.6?km/h), with places where hikers must hold on to tree limbs and roots to climb or descend, which is especially hazardous in wet weather.[101] The western section includes a mile-long (1.6?km) stretch of boulders, some of which hikers must pass under, at Mahoosuc Notch, sometimes called the trail's hardest mile.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there are dozens of river and stream fords on the Maine section of the trail, the Kennebec River is the only one on the trail that requires a boat crossing. The most isolated portion of the Appalachian Trail, known as the \\"Hundred-Mile Wilderness\\", occurs in Maine. It heads east-northeast from the town of Monson and ends outside Baxter State Park just south of Abol Bridge.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nPark management strongly discourages thru-hiking within the park before May 15 or after October 15.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AMC maintains the AT from the New Hampshire state line to Grafton Notch, with the Maine Appalachian Trail Club responsible for maintaining the remaining miles to Mt. Katahdin. The international extension, called the International Appalachian Trail begins at Mt. Katahdin.\\r\\n\\r\\nListed from south to north.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouthern terminus: Springer Mountain, Georgia\\r\\n\\r\\nNorthern terminus: Mount Katahdin, Maine\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Appalachian Trail Conservancy (originally, Appalachian Trail Conference) and the National Park Service oversee the entire length of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail via memorandums of understanding with other public agencies through whose land the trail runs, including the U.S. Forest Service. national parks, national forests, the Tennessee Valley Authority, state parks, and others, who help administer portions of the trail corridor. The estimated annual contribution of volunteer services for trail upkeep is $3 million.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Appalachian Trail has been a resource for researchers in a variety of disciplines. Portions of the trail in Tennessee were used on a study on trail maintenance for the trail's \\"uniform environmental conditions and design attributes and substantial gradient in visitor use.\\"[84] Beginning in 2007, various citizen groups, including the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and the American Hiking Society, began a study to monitor environmental changes that have resulted from higher ozone levels, acid rain, smog, and other air quality factors.[105] Such research has been supported by the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Cornell University, the National Geographic Society, and Aveda Corporation.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nBehavioral studies have also been conducted on hikers themselves. A 2007 study on hikers found that most persons hike the trail \\"for fun and enjoyment of life and for warm relationships with others\\" and that \\"environmental awareness, physical challenge, camaraderie, exercise, and solitude\\" were chief results among hikers.[106] Since the highest single demographic of thru-hikers are males between the ages of 18ÿ29, one informal study sought to find the correlation between this group and male college drop-outs.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial sites","input":"What is the southern end of the appalachian trail?"},{"output":"16 October 1950","context":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a fantasy novel for children by C. S. Lewis, published by Geoffrey Bles in 1950. It is the first published and best known of seven novels in The Chronicles of Narnia (1950ÿ1956). Among all the author's books it is also the most widely held in libraries.[2] Although it was written as well as published first in the series, it is volume two in recent editions, which are sequenced by the stories' chronology (the first being The Magician's Nephew). Like the others, it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes, and her work has been retained in many later editions.[1][3]\\r\\nMost of the novel is set in Narnia, a land of talking animals and mythical creatures that one White Witch has ruled for 100 years of deep winter. In the frame story, four English children are relocated to a large, old country house following a wartime evacuation. The youngest visits Narnia three times via the magic of a wardrobe in a spare room. All four children are together on her third visit, which verifies her fantastic claims and comprises the subsequent 12 of 17 chapters except for a brief conclusion. In Narnia, the siblings seem fit to fulfill an old prophecy and so are soon adventuring both to save Narnia and their lives. Lewis wrote the book for, and dedicated it to, his goddaughter Lucy Barfield. She was the daughter of Owen Barfield, Lewis's friend, teacher, adviser, and trustee.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1940, four siblings ÿ Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie ÿ are among many children evacuated from London during World War II to escape the Blitz. They are sent to the countryside to live with professor Digory Kirke. Exploring the professor's house, Lucy finds a wardrobe which doubles as a magic portal to a forest in a land called Narnia. At a lamppost oddly located in the forest, she meets Tumnus, a faun, who invites her to tea in his home. There the faun confesses that he invited her not out of hospitality, but with the intention of betraying her to the White Witch. The witch has ruled Narnia for years, using magic to keep it frozen in a perpetual winter. She has ordered all Narnians to turn in any humans (\\"Sons of Adam\\" or \\"Daughters of Eve\\") they come across. But now that he has come to know and like a human, Tumnus repents his original intention and escorts Lucy back to the lamppost.\\r\\nLucy returns through the wardrobe and finds that only a few seconds have passed in normal time during her absence. Her siblings do not believe her story about another world inside the wardrobe, which is now found to have a solid back panel.\\r\\nDuring a game of hide-and-seek on some days later, Lucy again passes into Narnia. This time her brother Edmund chances to follow her. He meets Jadis, who calls herself Queen of Narnia. When she learns that he is human and has two sisters and a brother, she places an enchantment on him. She urges him to bring his siblings to her castle, promising in return to make him her heir. When Lucy and Edmund return together through the wardrobe, Edmund realizes that the queen he met and the witch Lucy describes are one and the same. He denies to the others that he has been in Narnia at all. Peter and Susan are puzzled by Lucy's insistence, and consult the Professor, who surprises them by taking Lucy's side in the debate of Narnia's existence.\\r\\nSoon afterward, all four children enter Narnia together after hiding in the wardrobe to avoid the professor's dour housekeeper, Mrs. Macready. Remembering the winter cold ahead, they take coats from the wardrobe before exploring. Lucy guides them to Tumnus's cave, but they find it ransacked, with a notice from Jadis (the White Witch) proclaiming his arrest for harbouring humans.\\r\\nA talking beaver intercepts them, proves himself a friend, and hides the children in his den. There, he and Mrs. Beaver tell them of a prophecy that Jadis's power will fail when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve fill the four thrones at Cair Paravel. Aslan, the great lion and the rightful King, has been absent for many years but is now \\"on the move again\\" in Narnia.\\r\\nEdmund steals away to Jadis's castle, which is filled with statues of Narnian victims she has turned to stone. Jadis is furious when Edmund appears alone and angrier still to learn that Aslan may have returned. She takes him on her sledge to catch the others or to reach Aslan's court before them.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Mr Beaver realises that Edmund has betrayed them, and they set off at once to seek Aslan at the Stone Table. As they travel, the Witch's spell over Narnia begins to break: Father Christmas (who has not been seen in Narnia for a hundred years) arrives with magical presents: a sword for Peter, a horn and a bow with arrows for Susan, a knife and a bottle of healing cordial for Lucy. The snow melts, and winter ends. Aslan welcomes the children and the Beavers to his camp near the Stone Table. Upon hearing Edmund's situation, he orders a rescue party of loyal Narnians.\\r\\nAfter much hardship at the hands of the Witch and her sledge driver, Edmund is rescued from their camp and reunited with his siblings. Jadis approaches in truce to parley with Aslan. She insists that, according to \\"deep magic from the dawn of time\\", she holds the right to kill Edmund following his treason. Aslan bargains with her privately and she renounces her claim.\\r\\nThat evening, Aslan secretly returns to the Stone Table, shadowed by Susan and Lucy. Upon noticing them, Aslan welcomes their company but warns them not to interfere with what is about to happen. He has traded his own life to the witch for Edmund's, and the girls watch as Jadis oversees his shaming before her underlings. She orders Aslan tied to the Stone Table, shaved and muzzled; and she administers the killing blow herself.\\r\\nConfident now of victory, the Witch leads her army away to battle. Susan and Lucy remain weeping over Aslan's abandoned body. They un-muzzle him and see mice gnaw away his bonds. The Stone Table breaks and Aslan is restored to life. He tells Lucy and Susan that Jadis was unaware of the \\"deeper magic from before the dawn of time\\" that will resurrect an innocent killed in place of a traitor.\\r\\nAslan carries Lucy and Susan on his back as he hurries to Jadis's castle. He breathes upon the stone statues in the courtyard, restoring them to life.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Peter and Edmund lead the Narnians against Jadis, and Edmund is seriously wounded. Aslan arrives with the former statues as reinforcements. The Narnians rout Jadis's supporters, and Aslan kills Jadis. Aslan breathes life into those Jadis has turned to stone on the battlefield, and Lucy uses her magic cordial to revive the wounded, starting with Edmund. The Pevensie children are crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel. Soon afterward, Aslan slips away and disappears.\\r\\nFifteen years later, the four rulers chase a wish-granting white stag through the forest whereupon they rediscover the lamppost. They soon find their way not through branches but coats. They come back through the wardrobe in the Professor's house and are suddenly children again, dressed in their old clothes. Almost no time has passed in the real world, despite their many years in Narnia.\\r\\nThe four children consult the Professor. He forgives them the absence of the four coats they stole, and hints that theirs would prove not to be the first adventure in Narnia, nor by any means the last.\\r\\nThe Pevensie Siblings\\r\\nRaised in London, evacuated to the Dorset countryside, and reaching adulthood in Narnia, they are the four main characters. In one chapter, Father Christmas arrives to endow those present (three Pevensies and two beavers) with a feast, weapons, and magical items. After the restoration of Narnia, a Tetrarchy is established with the four siblings as the rulers.\\r\\nAt the Country Home\\r\\nThe house that shelters the Pevensie children is run by a Professor, staffed by servants, and frequently toured by historians.\\r\\nNarnians\\r\\nThe magical land of Narnia is populated by talking animals, mythological species, and sentient flora.\\r\\nLewis described the origin of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in an essay titled \\"It All Began with a Picture\\":[6]\\r\\nThe Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, I said to myself: 'Let's try to make a story about it.'\\r\\nShortly before the Second World War many children were evacuated from London to the English countryside to escape bomber attacks on London by Nazi Germany. On 2 September 1939 three school girls, Margaret, Mary and Katherine,[7][8] came to live at The Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis's home three miles east of Oxford city centre. Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September[9] he began a children's story on an odd sheet that has survived as part of another manuscript:\\r\\nThis book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, who was in the Army, had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work. They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother's who was a very old professor who lived all by himself in the country.[10]\\r\\nThe plot element of entering a new world through the back of a wardrobe had certainly entered Lewis's mind by 1946, when he used it to describe his first encounter with really good poetry:\\r\\nI did not in the least feel that I was getting in more quantity or better quality a pleasure I had already known. It was more as if a cupboard which one had hitherto valued as a place for hanging coats proved one day, when you opened the door, to lead to the garden of the Hesperides?...[11]\\r\\nHow much more of the story Lewis then wrote is uncertain. Roger Lancelyn Green thinks that he might even have completed it. In September 1947 Lewis wrote in a letter about stories for children: \\"I have tried one myself but it was, by the unanimous verdict of my friends, so bad that I destroyed it.\\"[12]\\r\\nIn August 1948, during a visit by an American writer, Chad Walsh, Lewis talked vaguely about completing a children's book he had begun \\"in the tradition of E. Nesbit\\".[13] After this conversation not much happened until the beginning of the next year. Then everything changed. In his essay \\"It All Began With a Picture\\" Lewis continues: \\"At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe major ideas of the book echo lines Lewis had written fourteen years earlier in his alliterative poem The Planets:\\r\\n...?Of wrath ended\\r\\nAnd woes mended, of winter passed\\r\\nAnd guilt forgiven, and good fortune\\r\\nJove is master; and of jocund revel,\\r\\nLaughter of ladies. The lion-hearted\\r\\n...?are Jove's children.[15]\\r\\nOn 10 March 1949 Roger Lancelyn Green dined with Lewis at Magdalen College. After the meal Lewis read two chapters from his new children's story to Green. Lewis asked Green's opinion of the tale and Green said that he thought it was good. The manuscript of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March 1949. Lucy Barfield received it by the end of May.[16] When on 16 October 1950 Geoffrey Bles in London published the first edition, three new \\"chronicles\\", Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Horse and His Boy, had also been completed.\\r\\nLewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, allowed him to choose the illustrator for the novel and the Narnia series. Lewis chose Pauline Baynes, possibly based on J. R. R. Tolkiens recommendation. Baynes had greatly impressed Tolkien with her illustrations for his Farmer Giles of Ham (1949). However, Baynes claimed that Lewis learned about her work after going into a bookshop and asking for a recommendation for an illustrator who was skilled at portraying both humans and animals. In December 1949, Bles showed Lewis the first drawings for the novel, and Lewis sent Baynes a note congratulating her, particularly on the level of detail. Lewiss appreciation of the illustrations is evident in a letter he wrote to Baynes after The Last Battle won the Carnegie Medal for best childrens book of 1956: \\"is it not rather 'our' medal? Im sure the illustrations were taken into account as well as the text\\".[17]\\r\\nThe British edition of the novel had 43 illustrations; American editions generally had fewer. The popular United States paperback edition published by Collier between 1970 and 1994, which sold many millions, had only 17 illustrations, many of them severely cropped from the originals, giving many readers in that country a very different experience when reading the novel. All the illustrations were restored for the 1994 worldwide HarperCollins edition, although these lacked the clarity of early printings.[18]\\r\\nLewis very much enjoyed writing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and embarked on the sequel Prince Caspian soon after finishing the first novel. He completed the sequel by end of 1949, less than a year after finishing the initial book. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe had few readers during 1949 and was not published until late in 1950, so his initial enthusiasm did not stem from favourable reception by the public.[19]\\r\\nWhile Lewis is known today on the strength of the Narnia stories as a highly successful childrens writer, the initial critical response was muted. At the time it was fashionable for children's stories to be realistic; fantasy and fairy tales were seen as indulgent, appropriate only for very young readers and potentially harmful to older children, even hindering their ability to relate to everyday life. Some reviewers considered the tale overtly moralistic or the Christian elements over-stated  attempts to indoctrinate children. Others were concerned that the many violent incidents might frighten children.[20]\\r\\nLewis's publisher, Geoffrey Bles, feared that the Narnia tales would not sell, and might damage Lewis reputation and affect sales of his other books. Nevertheless, the novel and its successors were highly popular with young readers, and Lewis's publisher was soon eager to release further Narnia stories.[21]\\r\\nIn the United States a 2004 study found that The Lion was a common read-aloud book for seventh-graders in schools in San Diego County, California.[22] In 2005 it was included on TIME's unranked list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923.[23] Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association named it one of \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\\".[24] In 2012 it was ranked number five among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience.[25]\\r\\nA 2012 survey by the University of Worcester determined that it was the second most common book that UK adults had read as children, after Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. (Adults, perhaps limited to parents, ranked Alice and The Lion fifth and sixth as books the next generation should read, or their children should read during their lifetimes.)[26]\\r\\nTIME magazine included the novel in its \\"All-TIME 100 Novels\\" (best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005).[23] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 9 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[27] It has also been published in 47 foreign languages.[28]\\r\\nLewis wrote that \\"The Narnian books are not as much allegory as supposal. Suppose there were a Narnian world and it, like ours, needed redemption. What kind of incarnation and Passion might Christ be supposed to undergo there?\\"[29]\\r\\nThe main story is an allegory of Christ's crucifixion:[30][31] Aslan sacrifices himself for Edmund, a traitor who may deserve death, in the same way that Christians believe Jesus sacrificed himself for sinners. Aslan is killed on the Stone Table, symbolizing Mosaic Law, which breaks when he is resurrected, symbolizing the replacement of the strict justice of Old Testament law with redeeming grace and forgiveness granted on the basis of substitutional atonement, according to Christian theology.[32] As with the Christian Passion, it is women (Susan and Lucy) who tend Aslan's body after he dies and are the first to see him after his resurrection. The significance of the death contains elements of both the ransom theory of atonement and the satisfaction theory: Aslan suffers Edmund's penalty (satisfaction), and buys him back from the White Witch, who was entitled to him by reason of his treachery (ransom). In Christian belief, Christ is associated with the Biblical \\"Lion of Judah\\" of Revelation 5:5.\\r\\nProfessor Kirke is based on W.T. Kirkpatrick, who tutored a 16-year-old Lewis. \\"Kirk,\\" as he was sometimes called, taught the young Lewis much about thinking and communicating clearly, skills that would be invaluable to him later.[33]\\r\\nNarnia is caught in endless winter that has lasted a century when the children first enter. Norse tradition mythologises a \\"great winter,\\" known as the Fimbulwinter, said to precede Ragnar?k. The trapping of Edmund by the White Witch is reminiscent of the seduction and imprisonment of Kay by The Snow Queen in Hans Christian Andersen's novella of that name.[34]\\r\\nThe dwarves and giants are found in Norse mythology; fauns, centaurs, minotaurs and dryads derive from Greek mythology. Father Christmas, of course, was part of popular English folklore.\\r\\nThere are several parallels between the White Witch and the immortal white queen, Ayesha, of H. Rider Haggard's She, a novel greatly admired by C.S. Lewis.[35]\\r\\nThe Story of the Amulet written by Edith Nesbit also contains scenes that can be considered precursors to sequences presenting Jadis, particularly in The Magician's Nephew.[36] Nesbit's short story The Aunt and Amabel includes the motif of a girl entering a wardrobe to gain access to a magical place.[37]\\r\\nThe freeing of Aslan's body from the stone table by field mice is reminiscent of Aesop's fable of \\"The Lion and the Mouse.\\" In the fable, a lion catches a mouse, but the mouse persuades the lion to release him, promising that the favor would be rewarded. Later in the story, he gnaws through the lion's bonds after he has been captured by hunters. It is also reminiscent of a scene from Edgar Allan Poe's story \\"The Pit and the Pendulum,\\" in which a prisoner is freed when rats gnaw through his bonds.[38] In a later book, \\"Prince Caspian,\\" we learn that as reward for their actions, mice gained the same intelligence and speech as other Narnian animals.[39]\\r\\nDue to labor union rules,[40] the text of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was reset for the publication of the first American edition of by Macmillan US in 1950.[1] Lewis took that opportunity to make the following changes to the original British edition published by Geoffrey Bles[3] earlier that same year:\\r\\nWhen HarperCollins took over publication of the series in 1994, they began using the original British edition for all subsequent English editions worldwide.[46] The current US edition published by Scholastic has 36,135 words.[47]\\r\\nThe story has been adapted three times for television. The first adaptation was a ten-part serial produced by ABC Weekend Television for ITV and broadcast in 1967. In 1979, an animated TV-movie,[48] directed by Peanuts director Bill Melndez, was broadcast and won the first Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. A third television adaptation was produced in 1988 by the BBC using a combination of live actors, animatronic puppets and animation. Only this last one was the first of a series of 3 Narnia adaptations. The programme was nominated for an Emmy and won a BAFTA. It was followed by three further Narnia adaptations.\\r\\nStage adaptations include a 1984 version staged at London's Westminster Theatre, produced by Vanessa Ford Productions. The play, adapted by Glyn Robbins, was directed by Richard Williams and designed by Marty Flood.[49] Jules Tasca, Ted Drachman, and Thomas Tierney collaborated on a musical adaptation published in 1986.[50]\\r\\nIn 1997, Trumpets Inc., a Filipino Christian theatre and musical production company, produced a musical rendition that Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson (and co-producer of the Walden Media film adaptations), has openly declared that he feels is the closest to Lewis's intention.[51][52][53] It starred among others popular young Filipino singer Sam Concepcion as Edmund Pevensie.[54] The book and lyrics were written by Jaime del Mundo and Luna Inocian, while music was composed by Lito Villareal.\\r\\nIn 1998, the Royal Shakespeare Company did an adaptation by Adrian Mitchell, for which the acting edition has been published.[55] The Stratford Festival in Canada mounted a new production of Mitchell's work in June 2016. [2] [3]\\r\\nIn 2003, there was an Australian commercial stage production which toured the country by Malcolm C. Cooke Productions, using both life-size puppets and human actors. It was directed by notable film director Nadia Tass, and starred Amanda Muggleton, Dennis Olsen, Meaghan Davies and Yolande Brown.[56][57]\\r\\nIn 2011, a two-actor stage adaptation by Le Clanch du Rand opened Off-Broadway in New York City at St. Luke's Theatre. The production was directed by Julia Beardsley O'Brien and starred Erin Layton and Andrew Fortman.[58] As of 2014, the production is currently running with a replacement cast of Abigail Taylor-Sansom and Rockford Sansom.[59]\\r\\nMultiple audio editions have been released, both straightforward readings and dramatizations.\\r\\nIn 1981, Michael Hordern read abridged versions of the classic tale (and the others in the series). In 2000, an unabridged audio book was released, narrated by Michael York. (All the books were released in audio form, read by different actors.)\\r\\nIn 1988, BBC Radio 4 mounted a full dramatization. In 1998, Focus on the Family Radio Theatre also adapted this story. Both the original BBC version and the Focus on the Family version have been broadcast on BBC radio. Both are the first in a series of adaptations of all seven of the Narnia books. The BBC series uses the title Tales of Narnia, while the Focus on the Family version uses the more familiar Chronicles moniker. The Focus on the Family version is also longer, with a full orchestra score, narration, a larger cast of actors, and introductions by Douglas Gresham, C.S. Lewis' stepson.\\r\\nIn 2005, the story was adapted for a theatrical film, co-produced by Walt Disney and Walden Media. It has so far been followed by two more films: The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The latter was co-produced by Twentieth-Century Fox and Walden Media.","input":"When was the lion the witch and the wardrobe first published?"},{"output":"freshwater","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Ontario is one of the five Great Lakes of North America. It is surrounded on the north, west, and southwest by the Canadian province of Ontario, and on the south and east by the American state of New York, whose water boundaries meet in the middle of the lake. Ontario, Canada's most populous province, was named for the lake. Many of Ontario's most populous cities, including Toronto, Canada's most populous city, and Hamilton, are on the lake's northern or western shores. In the Huron language, the name Ontar'io means \\"Lake of Shining Waters\\". Its primary inlet is the Niagara River from Lake Erie.  The last in the Great Lakes chain, Lake Ontario serves as the outlet to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence River.\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Ontario is the easternmost of the Great Lakes and the smallest in surface area (7,340?sq?mi, 18,960?km2),[1] although it exceeds Lake Erie in volume (393 cu?mi, 1,639?km3). It is the 14th largest lake in the world.  When its islands are included, the lake has a shoreline that is 712 miles (1,146?km) long. As the last lake in the Great Lakes' hydrologic chain, Lake Ontario has the lowest mean surface elevation of the lakes at 243 feet (74?m)[2] above sea level; 326 feet (99?m) lower than its neighbor upstream. Its maximum length is 193 statute miles (311 kilometres; 168 nautical miles) and its maximum width is 53 statute miles (85?km; 46?nmi).[2] The lake's average depth is 47 fathoms 1 foot (283?ft; 86 m), with a maximum depth of 133 fathoms 4 feet (802?ft; 244 m).[2][3] The lake's primary source is the Niagara River, draining Lake Erie, with the St. Lawrence River serving as the outlet. The drainage basin covers 24,720?square?miles (64,030?km2).[1][5] As with all the Great Lakes, water levels change both within the year (owing to seasonal changes in water input) and among years (owing to longer term trends in precipitation).  These water level fluctuations are an integral part of lake ecology, and produce and maintain extensive wetlands.[6][7]  The lake also has an important freshwater fishery, although it has been negatively affected by factors including over-fishing, water pollution and invasive species.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBaymouth bars built by prevailing winds and currents have created a significant number of lagoons and sheltered harbors, mostly near (but not limited to) Prince Edward County, Ontario and the easternmost shores. Perhaps the best-known example is Toronto Bay, chosen as the site of the Upper Canada (Ontario) capital for its strategic harbour. Other prominent examples include Hamilton Harbour, Irondequoit Bay, Presqu'ile Bay, and Sodus Bay. The bars themselves are the sites of long beaches, such as Sandbanks Provincial Park and Sandy Island Beach State Park. These sand bars are often associated with large wetlands, which support large numbers of plant and animal species, as well as providing important rest areas for migratory birds.[9][10] Presqu'ile, on the north shore of Lake Ontario, is particularly significant in this regard. One unique feature of the lake is the Z-shaped Bay of Quinte which separates Prince Edward County from the Ontario mainland, save for a 2-mile (3.2?km) isthmus near Trenton; this feature also supports many wetlands and aquatic plants, as well as associated fisheries.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor rivers draining into Lake Ontario include the Niagara River, Don River, Humber River, Trent River, Cataraqui River, Genesee River, Oswego River, Black River, Little Salmon River, and the Salmon River.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lake basin was carved out of soft, weak Silurian-age rocks by the Wisconsin ice sheet during the last ice age. The action of the ice occurred along the pre-glacial Ontarian River valley which had approximately the same orientation as today's basin. Material that was pushed southward by the ice sheet left landforms such as drumlins, kames, and moraines, both on the modern land surface and the lake bottom,[15] reorganizing the region's entire drainage system. As the ice sheet retreated toward the north, it still dammed the St. Lawrence valley outlet, so that the lake surface was at a higher level. This stage is known as Lake Iroquois. During that time the lake drained through present-day Syracuse, New York into the Mohawk River, thence to the Hudson River and the Atlantic. The shoreline created during this stage can be easily recognized by the (now dry) beaches and wave-cut hills 10 to 25 miles (15 to 40?km) from the present shoreline.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ice finally receded from the St. Lawrence valley, the outlet was below sea level, and for a short time the lake became a bay of the Atlantic Ocean, in association with the Champlain Sea. Gradually the land rebounded from the release of the weight of about 6,500 feet (2,000?m) of ice that had been stacked on it. It is still rebounding about 12?inches (30?cm) per century in the St. Lawrence area. Since the ice receded from the area last, the most rapid rebound still occurs there. This means that the lake bed is gradually tilting southward, inundating the south shore and turning river valleys into bays. Both north and south shores experience shoreline erosion, but the tilting amplifies this effect on the south shore, causing loss to property owners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Ontario is derived from the Huron word Ontar'io, which means \\"great lake\\". The lake was a border between the Huron people and the Iroquois Confederacy in the pre-Columbian era. In the 1600s, the Iroquois drove out the Huron from southern Ontario and settled the northern shores of Lake Ontario. When the Iroquois withdrew and the Anishnabeg / Ojibwa / Mississaugas moved in from the north to southern Ontario, they retained the Iroquois name.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is believed that the first European to reach the lake was tienne Br?l in 1615. As was their practice, the French explorers introduced other names for the lake. In 1632 and 1656, the lake was referred to as Lac de St. Louis or Lake St. Louis by Samuel de Champlain and cartographer Nicolas Sanson respectively (likely for Louis XIV of France)[17] In 1660 Jesuit historian Francis Creuxius coined the name Lacus Ontarius.  In a map drawn in the Relation des Jsuites (1662ÿ1663), the lake bears the legend \\"Lac Ontario ou des Iroquois\\" with the name \\"Ondiara\\" in smaller type. A French map produced in 1712 (currently in the Canadian Museum of History[18]), created by military engineer Jean-Baptiste de Couagne, identified Lake Ontario as \\"Lac Frontenac\\" named after Louis de Buade, Comte de Frontenac et de Palluau. He was a French soldier, courtier, and Governor General of New France from 1672 to 1682 and from 1689 to his death in 1698.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtifacts which are believed to be of Norse origin have been found in the area of Sodus Bay, indicating the possibility of trading by the indigenous peoples with Norse explorers on the east coast of North America.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nA series of trading posts were established by both the British and French, such as Fort Frontenac (Kingston) in 1673, Fort Oswego in 1722, Fort Rouill (Toronto) in 1750. After the French and Indian War, all forts around the lake were under British control. The United States did not take possession of forts on present-day American territory until the signing of the Jay Treaty in 1794. Permanent, non-military European settlement began during the American Revolution. As the easternmost and nearest lake to the Atlantic seaboard of Canada and the United States, population centres here are among the oldest in the Great Lakes basin, with Kingston, Ontario, formerly the capital of Canada, dating to the 1670s (Fort Frontenac). The lake became a hub of commercial activity following the War of 1812 with canal building on both sides of the border and heavy travel by lake steamers. Steamer activity peaked in the mid-19th century before competition from railway lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a type of scow known as a stone hooker was in operation on the north-west shore, particularly around Port Credit and Bronte. Stonehooking was the practice of raking flat fragments of Dundas shale from the shallow lake floor of the area for use in construction, particularly in the growing city of Toronto.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Lakes watershed is a region of high biodiversity, and Lake Ontario is important for its diversity of birds, fish, reptiles amphibians and plants.  Many of these special species are associated with shorelines, particularly sand dunes, lagoons, and wetlands. The importance of wetlands to the lake has been appreciated, and many of the larger wetlands have protected status.  However, these wetlands are changing in part because the natural water level fluctuations have been reduced.  Many wetland plants are dependent upon low water levels to reproduce.[21] When water levels are stabilized, the area and diversity of the marsh is reduced.  This is particularly true of meadow marsh (also known as wet meadow wetlands); for example, in Eel Bay near Alexandria Bay, regulation of lake levels has resulted in large losses of wet meadow.[22]  Often this is accompanied by the invasion of cattails, which displace many of the native plant species and reduce plant diversity. Eutrophication may accelerate this process by providing nitrogen and phosphorus for the more rapid growth of competitively dominant plants.[23] Similar effects are occurring on the north shore, in wetlands such as Presqu'ile, which have interdunal wetlands called pannes, with high plant diversity and many unusual plant species.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the forests around the lake are deciduous forests dominated by trees including maple, oak, beech, ash and basswood.  These are classified as part of the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone by Environment Canada, or as the Eastern Great Lakes and Hudson Lowlands by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or as the Great Lakes Ecoregion by The Nature Conservancy.[25] Deforestation in the vicinity of the lake has had many negative impacts,[26] including loss of forest birds, extinction of native salmon, and increased amounts of sediment flowing into the lake. In some areas more than 90 percent of the forest cover has been removed and replaced by agriculture.  Certain tree species, such as hemlock, have also been particularly depleted by past logging activity.[27] Guidelines for restoration stress the importance of maintaining and restoring forest cover, particularly along streams and wetlands.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe open water is less-affected by shoreline features, such as wetlands, and more affected by nutrient levels that control the production of algae.  Algae are the basis of the open water food web, and the source of primary production that ends up as Lake Trout and Walleye at the top of the open water food web.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the other Great Lakes, Lake Ontario used to have an important commercial fishery. It has been largely destroyed, mostly by over-fishing.  Consider the Lake Sturgeon as but one example. Lake sturgeon are huge fishthey can grow up to three meters long and exceed 190?kg in weight.  The females mature slowly and require decades to reach sexual maturity. It was once an abundant species in Lake Ontario. \\"In 1860, this species, taken on incidental catches of other fishes, was killed and dumped back in the lake, piled up on shore to dry and be burned, fed to pigs, or dug into the earth as fertilizer.\\"[30] It was even stacked like cordwood and used to fuel steamboats.  Once its value was realized, \\"They were taken by every available means from spearing and jigging to set lines of baited or unbaited hooks laid on the bottom to trapnets, poundnets and gillnets.\\"[30] Over 5 million pounds were taken from adjoining Lake Erie in a single year. The fishery collapsed, largely by 1900. They have never recovered. Like most sturgeons, the lake sturgeon is rare now, and is protected in many areas. Populations in the Oswego River are being actively managed for recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis food web has been damaged not only by over-fishing, and changes in nutrient levels, but also by other types of pollution from industrial chemicals, agricultural fertilizers, untreated sewage, phosphates from laundry detergents, and pesticides. Some pollutant chemicals that have been found in the lake include DDT, benzo[a]pyrene and other pesticides; PCBs, aramite, chromium, lead, mirex, mercury, and carbon tetrachloride. The International Joint Commission has identified areas where pollution is particularly intense (point sources) and mapped them as Areas of Concern.  A Remedial Action Plan has been developed for each area.  Some Lake Ontario areas of concern include the Oswego River and Rochester Embayment on the American side, and Hamilton Harbour and Toronto on the Canadian side.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1960s and 1970s, the increased pollution caused frequent algal blooms to occur in the summer.[8] These blooms killed large numbers of fish, and left decomposing piles of filamentous algae and dead fish along the shores.[31] At times the blooms became so thick that waves could not break. Fish eating birds such as osprey, bald eagle and cormorant were being poisoned by contaminated fish. Since the 1960s and 1970s, environmental concerns have forced a cleanup of industrial and municipal wastes. Cleanup has been accomplished through better treatment plants, tighter environmental regulations, deindustrialization and increased public awareness.  Today, Lake Ontario has recovered some of its pristine quality; for example, walleye, a fish species considered as a marker of clean water, are now found. However, regional airshed pollution remains a concern. The lake has also become an important sport fishery, although with introduced species (Coho and Chinook salmon) rather than the native species. Bald eagle and osprey populations are also beginning to recover.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvasive species are a problem for Lake Ontario, particularly lamprey and zebra mussels. Lamprey are being controlled by poisoning in the juvenile stage in the streams where they breed. Zebra mussels in particular are difficult to control, and pose major challenges for the lake and its waterways.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lake has a natural seiche rhythm of eleven minutes. The seiche effect normally is only about ?3?4 inches (2?cm) but can be greatly amplified by earth movement, winds, and atmospheric pressure changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of its great depth, the lake as a whole never freezes in winter, but an ice sheet covering between 10% and 90% of the lake area typically develops, depending on the severity of the winter. Ice sheets typically form along the shoreline and in slack water bays, where the lake is not as deep. During the winters of 1877 and 1878, the ice sheet coverage was up to 95ÿ100% in most of the lake. In the winter of 1812, the ice cover was stable enough that the American naval commander stationed at Sackets Harbor feared a British attack from Kingston, over the ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the cold winds of winter pass over the warmer water of the lake, they pick up moisture and drop it as lake effect snow. Since the prevailing winter winds are from the northwest, the southern and southeastern shoreline of the lake is referred to as the snowbelt. In some winters the area between Oswego and Pulaski may receive twenty or more feet (600?cm) of snowfall. Also impacted by lake-effect snow is the Tug Hill Plateau, an area of elevated land that is about 20 miles (32?km) east of Lake Ontario, creating ideal conditions for lake-effect snowfall. The \\"Hill\\", as it is often referred to, typically receives more snow than any other region in the eastern United States. As a result, Tug Hill is a popular location for winter enthusiasts, such as snow-mobilers and cross-country skiers. Lake-effect snow often extends inland as far as Syracuse, with that city often recording the most winter snowfall accumulation of any large city in the United States. Other cities in the world receive more snow annually, such as Quebec City, which averages 135 inches (340?cm), and Sapporo, Japan, which receives 250 inches (640?cm) each year and is often regarded as the snowiest city in the world.\\r\\nFoggy conditions (particularly in fall) can be created by thermal contrasts and can be an impediment for recreational boaters. In a normal winter, Lake Ontario will be at most one quarter ice-covered, in a mild winter almost completely unfrozen. Lake Ontario has completely frozen over on five recorded occasions: from about January 20 to about March 20, 1830;[32] in 1874;[33] in 1893;[33] in 1912;[33] and in February 1934.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nLake breezes in spring tend to retard fruit bloom until the frost danger is past, and in the autumn delay the onset of fall frost, particularly on the south shore. Cool onshore winds also retard early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season, protecting them from possible frost damage. Such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate, with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area. Apples, cherries, pears, plums, and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around Rochester. Between Stoney Creek and Niagara-on-the-Lake on the Niagara Peninsula is a major fruit-growing and wine-making area. The wine-growing region extends over the international border into Niagara and Orleans counties. Apple varieties that tolerate a more extreme climate are grown on the lake's north shore, around Cobourg.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large conurbation called the Golden Horseshoe occupies the lake's westernmost shores, anchored by the cities of Toronto and Hamilton. Ports on the Canadian side include St. Catharines, Oshawa, Cobourg and Kingston, near the St. Lawrence River outlet. Close to 9 million people or over a quarter of Canada's population lives within the watershed of Lake Ontario. The American shore is largely rural, with the exception of Rochester and the much smaller ports at Oswego and Sackets Harbor. The city of Syracuse is 40 miles (64?km) inland, connected to the lake by the New York State Canal System. Over 2 million people live in Lake Ontario's American watershed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA high-speed passenger/vehicle ferry, the Spirit of Ontario I, operated between Toronto and Rochester from June 17, 2004, to January 10, 2006, when the service was cancelled. The Crystal Lynn II, out of Irondequoit, New York, has been operating between Irondequoit Bay and Henderson, New York since May 2000, operated by Capt. Bob Tein.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Lakes Waterway connects the lake sidestream to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence Seaway, and upstream to the other rivers in the chain via the Welland Canal and to Lake Erie. The Trent-Severn Waterway for pleasure boats connects Lake Ontario at the Bay of Quinte to Georgian Bay (Lake Huron), via Lake Simcoe. The Oswego Canal connects the lake at Oswego to the New York State Canal System, with outlets to the Hudson River, Lake Erie, and Lake Champlain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rideau Canal, also for pleasure boats, connects Lake Ontario at Kingston to the Ottawa River in downtown Ottawa, Ontario.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all of Lake Ontario's islands are located on the eastern and north-eastern shores, between the Prince Edward County headland and the lake's outlet at Kingston. The Toronto Islands on the north-western shore are the remnants of a sand spit formed by coastal erosion, whereas the mostly larger eastern islands are underlain by the basement rock found throughout the region. The largest island, is Wolfe Island, at the east end of the lake. It is accessible by ferry from both Canada and the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Lakes Circle Tour and Seaway Trail are designated scenic road systems connecting all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[34] As the Seaway Trail is posted on the U.S. side only, Lake Ontario is the only of the five Great Lakes to have no posted bi-national circle tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1800s, there were reports of an alleged creature, similar to the so-called Loch Ness Monster, being sighted in the lake. The creature is described as large with a long neck, green in colour, and generally causes a break in the surface waves.[35][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2012[update], nearly 50 people have successfully swum across the lake.[38] The first person who accomplished the feat was Marilyn Bell, who did it in 1954 at the age of 16. Toronto's Marilyn Bell Park is named in her honour.  The park opened in 1984, and is located just to the east of the spot where Bell completed her swim.[39] In 1974, Diana Nyad became the first person who swam across the lake against the current (from north to south).[40] On August 28, 2007, 14-year-old Natalie Lambert from Kingston, Ontario, made the swim, leaving Sackets Harbor, New York, and reaching Kingston's Confederation basin less than 24 hours after she entered the lake.[41] On August 19, 2012, 14-year-old Annaleise Carr became the youngest person to swim across the lake.  She completed the 32-mile (52-km) crossing from Niagara-on-the-Lake to Marilyn Bell Park in just under 27 hours.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government of Ontario, which holds the lakebed rights of the Canadian portion of the lake under the Beds of Navigable Waters Act,[43] currently does not permit off-shore wind power to be generated offshore.[44] In Trillium Power Wind Corporation v.

Because few coins were minted in the thirteen colonies that became the United States, foreign coins like the Spanish dollar were widely circulated. Colonial governments sometimes issued paper money to facilitate economic activities. The British Parliament passed Currency Acts in 1751, 1764, and 1773 that regulated colonial paper money.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the American Revolution, the colonies became independent states. Freed from British monetary regulations, they issued paper money to pay for military expenses. The Continental Congress also issued paper money during the Revolution, known as Continental currency, to fund the war effort. Both state and Continental currency depreciated rapidly, becoming practically worthless by the end of the war. This depreciation was caused by the government printing large amounts of currency in order to meet the demands of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were three general types of money in the colonies of British America: specie (coins), paper money and commodity money.[1] Commodity money was used when cash (coins and paper money) was scarce. Commodities such as tobacco, beaver skins, and wampum served as money at various times and places.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nCash in the colonies was denominated in pounds, shillings, and pence.[2] The value varied from colony to colony; a Massachusetts pound, for example, was not equivalent to a Pennsylvania pound. All colonial pounds were of less value than the British pound sterling.[2] The coins in circulation in the colonies were most often of Spanish and Portuguese origin.[2] The prevalence of the Spanish dollar in the colonies led to the money of the United States being denominated in dollars rather than pounds.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne by one, colonies began to issue their own paper money to serve as a convenient medium of exchange. In 1690, the Province of Massachusetts Bay created \\"the first authorized paper money issued by any government in the Western World.\\"[3] This paper money was issued to pay for a military expedition during King William's War. Other colonies followed the example of Massachusetts Bay by issuing their own paper currency in subsequent military conflicts.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe paper bills issued by the colonies were known as \\"bills of credit.\\" Bills of credit were usually fiat money: they could not be exchanged for a fixed amount of gold or silver coins upon demand.[2][4] Bills of credit were usually issued by colonial governments to pay debts. The governments would then retire the currency by accepting the bills for payment of taxes. When colonial governments issued too many bills of credit or failed to tax them out of circulation, inflation resulted. This happened especially in New England and the southern colonies, which, unlike the Middle Colonies, were frequently at war.[4]  Pennsylvania, however, was responsible in not issuing too much currency and it remains a prime example in history as a successful government-managed monetary system.  Pennsylvania's paper currency, secured by land, was said to have generally maintained its value against gold from 1723 until the Revolution broke out in 1775.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis depreciation of colonial currency was harmful to creditors in Great Britain when colonists paid their debts with money that had lost value. The British Parliament passed several Currency Acts to regulate the paper money issued by the colonies. The Currency Act of 1751 restricted the emission of paper money in New England. It allowed the existing bills to be used as legal tender for public debts (i.e. paying taxes), but disallowed their use for private debts (e.g. for paying merchants).[5] In 1776, British (Scot) economist Adam Smith criticized colonial bills of credit in his most famous work, The Wealth of Nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Currency Act, in 1764, extended the restrictions to the colonies south of New England.\\r\\nUnlike the earlier act, this act did not prohibit the colonies in question from issuing paper money but it forbade them to designate their currency as legal tender for public or private debts. That prohibition created tension between the colonies and the mother country and has sometimes been seen as a contributing factor in the coming of the American Revolution. After much lobbying, Parliament amended the act in 1773, permitting the colonies to issue paper currency as legal tender for public debts.[6] Shortly thereafter, some colonies once again began issuing paper money. When the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, all of the rebel colonies, soon to be independent states, issued paper money to pay for military expenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thirteen Colony set of colonial currency below is from the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution. Examples were selected based on the notability of the signers, followed by issue date and condition. The initial selection criteria for notability was drawn from a list[7] of currency signers who were also known to have signed the United States Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation, the United States Constitution, or attended the Stamp Act Congress.[nb 1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, the Continental Congress began issuing paper money known as Continental currency, or Continentals. Continental currency was denominated in dollars from $?1?6 to $80, including many odd denominations in between. During the Revolution, Congress issued $241,552,780 in Continental currency.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nContinental currency depreciated badly during the war, giving rise to the famous phrase \\"not worth a continental\\".[47] A primary problem was that monetary policy was not coordinated between Congress and the states, which continued to issue bills of credit.[48] \\"Some think that the rebel bills depreciated because people lost confidence in them or because they were not backed by tangible assets,\\" writes financial historian Robert E. Wright. \\"Not so. There were simply too many of them.\\"[49] Congress and the states lacked the will or the means to retire the bills from circulation through taxation or the sale of bonds.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother problem was that the British successfully waged economic warfare by counterfeiting Continentals on a large scale. Benjamin Franklin later wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artists they employed performed so well that immense quantities of these counterfeits which issued from the British government in New York, were circulated among the inhabitants of all the states, before the fraud was detected. This operated significantly in depreciating the whole mass.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of 1778, Continentals retained from ?1?5 to ?1?7 of their face value. By 1780, the bills were worth ?1?40 of their face value. Congress attempted to reform the currency by removing the old bills from circulation and issuing new ones, without success. By May 1781, Continentals had become so worthless that they ceased to circulate as money. Franklin noted that the depreciation of the currency had, in effect, acted as a tax to pay for the war.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this reason, some Quakers, whose pacifism did not permit them to pay war taxes, also refused to use Continentals, and at least one Yearly Meeting formally forbade its members to use the notes.[53] In the 1790s, after the ratification of the United States Constitution, Continentals could be exchanged for treasury bonds at 1% of face value.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the collapse of Continental currency, Congress appointed Robert Morris to be Superintendent of Finance of the United States. Morris advocated the creation of the first financial institution chartered by the United States, the Bank of North America, in 1782. The bank was funded in part by specie loaned to the United States by France. Morris helped finance the final stages of the war by issuing notes in his name, backed by his own money. The Bank of North America also issued notes convertible into specie.[55] Morris also presided over the creation of the first mint operated by the U.S. government, which struck the first coins of the United States, the Nova Constellatio patterns of 1783.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe painful experience of the runaway inflation and collapse of the Continental dollar prompted the delegates to the Constitutional Convention to include the gold and silver clause into the United States Constitution so that the individual states could not issue bills of credit or \\"make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.\\"[57] This restriction of bills of credit was extended to the Federal government, as the power to \\"emit bills\\" from the Articles of Confederation was abolished, leaving Congress with the power \\"to borrow money on credit\\".[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese references have been removed from EH.Net ---\\r\\n\\r\\nFlynn, David. \\"Credit in the Colonial American Economy\\".

Originally starting out as an effort to revise The Living Bible, the project evolved into a new English translation from Hebrew and Greek texts. Some stylistic influences of The Living Bible remained in the first edition (1996), but these are less evident in the second and third editions (2004, 2007). As of March 2014, the Christian Booksellers Association ranks the NLT as the second most popular English version of the Bible based on unit sales.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Living Translation used translators from a variety of denominations. The method combined an attempt to translate the original texts simply and literally with a dynamic equivalence synergy approach used to convey the thoughts behind the text where a literal translation may have been difficult to understand or even misleading to modern readers. A part of the reason behind adapting the language for accessibility is the premise that more people will hear the Bible read aloud in a church service than are likely to read it or study it on their own.[4]\\r\\nIt has been suggested that this \\"thought-for-thought\\" methodology, while making the translation easier to understand, is less accurate than a literal (formal equivalence) method, and thus the New Living Translation may not be suitable for those wishing to undertake detailed study of the Bible.[5]\\r\\nThe Old Testament translation was based on the Masoretic Text (Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia) and was further compared to other sources such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, Septuagint, Greek manuscripts, Samaritan Pentateuch, Syriac Peshitta, and Latin Vulgate. The New Testament translation was based on the two standard editions of the Greek New Testament (the UBS 4th revised edition and the Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece 27th edition).\\r\\nWork on this revision began in 1989 with ninety translators and published in July 1996; 25 years after the publication of The Living Bible. Advanced reader copies of the book of Romans were originally printed as the New Living Version, but eventually renamed the New Living Translation to avoid confusion between this new work and The Living Bible. NLV is still used to identify the New Living Translation in ONIX for Books. Soon after that, a new revision was begun and The Second Edition of the NLT (also called the NLTse) was released in 2004.[6] A revision in 2007 comprised mostly minor textual or footnote changes.[7] Other revisions were released in 2013 and 2015 with minor changes throughout.\\r\\nIn 2016, Tyndale House Publishers, Conference of Catholic Bishops of India Commission for Bible, ATC Publishers Bengaluru, and twelve Biblical scholars collaborated to prepare a New Living Translation Catholic Edition.[8]\\r\\nThe New Living Translation is (according to its publisher) intended to be easily accessible to readers of modern English. As part of this effort:[4]\\r\\nwith a note that the Greek text reads \\"Two hundred denarii would not be enough\\" and an explanation that a denarius was equivalent to a laborers full days wage.\\r\\nIn July 2008, the NLT gained the No.?1 spot in unit sales, unseating the NIV for the first time in over two decades.[9] According to the Christian Booksellers Association (as of March 2014), the NLT is the second most popular Bible translation based on unit sales, and the fourth most popular based on sales numbers.[3]\\r\\nA Roman Catholic edition of the NLT with the Deuterocanon has been published by ATC Publications in Bangalore, India. The NLT Catholic Edition (NLTCE) has been granted an imprimatur by Oswald Cardinal Gracias, Archbishop of Bombay and President of the Council of Catholic Bishops of India.[10] The imprimatur does not extend to use of the NLTCE in the liturgy, but it has been officially approved by the Roman Catholic Church for private study.[11]\\r\\nThe NLT is available in numerous editions as well as numerous study Bible editions, including: The Life Application Study Bible, The Discover God Study Bible, The NLT Study Bible, and the NLT Illustrated Study Bible. The Cornerstone Biblical Commentary series uses the second edition NLT text as its base. In June 2017, the Africa Study Bible was offered to African English readers being edited by Africa International University dean, John Jusu.[12]","input":"When was the new living translation bible written?"},{"output":"officially opened on 13 July 1870","context":"The London sewerage system is part of the water infrastructure serving London, England. The modern system was developed during the late 19th century, and as London has grown the system has been expanded. It is currently owned and operated by Thames Water and serves almost all of Greater London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the early 19th century the River Thames was an open sewer, with disastrous consequences for public health in London, including cholera epidemics. These were caused by enterotoxin-producing strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Although the contamination of the water supply was correctly diagnosed by Dr John Snow in 1849 as the method of communication, it was believed that miasma, or bad air, was responsible right up to the outbreak of 1866.[1] Proposals to modernise the sewerage system had been made during 1856, but were neglected due to lack of funds. However, after the Great Stink of 1858, Parliament realised the urgency of the problem and resolved to create a modern sewerage system.[2]\\r\\nJoseph Bazalgette, a civil engineer and Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Board of Works, was given responsibility for the work. He designed an extensive underground sewerage system that diverted waste to the Thames Estuary, downstream of the main centre of population. Six main interceptor sewers, totalling almost 160?km (100?miles) in length, were constructed, some incorporating stretches of London's \\"lost\\" rivers. Three of these sewers were north of the river, the southernmost, low-level one being incorporated in the Thames Embankment. The Embankment also allowed new roads, new public gardens, and the Circle line of the London Underground. Victoria Embankment was finally officially opened on 13 July 1870.[3][4]\\r\\nThe intercepting sewers, constructed between 1859 and 1865, were fed by 450?miles (720?km) of main sewers that, in turn, conveyed the contents of some 13,000?miles (21,000?km) of smaller local sewers. Construction of the interceptor system required 318?million bricks, 2.7?million cubic metres of excavated earth and 670,000 cubic metres of concrete.[5] The innovative use of Portland cement strengthened the tunnels, which were in good order 150?years later.[6]\\r\\nGravity allows the sewage to flow eastwards, but in places such as Chelsea, Deptford and Abbey Mills, pumping stations were built to raise the water and provide sufficient flow. Sewers north of the Thames feed into the Northern Outfall Sewer, which feeds into a major treatment works at Beckton. South of the river, the Southern Outfall Sewer extends to a similar facility at Crossness.\\r\\nDuring the 20th century, major improvements were made to the sewerage system and to the sewage treatment provision to substantially reduce pollution of the Thames Estuary and the North Sea.\\r\\nThe original system was designed to cope with 6.5?mm (1/4\\") per hour of rainfall within the catchment area, and supported a smaller population than today's. London's growth has put pressure on the capacity of the sewerage system. During storms, for example, high levels of rainfall (in excess of 6?mm per hour) in a short period of time can overwhelm the system. Sewers and treatment works are unable to cope with the large volumes of rainwater entering the system. Rainwater mixes with sewage in combined sewers and excess mixed water is discharged into the Thames. If this does not happen quickly enough, localised flooding occurs (surcharge). Such sanitary sewer overflow can mean streets becoming flooded with a mixture of water and sewage, causing a health risk.\\r\\nIn redeveloping the Isle of Dogs and Royal Docks areas of east London during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the London Docklands Development Corporation invested in major new drainage infrastructure to manage future sewage and surface water run-off from proposed developments. Consulting engineer Sir William Halcrow & Partners designed a system of large diameter tunnels served by new pumping stations. In the Royal Docks, approximately 16 miles (25?km) of foul and surface water drains were built, plus pumping stations at Tidal Basin (designed by Richard Rogers Partnership) and North Woolwich (architect: Nicholas Grimshaw).[7] The Isle of Dogs drainage network is served by a stormwater pumping station situated in Stewart Street, designed by John Outram Associates.[8]\\r\\nIncreasing the carrying capacity of London's sewerage system has been debated for some years. Proposals for the 'Thames Tideway' include a wide diameter storage-and-transfer tunnel (internal diameters of 7.2 m and 9 m have been suggested), 22 miles (35?km) long, underneath the riverbed of the Thames between Hammersmith in the west and Beckton/Crossness in the east,[9] but as the cost of such a megaproject is likely to be substantial (estimated at S1.7 billion in 2004), investment decisions have been slow in forthcoming. In March 2007 the Mayor of London announced that the project will proceed with completion expected by 2020.[10]\\r\\nBecause design and construction of such a tunnel will take an estimated 15 years, a shorter-term (and slightly lower cost) interim solution has also been developed. This S1.6 billion scheme (2006 prices) involves two shorter tunnels (one taking storm water from Hammersmith to Battersea for treatment or storage, the other carrying water from Abbey Mills south to the river at Beckton) and improvements to associated treatment facilities.[11]\\r\\nLater vestries","input":"When was the sewage system built in london?"},{"output":"April 6, 1866","context":"The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) was a fraternal organization composed of veterans of the Union Army (United States Army), Union Navy (U.S. Navy), Marines and the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service who served in the American Civil War. Founded in 1866 in Decatur, Illinois, and growing to include hundreds of posts (local community units) across the nation (predominately in the North, but also a few in the South and West), it was dissolved in 1956 at the death of its last member, Albert Woolson (1850ÿ1956) of Duluth, Minnesota. Linking men through their experience of the war, the G.A.R. became among the first organized advocacy groups in American politics, supporting voting rights for black veterans, promoting patriotic education, helping to make Memorial Day a national holiday, lobbying the United States Congress to establish regular veterans' pensions, and supporting Republican political candidates. Its peak membership, at more than 490,000, was in 1890, a high point of various Civil War commemorative and monument dedication ceremonies. It was succeeded by the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW), composed of male descendants of Union Army and Union Navy veterans.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the end of American Civil War, various state and local organizations were formed for veterans to network and maintain connections with each other. Many of the veterans used their shared experiences as a basis for fellowship. Groups of men began joining together, first for camaraderie and later for political power. Emerging as most influential among the various organizations during the first post-war years was the Grand Army of the Republic, founded on April 6, 1866, on the principles of \\"Fraternity, Charity and Loyalty,\\" in Decatur, Illinois, by Dr. Benjamin F. Stephenson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GAR initially grew and prospered as a de facto political arm of the Republican Party during the heated political contests of the Reconstruction Era. The commemoration of Union Army and Navy veterans, black and white, immediately became entwined with partisan politics. The GAR promoted voting rights for Negro veterans, as many white veterans recognized their demonstrated patriotism and sacrifices, providing one of the first racially integrated social/fraternal organizations in America. Black veterans, who enthusiastically embraced the message of equality, shunned black veterans' organizations in preference for racially inclusive and integrated groups. But when the Republican Party's commitment to reform in the South gradually decreased, the GAR's mission became ill-defined and the organization floundered. The GAR almost disappeared in the early 1870s, and many state-centered divisions, named \\"departments\\", and local posts ceased to exist.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his General Order No. 11, dated May 5, 1868, first GAR Commander-in-Chief, General John A. Logan declared May 30 to be Memorial Day (also referred to for many years as \\"Decoration Day\\"), calling upon the GAR membership to make the May 30 observance an annual occurrence. Although not the first time war graves had been decorated, Logan's order effectively established \\"Memorial Day\\" as the day upon which Americans now pay tribute to all their war casualties, missing-in-action, and deceased veterans. As decades passed, similarly inspired commemorations also spread across the South as \\"Confederate Memorial Day\\" or \\"Confederate Decoration Day\\", usually in April, led by organizations of Southern soldiers in the parallel United Confederate Veterans.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1880s, the Union veterans' organization revived under new leadership that provided a platform for renewed growth, by advocating Federal pensions for veterans. As the organization revived, black veterans joined in significant numbers and organized local posts. The national organization, however, failed to press the case for similar pensions for black soldiers. Most black troops never received any pension or remuneration for wounds incurred during their Civil War service.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GAR was organized into \\"Departments\\" at the state level and \\"Posts\\" at the community level, and military-style uniforms were worn by its members. There were posts in every state in the U.S., and several posts overseas.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pattern of establishing departments and local posts was later used by other American military veterans' organizations, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars (organized originally for veterans of the SpanishÿAmerican War and the Philippine Insurrection) and the later American Legion (for the First World War and later expanded to include subsequent World War II, Korean, Vietnam and Middle Eastern wars).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe G.A.R.'s political power grew during the latter part of the 19th century, and it helped elect several United States presidents, beginning with the 18th, Ulysses S. Grant, and ending with the 25th, William McKinley. Five Civil War veterans and members (Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, and McKinley) were elected President of the United States; all were Republicans. (The sole post-war Democratic president was Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th chief executive.) For a time, candidates could not get Republican presidential or congressional nominations without the endorsement of the GAR veterans voting bloc.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith membership strictly limited to \\"veterans of the late unpleasantness,\\" the GAR encouraged the formation of Allied Orders to aid them in various works. Numerous male organizations jousted for the backing of the GAR, and the political battles became quite severe until the GAR finally endorsed the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War as its heir.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough an overwhelmingly male organization, the GAR is known to have had at least two women who were members.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first female known to be admitted to the GAR was Kady Brownell, who served in the Union Army with her husband Robert, a private in the 1st Rhode Island Infantry at the First Battle of Bull Run in Virginia and with the 5th Rhode Island Infantry at the Battle of New Berne in North Carolina.  Kady was admitted as a member in 1870 to Elias Howe Jr. Post #3, in Bridgeport, Connecticut.  The GAR insignia is engraved on her gravestone in the North Burial Ground in Providence, Rhode Island.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1897 the GAR admitted Sarah Emma Edmonds, who served in the 2nd Michigan Infantry as a disguised man named Franklin Thompson from May 1861 until April 1863. In 1882, she collected affidavits from former comrades in an effort to petition for a veteran's pension which she received in July 1884. Edmonds was only a member for a brief period as she died September 5, 1898; however she was given a funeral with military honors when she was reburied in Houston in 1901.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible that other women were members of the GAR as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nKady Brownwell\\r\\n\\r\\nSarah Emma Edmonds\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GAR reached its largest enrollment in 1890, with 490,000 members. It held an annual \\"National Encampment\\" every year from 1866 to 1949. At that final encampment in Indianapolis, Indiana, the few surviving members voted to retain the existing officers in place until the organization's dissolution; Theodore Penland of Oregon, the GAR's Commander at the time, was therefore its last. In 1956, after the death of the last member, Albert Woolson, the GAR was formally dissolved.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are physical memorials to the Grand Army of the Republic in numerous communities throughout the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. Route 6 is known as the Grand Army of the Republic Highway for its entire length.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commemoration of the American Civil War on postage stamps began during the conflict by both sides. In 1948, the Grand Army of the Republic was commemorated on a stamp.[7] In 1951, the U.S. Postal Service printed a virtually identical stamp for the final reunion of the United Confederate Veterans.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery state (even those of the former Confederacy) fell within a GAR \\"Department,\\" and within these Departments were the \\"Posts\\" (forerunners of modern American Legion Halls or VFW Halls). The posts were made up of local veterans, many of whom participated in local civic events. As the posts were formed, they were assign to the home Department of the National Commander-in-chief of the year that they were chartered. There was no GAR post in London, but there was a Civil War Veterans Association Group that had many GAR members belonging to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Civil War veterans died or were no longer able to participate in GAR activities, posts consolidated or were disbanded.[9] Posts were assigned a sequential number based on their admission into the state's GAR organization, and most posts held informal names which honored comrades, battles, or commanders; it was not uncommon to have more than one post in a state honoring the same individual (such as Abraham Lincoln) and posts often changed their informal designation by vote of the local membership.\\r\\nSee:\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Steinbeck's East of Eden features several references to the Grand Army of the Republic. Despite having very little actual battle experience during his brief military career, cut short by the loss of his leg, Adam Trask's father Cyrus joins the GAR and assumes the stature of \\"a great man\\" through his involvement with the organization. At the height of the GAR's influence in Washington, he brags to his son:\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder if you know how much influence I really have. I can throw the Grand Army at any candidate like a sock. Even the President likes to know what I think about public matters. I can get senators defeated and I can pick appointments like apples. I can make men and I can destroy men. Do you know that? \\r\\nLater in the book, references are made to the graves of GAR members in California in order to emphasize the passage of time.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSinclair Lewis also refers to the GAR in his acclaimed novel Main Street[11] and in his novel It Can't Happen Here,[12] as does Charles Portis's classic novel, True Grit,[13] the GAR is briefly mentioned in William Faulkner's novel, The Sound and the Fury.[14] and Willa Cather's short story The Sculptor's Funeral briefly references the GAR.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GAR is mentioned in the seldom-sung second verse of the patriotic song You're a Grand Old Flag.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GAR is referenced in John McCrae's poem He Is There! which was set to music in 1917 by Charles Ives as part of his cycle Three Songs of the War.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ward Moore's 1953 alternate history novel Bring the Jubilee, the Confederates won the Civil War and became a major world power while the rump United States was reduced to an impoverished dependence.

In fact, the United States never adhered to free trade until 1945. A very protectionist policy was adopted as soon as the presidency of George Washington by Alexander Hamilton, the first US Secretary of the Treasury from 1789 to 1795 and author of the text Report on Manufactures which called for customs barriers to allow American industrial development and to help protect infant industries, including bounties (subsidies) derived in part from those tariffs. This text was one of the references of the German economist Friedrich List (1789ÿ1846). This policy remained throughout the 19th century and the overall level of tariffs was very high (close to 50% in 1830). The victory of the protectionist states of the North over the free trade southern states at the end of the Civil War (1861ÿ1865) perpetuated this trend, even during periods of free trade in Europe (1860ÿ1880).[3]\\r\\nHamilton explained that despite an initial increase of price caused by regulations that control foreign competition, once a domestic manufacture has attained to perfection it invariably becomes cheaper. George Washington signed the Tariff Act of 1789, making it the Republic's second ever piece of legislation. Increasing the domestic supply of manufactured goods, particularly war materials, was seen as an issue of national security. Washington and Hamilton believed that political independence was predicated upon economic independence.[4]\\r\\nIn the 19th century, statesmen such as Senator Henry Clay continued Hamilton's themes within the Whig Party under the name \\"American System.\\" The fledgling Republican Party led by Abraham Lincoln, who called himself a \\"Henry Clay tariff Whig\\", strongly opposed free trade, and implemented a 44-percent tariff during the Civil Warin part to pay for railroad subsidies and for the war effort, and to protect favored industries.[5]\\r\\nFrom 1871 to 1913, the average U.S. tariff on dutiable imports never fell below 38 percent [and] gross national product (GNP) grew 4.3 percent annually, twice the pace in free trade Britain and well above the U.S. average in the 20th century, notes Alfred Eckes Jr., chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission under President Reagan.\\r\\nIn 1896, the GOP platform pledged to renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of American industrial independence, and the foundation of development and prosperity. This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages home industry. It puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods; it secures the American market for the American producer. It upholds the American standard of wages for the American workingman.\\r\\nThe small Spanish town of Tarifa is sometimes credited with being the origin of the word \\"tariff\\", since it was the first port in history to charge merchants for the use of its docks.[6] The name \\"Tarifa\\" itself is derived from the name of the Berber warrior, Tarif ibn Malik. However, other sources assume that the origin of tariff is the Italian word tariffa translated as \\"list of prices, book of rates\\", which is derived from the Arabic ta'rif meaning \\"making known\\" or \\"to define\\".[7]\\r\\nA customs duty or due is the indirect tax levied on the import or export of goods in international trade. In economic sense, a duty is also a kind of consumption tax. A duty levied on goods being imported is referred to as an import duty. Similarly, a duty levied on exports is called an export duty. A tariff, which is actually a list of commodities along with the leviable rate (amount) of customs duty, is popularly referred to as a customs duty.\\r\\nCustoms duty is calculated on the determination of the assessable value in case of those items for which the duty is levied ad valorem. This is often the transaction value unless a customs officer determines assessable value in accordance with the Harmonized System. For certain items like petroleum and alcohol, customs duty is realized at a specific rate applied to the volume of the import or export consignments.\\r\\nFor the purpose of assessment of customs duty, products are given an identification code that has come to be known as the Harmonized System code. This code was developed by the World Customs Organization based in Brussels. A Harmonized System code may be from four to ten digits. For example, 17.03 is the HS code for molasses from the extraction or refining of sugar. However, within 17.03, the number 17.03.90 stands for \\"Molasses (Excluding Cane Molasses)\\".\\r\\nIntroduction of Harmonized System code in 1990s has largely replaced the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), though SITC remains in use for statistical purposes. In drawing up the national tariff, the revenue departments often specifies the rate of customs duty with reference to the HS code of the product. In some countries and customs unions, 6-digit HS codes are locally extended to 8 digits or 10 digits for further tariff discrimination: for example the European Union uses its 8-digit CN (Combined Nomenclature) and 10-digit TARIC codes.\\r\\nA Customs authority in each country is responsible for collecting taxes on the import into or export of goods out of the country. Normally the Customs authority, operating under national law, is authorized to examine cargo in order to ascertain actual description, specification volume or quantity, so that the assessable value and the rate of duty may be correctly determined and applied.\\r\\nEvasion of customs duties takes place mainly in two ways. In one, the trader under-declares the value so that the assessable value is lower than actual. In a similar vein, a trader can evade customs duty by understatement of quantity or volume of the product of trade. A trader may also evade duty by misrepresenting traded goods, categorizing goods as items which attract lower customs duties. The evasion of customs duty may take place with or without the collaboration of customs officials. Evasion of customs duty does not necessarily constitute smuggling.[citation needed]\\r\\nMany countries allow a traveler to bring goods into the country duty-free. These goods may be bought at ports and airports or sometimes within one country without attracting the usual government taxes and then brought into another country duty-free. Some countries impose allowances which limit the number or value of duty-free items that one person can bring into the country. These restrictions often apply to tobacco, wine, spirits, cosmetics, gifts and souvenirs. Often foreign diplomats and UN officials are entitled to duty-free goods. Duty-free goods are imported and stocked in what is called a bonded warehouse.\\r\\nWith many methods and regulations, businesses at times struggle to manage the duties. In addition to difficulties in calculations, there are challenges in analyzing duties; and to opt for duty free options like using a bonded warehouse.\\r\\nCompanies use ERP software to calculate duties automatically to, on one hand, avoid error-prone manual work on duty regulations and formulas and on the other hand, manage and analyze the historically paid duties. Moreover, ERP software offers an option for customs warehouse, introduced to save duty and VAT payments. In addition, the duty deferment and suspension is also taken into consideration.\\r\\nNeoclassical economic theorists tend to view tariffs as distortions to the free market. Typical analyses find that tariffs tend to benefit domestic producers and government at the expense of consumers, and that the net welfare effects of a tariff on the importing country are negative. Normative judgements often follow from these findings, namely that it may be disadvantageous for a country to artificially shield an industry from world markets and that it might be better to allow a collapse to take place. Opposition to all tariff aims to reduce tariffs and to avoid countries discriminating between differing countries when applying tariffs. The diagrams to the right show the costs and benefits of imposing a tariff on a good in the domestic economy.\\r\\nWhen incorporating free international trade into the model we use a supply curve denoted as \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\nt\\r\\na\\r\\nr\\r\\ni\\r\\nf\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle P_{tariff}}\\r\\n\\r\\n (diagram 1) or \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\nw\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle P_{w}}\\r\\n\\r\\n (diagram 2). This curve represents the assumption that the international supply of the good or service is perfectly elastic and that the world can produce at a near infinite quantity of the good. Before the tariff, there is a quantity demanded of Qc1 (diagram 1) or D (diagram 2). The difference between quantity demanded and quantity supplied (between D and S on diagram 2, respectively) was filled by importing from abroad. This is shown on diagram 1 as Quantity of Imports (without tariff). After the imposition of a tariff, domestic price rises, but foreign export prices fall due to the difference in tax incidence on the consumers (at home) and producers (abroad).\\r\\nThe new price level at Home is Ptariff or Pt, which is higher than the world price. More of the good is now produced at Home ÿ it now makes Qs2 (diagram 1) or S* (diagram 2) of the good. Due to the higher price, only Qc2 or D* of the good is demanded by Home. The difference between the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded is still filled by importing from abroad. However, the imposition of the tariff reduces the quantity of imports from D ? S to D* ? S* (diagram 2). This is also shown in diagram 1 as Quantity of Imports (with tariff).\\r\\nDomestic producers enjoy a gain in their surplus. Producer surplus, defined as the difference between what the producers were willing to receive by selling a good and the actual price of the good, expands from the region below Pw to the region below Pt. Therefore, the domestic producers gain an amount shown by the area A.\\r\\nDomestic consumers face a higher price, reducing their welfare. Consumer surplus is the area between the price line and the demand curve. Therefore, the consumer surplus shrinks from the area above Pw to the area above Pt, i.e. it shrinks by the areas A, B, C and D. This includes the gained producer surplus, the deadweight loss, and the tax revenue.\\r\\nThe government gains from the taxes. It charges an amount Pt ? Pt* of tariff for every good imported. Since D* ? S* goods are imported, the government gains an area of C and E. However, there is a deadweight loss of the triangles B and D, or in diagram 1, the triangles labeled Societal Loss. Deadweight loss is also called efficiency loss. This cost is incurred because tariffs reduce the incentives for the society to consume and produce.\\r\\nThe net loss to the society due to the tariff would be given by the total costs of the tariff minus its benefits to the society. Therefore, the net welfare loss due to the tariff is equal to:\\r\\nor graphically, this gain is given by the areas shown by:\\r\\nThat is, tariffs are beneficial to the society if the area given by the rectangle E is greater than the deadweight loss. Rectangle E is called the terms of trade gain.\\r\\nThe tariff has been used as a political tool to establish an independent nation; for example, the United States Tariff Act of 1789, signed specifically on July 4, was called the \\"Second Declaration of Independence\\" by newspapers because it was intended to be the economic means to achieve the political goal of a sovereign and independent United States.[8]\\r\\nThe political impact of tariffs is judged depending on the political perspective; for example the 2002 United States steel tariff imposed a 30% tariff on a variety of imported steel products for a period of three years and American steel producers supported the tariff.[9]\\r\\nTariffs can emerge as a political issue prior to an election. In the leadup to the 2007 Australian Federal election, the Australian Labor Party announced it would undertake a review of Australian car tariffs if elected.[10] The Liberal Party made a similar commitment, while independent candidate Nick Xenophon announced his intention to introduce tariff-based legislation as \\"a matter of urgency\\".[11]\\r\\nUnpopular tariffs are known to have ignited social unrest, for example the 1905 meat riots in Chile that developed in protest against tariffs applied to the cattle imports from Argentina.[12][13]\\r\\nWhen tariffs are an integral element of a country's technology strategy, some economists believe that such tariffs can be highly effective in helping to increase and maintain the country's economic health. Other economists might be less enthusiastic, as tariffs may reduce trade and there may be many spillovers and externalities involved with trade and tariffs. The existence of these externalities makes the imposition of tariffs a rather ambiguous strategy. As an integral part of the technology strategy, tariffs are effective in supporting the technology strategy's function of enabling the country to outmaneuver the competition in the acquisition and utilization of technology in order to produce products and provide services that excel at satisfying the customer needs for a competitive advantage in domestic and foreign markets. The notion that government and policy would be effective at finding new and infant technologies, rather than supporting existing politically motivated industry, rather than, say, international technology venture specialists, is however, unproven.\\r\\nThis is related to the infant industry argument.\\r\\nIn contrast, in economic theory tariffs are viewed as a primary element in international trade with the function of the tariff being to influence the flow of trade by lowering or raising the price of targeted goods to create what amounts to an artificial competitive advantage. When tariffs are viewed and used in this fashion, they are addressing the country's and the competitors' respective economic healths in terms of maximizing or minimizing revenue flow rather than in terms of the ability to generate and maintain a competitive advantage which is the source of the revenue. As a result, the impact of the tariffs on the economic health of the country are at best minimal but often are counter-productive.\\r\\nA program within the US intelligence community, Project Socrates, that was tasked with addressing America's declining economic competitiveness, determined that countries like China and India were using tariffs as an integral element of their respective technology strategies to rapidly build their countries into economic superpowers. However, the US intelligence community tends to have limited inputs into developing US trade policy. It was also determined that the US, in its early years, had also used tariffs as an integral part of what amounted to technology strategies to transform the country into a superpower.[14]\\r\\n Media related to tariffs at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the origin of the word tariff?"},{"output":"Gregg Henry","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belko Experiment is a 2016 American horror-thriller film directed by Greg McLean and written by James Gunn. The film stars John Gallagher Jr., Tony Goldwyn, Adria Arjona, John C. McGinley and Melonie Diaz. Filming began on June 1, 2015, in Bogot, Colombia. The film premiered at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2016 and was released in the United States on March 17, 2017, by Blumhouse Tilt and Orion Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $11 million worldwide, against its $5 million budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nMike Milch (John Gallagher Jr.), an employee of Belko Industries, arrives at his remote office building in rural Bogot, Colombia, to find unfamiliar security guards turning away the local Colombian staff at the gate. New employee Dany Wilkins (Melonie Diaz) reports for her day on the job, and is told that a tracking device is implanted in the base of every Belko employee's skull in case they are kidnapped. This is common in Colombia due to the high incidence of kidnapping.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvan Smith (James Earl), Belko's head security guard, does not know who the new security guards are. Once the eightieth employee shows up, a voice on the intercom instructs the co-workers to kill two of their co-workers, or else four workers will be killed at random. Several staff attempt to flee the building, but steel shutters seal off the walls and doors, locking them all in. They ignore the announcement at first, believing it to be a prank, but four employees die when explosives hidden in their trackers detonate and blow their heads apart. Mike attempts to remove his tracker with a box cutter. Warned by the voice that he too will die unless he stops, he gives up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group is told that unless thirty of them are dead within two hours, sixty will be killed. They split into two factions, one led by Mike who believes that there should be no killing, and chief operating officer boss Barry Norris (Tony Goldwyn) who intends to follow the directions in order to save himself. Barry and his group attempt to burn off the lock of the armory in order to gain access to its weapons. Mike and his group, including his girlfriend Leandra Florez (Adria Arjona), Evan and employees Keith (Josh Brener), Leota (Gail Bean), Peggy (Rusty Schwimmer), Vince (Brent Sexton) and Roberto (David Del Rio), try to hang banners from the roof as a call for help, but soldiers outside shoot at them. Barry, executive Wendell (John C. McGinley), and employee Terry (Owain Yeoman) ambush the group in the stairway, kill Evan and take his keys to the armory.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his group now armed, Barry and Wendell select thirty people, including Mike and Peggy, forcing them to kneel in a line. He begins executing them with a gunshot to the back of the head. Dany, who has been hiding in the basement, sees what is happening and shuts off the building's lights before Mike and several others can be killed. During this, Dany goes into the elevator shaft with Roberto.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarry and Wendell hunt down the fleeing employees as the voice informs them that only twenty-nine have been killed. The two-hour time limit runs out and Terry, Leota, Peggy and Keith, along with twenty-seven other employees, have their trackers explode, leaving only 16 survivors. They are then informed by the voice that, as a final task, the employee who has killed the most people within an hour will be spared. Barry finds Dany and Roberto in the elevator shaft, but Dany escapes while Roberto is crushed and killed in the elevator shaft. Two employees, Marty (Sean Gunn) and Chet (Abraham Benrubi) collect the un-exploded trackers from the heads of people who have died by other methods, planning to use them to blow up the wall. However, they are killed by Wendell. Leandra kills Wendell, and Barry kills Vince and Dany. He then shoots Leandra, who dies shortly after. Mike and Barry are left as the only two survivors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a rage, Mike kills Barry with a tape dispenser. The building is then unsealed, as he is the last survivor, and the soldiers escort him to the hangar next door. There, he meets the owner of the voice (Gregg Henry), who introduces himself as a social scientist who believes that discoveries about human nature can only come from placing people in extreme environments. As he and his colleagues begin to question Mike about his emotional and mental state, Mike notices a panel of switches that correspond to the eighty employees. Having planted the trackers that Marty collected on the soldiers and the Voice, he flips every switch except his own. The trackers explode, killing the soldiers and wounding the Voice, before Mike grabs a gun and kills the remaining scientists. The Voice attempts to reason with Mike but Mike kills him. He then leaves the warehouse in a state of shock. The view zooms out to reveal that Mike is one of many sole survivors from similar experiments, being watched by another group through security cameras. A new voice states \\"end stage one\\" and \\"commence stage two.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Gunn began writing the film after waking up from a dream of an office building being enclosed in metal walls and hearing a voice instruct employees to kill each other. Initially Gunn wrote the film (as The Belco Experiment) prior to directing the 2010 film Super, although he backed away from the project once it got greenlit, owing to getting a divorce around the same time.[15] Says Gunn \\"I just wanted to be around my friends and family. I didn't want to go shoot this thing that was about people who loved and cared about each other being forced into killing each other. It just didn't seem to be the way I wanted to spend the next few months of my life.

It is the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement within the borders of the continental United States.[7]\\r\\nThe county seat of St. Johns County,[8] it is part of Florida's First Coast region and the Jacksonville metropolitan area. According to the 2010 census, the city population was 12,975. The United States Census Bureau's 2013 estimate of the city's population was 13,679, while the urban area had a population of 71,379 in 2012.[9]\\r\\nSt. Augustine was founded on September 8, 1565, by Spanish admiral Pedro Menndez de Avils, Florida's first governor. He named the settlement \\"San Agustn\\", as his ships bearing settlers, troops, and supplies from Spain had first sighted land in Florida eleven days earlier on August 28, the feast day of St. Augustine.[10] The city served as the capital of Spanish Florida for over 200 years, and became the capital of British East Florida when the territory briefly changed hands between Spain and Britain.\\r\\nSpain ceded Florida to the United States in 1819, and St. Augustine was designated the capital of the Florida Territory upon ratification of the Adams-Ons Treaty in 1821. The Florida National Guard made the city its headquarters that same year. The territorial government moved and made Tallahassee the capital in 1824. Since the late 19th century, St. Augustine's distinct historical character has made the city a major tourist attraction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded in 1565 by the Spanish conquistador, Pedro Menndez de Avils, St. Augustine is the oldest continuously occupied settlement of European origin in the contiguous United States. In 1562, a group of Huguenots led by Jean Ribault arrived in Spanish Florida to establish a colony in the territory claimed by Spain. They explored the mouth of the St. Johns River, calling it la Rivire de Mai (the River May), then sailed northward and established a settlement called Charlesfort at Port Royal Sound in present-day South Carolina. Spain learned of this French expedition through its spies at ports on the Atlantic coast of France. The Huguenot nobleman Ren de Laudonnire, who had participated in the expedition, returned to Florida in 1564 with three ships and 300 Huguenot colonists. He arrived at the mouth of the River May on June 22, 1564, sailed up it a few miles, and founded Fort Caroline.\\r\\nDesiring to protect its claimed territories in North America against such incursions, the Spanish Crown issued an asiento to Menndez, signed by King Philip II on March 20, 1565, granting him expansive trade privileges, the power to distribute lands, and licenses to sell 500 slaves, as well as various titles, including that of adelantado of Florida.[11] This contract directed Menndez to sail for La Florida, reconnoitre it from the Florida Keys to present-day Canada, and report on its coastal features, with a view to establishing a permanent settlement for the defense of the Spanish treasure fleet. He was ordered as well to drive away any intruders who were not subjects of the Spanish crown.[12]\\r\\nOn July 28, Menndez set sail from Cdiz with a fleet led by his 600-ton flagship, the San Pelayo, accompanied by several smaller ships, and carrying over 1,000 sailors, soldiers, and settlers.[13] On the feast day of St. Augustine, August 28, the fleet sighted land and anchored off the north inlet of the tidal channel the French called the River of Dolphins.[14] Menndez then sailed north and confronted Ribault's fleet outside the bar of the River May in a brief skirmish. On September 6, he returned to the site of his first landfall, naming it after the Catholic saint, disembarked his troops, and quickly constructed fortifications to protect his people and supplies.[15][16]\\r\\nMenndez then marched his soldiers overland for a surprise attack on Fort Caroline, where they killed almost everyone in the fort except for the women and children. Jean Ribault had already put out to sea with his ships for an assault on St. Augustine, but was surprised by a storm that wrecked his ships further south. Informed by his Indian allies that the survivors were walking northward on the coast, Menndez began to search for the Frenchmen, who had made it as far as the banks of the Matanzas River's south entrance.[17] There they were confronted by the Spaniard and his men on the opposite side. After several parleys with the Spanish, Jean Ribault and the Frenchmen with him (between 150ÿ350, sources differ) surrendered; almost all of them were executed in the dunes near the inlet, thereafter called Matanzas (Spanish for \\"slaughters\\").[18]\\r\\nIn May 1566, as relations with the neighboring Timucua Indians deteriorated, Menndez moved the Spanish settlement to a more defensible position on the north end of the barrier island between the mainland and the sea, and built a wooden fort there. In 1572, the settlement was relocated to the mainland, in the area just south of the future town plaza. Confident that he had fulfilled the primary conditions of his contract with the King, including the building of forts along the coast of La Florida, Menndez returned to Spain in 1567. After several more transatlantic crossings, Menndez fell ill and died on September 17, 1574.[19]\\r\\nSucceeding governors of the province maintained a peaceful coexistence with the local Native Americans, allowing the isolated outpost of St. Augustine some stability for a few years. On May 28 and 29, 1586, soon after the Anglo-Spanish War began between England and Spain, the English privateer Sir Francis Drake sacked and burned St. Augustine.[20] The approach of his large fleet obliged Governor Pedro Menndez Mrquez and the townspeople to flee for their safety. When the English got ashore, they seized some artillery pieces and a royal strongbox containing gold ducats, the garrison payroll.[21] The killing of their sergeant major by the Spanish rearguard caused Drake to order the town burnt.[22][23]\\r\\nIn 1609 and 1611, expeditions were sent out from St. Augustine against the English colony at Jamestown, Virginia.[24] In the second half of the 17th century, unsettled groups of Indians, forced southward by the expanding English colony in Carolina, made raids into Florida and killed the Franciscan priests who served at the Catholic missions. Requests by successive governors of the province to strengthen the presidios garrison and fortifications were ignored by the Crown. The charter of 1663 for the new Province of Carolina, issued by King Charles II of England, was revised in 1665, claiming lands as far southward as 29 degrees north latitude, about 65 miles south of the existing settlement at St. Augustine.[25][26]\\r\\nThe English buccaneer Robert Searle then sacked St. Augustine in 1668, killing sixty people and pillaging government buildings, churches and houses,[27] after which his pirates ransomed off some of their hostages and sold others into slavery. This raid and the establishment of the English settlement at Charles Town spurred the Spanish monarchy to finally acknowledge the threat represented by the new English colonies to the north and strengthen the city's defenses. In 1669, Queen Regent Mariana ordered the Viceroy of New Spain to disburse funds for the construction of a permanent masonry fortress, which began in 1672.[28] The Castillo de San Marcos was completed in 1695, not long before an attack by Governor Moore's forces from Carolina in November, 1702. Failing to take the fort after a siege of 58 days, the British troops burned St. Augustine to the ground as they retreated.[29] In 1740, the town was again besieged, this time by the governor of the British colony of Georgia, General James Oglethorpe, who was also unable to take the fort.[30]\\r\\nThe Treaty of Paris (1763), signed after Great Britain's victory over France and Spain during the Seven Years' War, ceded Florida to Great Britain and consequently St. Augustine became a Loyalist haven during the American Revolutionary War.[31] The second Treaty of Paris (1783), which recognized the independence of the former British colonies north of Florida, also ceded Florida back to Spain, and as a result many of the town's Spanish citizens returned to St Augustine. Refugees from Dr. Andrew Turnbull's troubled colony in New Smyrna had fled to St. Augustine in 1777, and made up the majority of the city's population during British rule. This group was, and still is, referred to locally as \\"Menorcans\\", even though it also included settlers from Italy, Corsica and the Greek islands as well.[32][33]\\r\\nDuring the Second Spanish period (1784-1821) of Florida, Spain was dealing with invasions of the Iberian peninsula by Napoleon's armies in the Peninsular War, and struggled to maintain a tenuous hold on its territories in the western hemisphere as revolution swept South America. The royal administration of Florida was neglected, as the province had long been regarded as an unprofitable backwater by the Crown. The United States, however, considered Florida vital to its political and military interests as it expanded its territory in North America, and maneuvered by sometimes clandestine means to acquire it.[34] The AdamsÿOns Treaty, negotiated in 1819 and ratified in 1821, ceded Florida and St. Augustine, still its capital at the time, to the United States.[35]\\r\\nFlorida remained an organized territory of the United States until 1845, when it was admitted into the Union as the State of Florida.[36] The Territorial Period (1821-1845) was marked by protracted wars with the Creek Indian groups who occupied the peninsula, collectively known as \\"Seminoles\\", during the Second Seminole War (1835-1842). The United States Army took command of the Castillo de San Marcos and renamed it Fort Marion after General Francis Marion, who fought in the American Revolutionary War. The capital of the territory was moved to Tallahassee in 1824.\\r\\nFlorida joined the Confederacy after the Civil War began in 1861, and Confederate authorities remained in control of St. Augustine for fourteen months, although it was barely defended. Despite the Union blockade of shipping, Union troops gained control of St. Augustine in 1862 and controlled the city through the rest of the war. Its economy already devastated, many of the town's citizens fled.[37][38]\\r\\nHenry Flagler, a co-founder with John D. Rockefeller of the Standard Oil Company, spent the winter of 1883 in St. Augustine and found the city charming, but considered its hotels and transportation systems inadequate.[39] He had the idea to make St. Augustine a winter resort for wealthy Americans from the north, and to bring them south he bought several short line railroads and combined these in 1885 to form the Florida East Coast Railway. He built a railroad bridge over the St. Johns River in 1888, opening up the Atlantic coast of Florida to development.[40][41]\\r\\nFlagler began construction in 1887 on two large ornate hotels in the city, the 540-room Ponce de Leon Hotel and the 250-room Hotel Alcazar. The next year, he purchased the Casa Monica Hotel across the street from both the Alcazar and the Ponce de Leon. His chosen architectural firm, Carrre and Hastings, radically altered the appearance of St. Augustine with these hotels, giving it a skyline and beginning an architectural trend in the state characterized by the use of the Moorish Revival style. With the opening of the Ponce de Leon in 1888, St. Augustine became the winter resort of American high society for a few years.[42]\\r\\nWhen Flagler's Florida East Coast Railroad was extended southward to Palm Beach and then Miami in the early 20th Century, the rich mostly abandoned St. Augustine. Wealthy vacationers began to customarily spend their winters in South Florida, where the climate was warmer and freezes were rare. St. Augustine nevertheless still attracted tourists, and eventually became a destination for families traveling in automobiles as new highways were built and Americans took to the road for annual summer vacations. The tourist industry soon became the dominant sector of the local economy.[43]\\r\\nIn late 1963, nearly a decade after the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that segregation of schools was unconstitutional, African Americans were still trying to get St. Augustine to integrate the public schools in the city. They were also trying to integrate public accommodations, such as lunch counters,[44] and were met with arrests[45] and Ku Klux Klan violence.[46][47] Local college students held non-violent protests throughout the city, including sit-ins at the local Woolworth's, picket lines, and marches through the downtown. These protests were often met with police violence. Homes of African Americans were firebombed,[48] black leaders were assaulted and threatened with death, and others were fired from their jobs.\\r\\nIn the spring of 1964, St. Augustine civil rights leader Robert Hayling[49] asked the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and its leader Martin Luther King, Jr. for assistance.[50] From May until July 1964, King and Hayling, along with Andrew Young, organized marches, sit-ins, and other forms of peaceful protest in St. Augustine. Hundreds of black and white civil rights supporters were arrested,[51] and the jails were filled to capacity.[52] At the request of Hayling and King, white civil rights supporters from the North, including students, clergy, and well-known public figures, came to St. Augustine and were arrested together with Southern activists.[53][54][55]\\r\\nSt. Augustine was the only place in Florida where King was arrested; his arrest there occurred on June 11, 1964, on the steps of the Monson Motor Lodge's restaurant. The demonstrations came to a climax when a group of black and white protesters jumped into the hotel's segregated swimming pool. In response to the protest, James Brock, the manager of the hotel and the president of the Florida Hotel & Motel Association, poured what he claimed to be muriatic acid into the pool to burn the protesters. Photographs of this, and of a policeman jumping into the pool to arrest the protesters, were broadcast around the world.\\r\\nThe Ku Klux Klan responded to these protests with violent attacks that were widely reported in national and international media.[56] Popular revulsion against the Klan and police violence in St. Augustine generated national sympathy for the black protesters and became a key factor in Congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,[57] leading eventually to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,[58] both of which provided federal enforcement of constitutional rights.\\r\\nIn 1965, St. Augustine celebrated the 400th anniversary of its founding,[59] and jointly with the State of Florida, inaugurated a program to restore part of the colonial city. The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board was formed to reconstruct more than thirty-six buildings to their historical appearance, which was completed within a few years. When the State of Florida abolished the Board in 1997, the City of St. Augustine assumed control of the reconstructed buildings, as well as other historic properties including the Government House. In 2010, the city transferred control of the historic buildings to the University of Florida.\\r\\nIn 2015, St. Augustine celebrated the 450th anniversary of its founding with four-day long festival and a visit from Felipe VI of Spain and Queen Letizia of Spain.[60]\\r\\nOn October 7, 2016 Hurricane Matthew caused widespread flooding in downtown St. Augustine.[61]\\r\\nSt. Augustine is located at 295341N 811852W? / ?29.89472N 81.31444W? / 29.89472; -81.31444 (29.8946910, ?81.3145170).[1] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.7 square miles (27.8?km2), 8.4 square miles (21.7?km2) of which is land and 2.4 square miles (6.1?km2) (21.99%) is water. Access to the Atlantic Ocean is via the St. Augustine Inlet of the Matanzas River.\\r\\nSt. Augustine has a humid subtropical climate or Cfa ÿ typical of the Gulf and South Atlantic states. The low latitude and coastal location give the city a mostly warm and sunny climate. Like much of Florida, St. Augustine enjoys a high number of sunny days, averaging 2,900 hours annually. Unlike much of the contiguous United States, St. Augustines driest time of year is winter. The hot and wet season extends from May through October, while the cool and dry season extends November through April.\\r\\nIn the hot season, average daytime highs are in the upper 80s to low 90s ?F (26 to 33?C) and average night-time lows are in the low 70s?F (21?C). The Bermuda High pumps in hot and unstable tropical air from the Bahamas and Gulf of Mexico, which help create the daily thundershowers that are typical in summer months. Intense but very brief downpours are common in mid-summer in the city. Fall and spring are warm and sunny with highs in the 75 to 80 F (21 to 24?C) range and overnight lows in the 50s to low 60s (10 to 17?C).\\r\\nIn the dry winter season, St. Augustine has generally mild and sunny weather typical of the Florida peninsula. The coolest months are from December through February, with average daytime highs that range from 65 to 70?F (18 to 21?C) and nighttime lows in the 46-49 F (8 to 10?C) range. From November through April, St. Augustine often has long periods of rainless weather. Early spring (April) can see near drought conditions with brush fires and water restrictions in place. St. Augustine averages six frosts per year. Hurricanes occasionally impact the region; however, like most areas prone to such storms, St. Augustine rarely suffers a direct hit by a major hurricane. The last direct hit by a major hurricane to the city was Hurricane Dora in 1964. Extensive flooding occurred in the downtown area of St. Augustine when Hurricane Matthew passed east of the city in October 2016.[62]\\r\\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, there were 12,975 people, 5,743 households, and 2,679 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,376.2 people per square mile (531/km2). There were 6,978 housing units at an average density of 549.4 per square mile (211.4/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 84.2% Caucasian, 11.6% African American, 0.4% Native American, 1.2% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.8% from other races, and 1.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.1% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 5,743 households out of which 14.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.7% were married couples living together, 10.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 53.4% were non-families. 37.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 14.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.03 and the average family size was 2.67.\\r\\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 13.1% under the age of 18, 15.3% from 18 to 24, 23.9% from 25 to 44, 25.2% from 45 to 64, and 19% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42.6 years. For every 100 females there were 88.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.8 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $36,424, and the median income for a family was $56,055. Males had a median income of $32,409 versus $30,188 for females. The per capita income for the city was $23,485. About 7.6% of families and 21.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.8% of those under age 18 and 24.4% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nBus service is operated by the Sunshine Bus Company. Buses operate mainly between shopping centers across town, but a few go to Hastings and Jacksonville, where one can connect to JTA for additional service across Jacksonville.\\r\\nSt. Augustine has one public airport 4 miles (6.4?km) north of the downtown. It has three runways and two seaplane lanes.[65] Frontier Airlines provides seasonal service from the airport to Philadelphia and ViaAir provides seasonal service to Charlotte.[66] Various private jets and tour helicopters also operate from the airport. Northrop Grumman runs a large manufacturing plant on the grounds, where the E-2 Hawkeye is produced.\\r\\nPrimary and secondary education in St. Augustine is overseen by the St. Johns County School District. There are no county high schools located within St. Augustine's current city limits, but St. Augustine High School, Pedro Menendez High School, and St. Johns Technical High School are located in the vicinity. The Florida School for the Deaf and Blind, a state-operated boarding school for deaf and blind students, was founded in the city in 1885.[67] The Catholic Diocese of St. Augustine operates the St. Joseph Academy, Florida's oldest Catholic high school, to the west of the city.[68]\\r\\nThere are several institutions of higher education in and around St. Augustine. Flagler College is a four-year liberal arts college founded in 1968. It is located in the former Ponce de Leon Hotel in downtown St. Augustine.[69] St. Johns River State College, a state college in the Florida College System, has its St. Augustine campus just west of the city. Also in the area are the University of North Florida, Jacksonville University, and Florida State College at Jacksonville in Jacksonville.[70]\\r\\nThe institution now known as Florida Memorial University was located in St. Augustine from 1918 to 1968, when it relocated to its present campus in Miami. Originally known as Florida Baptist Academy, then Florida Normal, and then Florida Memorial College, it was a historically black institution and had a wide impact on St. Augustine while it was located there. During World War II it was chosen as the site for training the first blacks in the U. S. Signal Corps. Among its faculty members was Zora Neale Hurston; a historic marker is placed at the house where she lived while teaching at Florida Memorial[71] (and where she wrote her autobiography Dust Tracks on a Road.)[72][73]\\r\\nBell tower on northeast bastion of the Castillo de San Marcos\\r\\nNorth bastions and wall of the Castillo, looking eastward toward Anastasia Island\\r\\nSeawall south of the Castillo\\r\\nThe city gates of St. Augustine, built in 1808, part of the much older Cubo Line\\r\\nThe Government House.

In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple syrup was first collected and used by the indigenous peoples of North America, and the practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually refined production methods.

The Canadian province of Quebec is by far the largest producer, responsible for 70 percent of the world's output; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were C$ 487 million (about US$ 360 million), with Quebec accounting for some 90 percent of this total.[1][2] Vermont is the largest producer in the United States, generating about six percent of the global supply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple syrup is graded according to the Canada, United States, or Vermont scales based on its density and translucency. Sucrose is the most prevalent sugar in maple syrup. In Canada, syrups must be made exclusively from maple sap to qualify as maple syrup and must also be at least 66 percent sugar.[3] In the United States, a syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap to be labelled as \\"maple\\", though states such as Vermont and New York have more restrictive definitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple syrup is often used as a condiment for pancakes, waffles, French toast, oatmeal or porridge. It is also used as an ingredient in baking and as a sweetener or flavouring agent. Culinary experts have praised its unique flavour, although the chemistry responsible is not fully understood.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree species of maple trees are predominantly used to produce maple syrup: the sugar maple (Acer saccharum), the black maple (A. nigrum), and the red maple (A. rubrum),[5] because of the high sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species.[6] The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of A. saccharum, the sugar maple, by some botanists.[7] Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavour of the sap.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nA few other (but not all) species of maple (Acer) are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple syrup, including the box elder or Manitoba maple (Acer negundo),[9] the silver maple (A. saccharinum),[10] and the bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum).[11] Similar syrups may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndigenous peoples living in northeastern North America were the first groups known to have produced maple syrup and maple sugar. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region.[14][15] There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began,[16] but various legends exist; one of the most popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief.[15] Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance.[17] Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Algonquians recognized maple sap as a source of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they used stone tools to make V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into buckets, which were often made from birch bark.[16] The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the buckets[18] or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early stages of European colonization in northeastern North America, local Indigenous peoples showed the arriving colonists how to tap the trunks of certain types of maples during the spring thaw to harvest the sap.[19] Andr Thevet, the \\"Royal Cosmographer of France\\", wrote about Jacques Cartier drinking maple sap during his Canadian voyages.[20] By 1680, European settlers and fur traders were involved in harvesting maple products.[21] However, rather than making incisions in the bark, the Europeans used the method of drilling tapholes in the trunks with augers. During the 17th and 18th centuries, processed maple sap was used primarily as a source of concentrated sugar, in both liquid and crystallized-solid form, as cane sugar had to be imported from the West Indies.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple sugaring parties typically began to operate at the start of the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples.[19] Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment's core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container.[16] Sap filled the buckets, and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels (barrels, large pots, or hollowed-out wooden logs), often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals, or carried in buckets or other convenient containers.[22] The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees, and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained \\"sweet\\". The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the sugaring season.[23] As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boiling process was very time-consuming. The harvested sap was transported back to the party's base camp, where it was then poured into large vessels (usually made from metal) and boiled to achieve the desired consistency.[16] The sap was usually transported using large barrels pulled by horses or oxen to a central collection point, where it was processed either over a fire built out in the open or inside a shelter built for that purpose (the \\"sugar shack\\").[16][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the time of the American Civil War (1861-1865), syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more efficient for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation.[24] Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time.[16] Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nBuckets began to be replaced with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used.[16] Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap.[24] Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nA large number of technological changes took place during the 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since the early part of the century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house.[26] Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nImprovements in tubing and vacuum pumps, new filtering techniques, \\"supercharged\\" preheaters, and better storage containers have since been developed. Research continues on pest control and improved woodlot management.[16] In 2009, researchers at the University of Vermont unveiled a new type of tap that prevents backflow of sap into the tree, reducing bacterial contamination and preventing the tree from attempting to heal the bore hole.[27]  Experiments show that it may be possible to use saplings in a plantation instead of mature trees, dramatically boosting productivity per acre.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen pan evaporation methods have been streamlined since colonial days, but remain basically unchanged. Sap must first be collected and boiled down to obtain pure syrup without chemical agents or preservatives. Maple syrup is made by boiling between 20 and 50 volumes of sap (depending on its concentration) over an open fire until 1 volume of syrup is obtained, usually at a temperature 4.1?C (7.4?F) over the boiling point of water. As the boiling point of water varies with changes in air pressure the correct value for pure water is determined at the place where the syrup is being produced, each time evaporation is begun and periodically throughout the day.[24][29] Syrup can be boiled entirely over one heat source or can be drawn off into smaller batches and boiled at a more controlled temperature.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoiling the syrup is a tightly controlled process, which ensures appropriate sugar content.  Syrup boiled too long will eventually crystallize, whereas under-boiled syrup will be watery, and will quickly spoil.  The finished syrup has a density of 66 on the Brix scale (a hydrometric scale used to measure sugar solutions).[31] The syrup is then filtered to remove sugar sand, crystals made up largely of sugar and calcium malate.[32] These crystals are not toxic, but create a \\"gritty\\" texture in the syrup if not filtered out.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to  open pan evaporation methods, many large producers use the more fuel efficient reverse osmosis procedure to separate the water from the sap.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe higher the sugar content of the sap, the smaller the volume of sap is needed to obtain the same amount of syrup. 57 units of sap with 1.5 percent sugar content will yield 1 unit of syrup, but only 25 units of sap with a 3.5 percent sugar content are needed to obtain one unit of syrup.[35] The sap's sugar content is highly variable and will fluctuate even within the same tree.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe filtered syrup is graded and packaged while still hot, usually at a temperature of 82?C (180?F) or greater. The containers are turned over after being sealed to sterilize the cap with the hot syrup. Packages can be made of metal, glass, or coated plastic, depending on volume and target market.[37] The syrup can also be heated longer and further processed to create a variety of other maple products, including maple sugar, maple butter or cream, and maple candy or taffy.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nOff-flavours can sometimes develop during the production of maple syrup, resulting from contaminants in the boiling apparatus (such as disinfectants), microorganisms, fermentation products, metallic can flavours, and \\"buddy sap\\", an off-flavour occurring late in the syrup season when tree budding has begun.[39] In some circumstances, it is possible to remove off-flavours through processing.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple syrup production is centred in northeastern North America; however, given the correct weather conditions, it can be made wherever suitable species of maple trees grow.\\r\\n\\r\\nA maple syrup production farm is called a \\"sugarbush\\" or \\"sugarwood\\". Sap is often boiled in a \\"sugar house\\" (also known as a \\"sugar shack\\", \\"sugar shanty\\", or cabane  sucre), a building louvered at the top to vent the steam from the boiling sap.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaples are usually tapped beginning at 30 to 40 years of age. Each tree can support between one and three taps, depending on its trunk diameter. The average maple tree will produce 35 to 50 litres (9.2 to 13.2?US?gal) of sap per season, up to 12 litres (3.2?US?gal) per day.[42] This is roughly equal to seven percent of its total sap. Seasons last for four to eight weeks, depending on the weather.[43] During the day, starch stored in the roots for the winter rises through the trunk as sugary sap, allowing it to be tapped.[23] Sap is not tapped at night because the temperature drop inhibits sap flow, although taps are typically left in place overnight.[44] Some producers also tap in autumn, though this practice is less common than spring tapping. Maples can continue to be tapped for sap until they are over 100 years old.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 1930s, the United States produced most of the world's maple syrup.[45]  Today, after rapid growth in the 1990s, Canada produces more than 80 percent of the world's maple syrup, producing about 73,000,000 litres (19,000,000?US?gal) in 2016.[1] The vast majority of this comes from the province of Quebec, which is the world's largest producer, with about 70 percent of global production.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2016, Quebec had some 7,300 producers working with 13,500 farmers, collectively making over 8,090,000 US gallons (30,600,000?L) of syrup.[1][46] Production in Quebec is controlled through a supply management system, with producers receiving quota allotments from the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers (Fdration des producteurs acricoles du Qubec, FPAQ), which also maintains reserves of syrup,[1][47] although there is a black-market trade in Quebec product.[1][48][49] In 2017, the FPAQ mandated increased output of maple syrup production, attempting to establish Quebec's dominance in the world market.[1][2] Canada exported more than C$362 million of maple syrup in 2016.[2] The provinces of Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island produce smaller amounts of syrup.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan produce maple syrup using the sap of the box elder or Manitoba maple (Acer negundo).[9]  A Manitoba maple tree's yield is usually less than half that of a similar sugar maple tree.[50] Manitoba maple syrup has a slightly different flavour from sugar-maple syrup, because it contains less sugar and the tree's sap flows more slowly.  British Columbia is home to a growing maple sugar industry using sap from the bigleaf maple, which is native to the West Coast of the United States and Canada.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nVermont is the biggest US producer, with over 1,320,000 US gallons (5,000,000?L) during the 2013 season, followed by New York with 574,000 US gallons (2,170,000?L) and Maine with 450,000 US gallons (1,700,000?L). Wisconsin, Ohio, New Hampshire, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Connecticut all produced marketable quantities of maple syrup of less than 265,000 US gallons (1,000,000?L) each in 2013.[52] As of 2003, Vermont produced about 5.5?percent of the global syrup supply.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple syrup has been produced on a small scale in some other countries, notably Japan and South Korea.[54] However, in South Korea in particular, it is traditional to consume maple sap, called gorosoe, instead of processing it into syrup.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, 64 percent of Canadian maple syrup exports went to the United States (a value of C$229 million), 8 percent to Germany (C$31 million), 6 percent to Japan (C$26 million), and 5 percent to the United Kingdom (C$16 million).[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing an effort from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup producer associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding the classification of maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been a work in progress for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, at the request of the IMSI.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of December 31, 2014, the CFIA[56] and as of March 2, 2015, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service[57] issued revised standards intended to harmonize Canada-United States regulations on the classification of maple syrup as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs long as maple syrup does not have an off-flavour, is of a uniform colour, and is free from turbidity and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements, and then must be labelled as Processing Grade maple syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons.[56][57] If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as Substandard.[56][57]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of February 2015, this grading system has been accepted and made law by most maple-producing states and provinces, other than Ontario, Quebec,[56] and Ohio. Vermont, in an effort to \\"jump-start\\" the new grading regulations, adopted the new grading system as of January 1, 2014, after the grade changes passed the Senate and House in 2013. Maine passed a bill to take effect as soon as both Canada and the United States adopted the new grades. They are allowing a one-year grace period. In New York, the new grade changes became law on January 1, 2015, with a one-year grace period. New Hampshire did not require legislative approval and so the new grade laws became effective as of December 16, 2014, and producer compliance was required as of January 1, 2016.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nGolden and Amber grades typically have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark and have an intense maple flavour.[59] The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use.[60] Syrup harvested earlier in the season tends to yield a lighter colour.[61] With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560?nm wavelength through a 10?mm sample. Golden has to have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, maple syrup was classified prior to December 31, 2014, by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as one of three grades, each with several colour classes:[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nProducers in Ontario or Quebec may have followed either federal or provincial grading guidelines.[56] Quebec's and Ontario's guidelines differed slightly from the federal: \\r\\n\\r\\nA typical year's yield for a maple syrup producer will be about 25 to 30 percent of each of the #1 colours, 10 percent #2 Amber, and 2 percent #3 Dark.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States used (some states still do, as they await state regulation) different grading standards. Maple syrup was divided into two major grades: \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Massachusetts, the Grade B was renamed as Grade A Very Dark, Strong Taste.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets used a similar grading system of colour, and is roughly equivalent, especially for lighter syrups, but using letters: \\"AA\\", \\"A\\", etc.[65][66] The Vermont grading system differed from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density (measured on the Baum scale). New Hampshire maintained a similar standard, but not a separate state grading scale. The Vermont-graded product had 0.9 percent more sugar and less water in its composition than US-graded. One grade of syrup not for table use, called commercial or Grade C, was also produced under the Vermont system.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic ingredient in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar maple or various other species of maple trees. It consists primarily of sucrose and water, with small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the invert sugar created in the boiling process.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 100g amount, maple syrup provides 260 calories and is composed of 32 percent water by weight, 67 percent carbohydrates (90 percent of which are sugars), and no appreciable protein or fat (table). Maple syrup is generally low in overall micronutrient content, although manganese and riboflavin are at high levels along with moderate amounts of zinc and calcium (right table). It also contains trace amounts of amino acids which increase in content as sap flow occurs.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple syrup contains a wide variety of volatile organic compounds, including vanillin, hydroxybutanone, and propionaldehyde. It is not yet known exactly what compounds are responsible for maple syrup's distinctive flavour,[32] however its primary flavour contributing compounds are maple furanone, strawberry furanone, and maltol.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew compounds have been identified in maple syrup, one of which is quebecol, a natural phenolic compound created when the maple sap is boiled to create syrup.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne author described maple syrup as \\"a unique ingredient, smooth- and silky-textured, with a sweet, distinctive flavour ÿ hints of caramel with overtones of toffee will not do ÿ and a rare colour, amber set alight. Maple flavour is, well, maple flavour, uniquely different from any other.\\"[44] Agriculture Canada has developed a \\"flavour wheel\\" that details 91 unique flavours that can be present in maple syrup. These flavours are divided into 13 families: vanilla, empyreumatic (burnt), milky, fruity, floral, spicy, foreign (deterioration or fermentation), foreign (environment), maple, confectionery, plant (herbaceous), plant (forest, humus or cereals), and plant (ligneous).[71][72] These flavours are evaluated using a procedure similar to wine tasting.[73] Other culinary experts praise its unique flavour.[74][75][76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple syrup and its various artificial imitations are widely used as toppings for pancakes, waffles, and French toast in North America. They can also be used to flavour a variety of foods, including fritters, ice cream, hot cereal, fresh fruit, and sausages. It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, candied sweet potatoes, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies. Maple syrup can also be used as a replacement for honey in wine (mead).[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, maple syrup must be made entirely from maple sap, and syrup must have a density of 66 on the Brix scale to be marketed as maple syrup.[31] In the United States, maple syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap, although small amounts of substances such as salt may be added.[79] Labeling laws prohibit imitation syrups from having \\"maple\\" in their names unless the finished product contains 10 percent or more of natural maple syrup.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Maple-flavoured\\" syrups include maple syrup, but may contain additional ingredients.[79] \\"Pancake syrup\\", \\"waffle syrup\\", \\"table syrup\\", and similarly named syrups are substitutes which are less expensive than maple syrup. In these syrups, the primary ingredient is most often high-fructose corn syrup flavoured with sotolon; they have little genuine maple content, and are usually thickened above the viscosity of maple syrup.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nImitation syrups are generally cheaper than maple syrup, with less natural flavour.[80] In the United States, consumers generally prefer imitation syrups, likely because of the significantly lower cost and sweeter flavour;[81][82] they typically cost about $8 per gallon (1 US gallon (3,800?ml)), whereas authentic maple syrup costs $40 to $60 per gallon (2015 prices).[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, maple syrup producers from nine US states petitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate labeling of products containing maple syrup or using the word \\"maple\\" in manufactured products, indicating that imitation maple products contained insignificant amounts of natural maple syrup.[83] In September 2016, the FDA published a consumer advisory to carefully inspect the ingredient list of products labeled as \\"maple\\".[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple products are considered emblematic of Canada, in particular Quebec, and are frequently sold in tourist shops and airports as souvenirs from Canada. The sugar maple's leaf has come to symbolize Canada, and is depicted on the country's flag.[85] Several US states, including West Virginia, New York, Vermont and Wisconsin, have the sugar maple as their state tree.[86] A scene of sap collection is depicted on the Vermont state quarter, issued in 2001.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaple syrup and maple sugar were used during the American Civil War and by abolitionists in the years before the war because most cane sugar and molasses were produced by Southern slaves.[81][88] Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and maple sugar,[16] and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.[89]","input":"What trees do you get maple syrup from?"},{"output":"Wayne Nelson","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle River Band (LRB) are a rock band originally formed in Melbourne, Australia, in March 1975. The band achieved commercial success in both Australia and the United States. They have sold more than 30 million records; six studio albums reached the top?10 on the Australian Kent Music Report albums chart including Diamantina Cocktail (April 1977) and First Under the Wire (July 1979), which both peaked at No.?2. Nine singles appeared in the top?20 on the related singles chart, with  \\"Help Is on Its Way\\" (1977) as their only number-one hit. Ten singles reached the top?20 on the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Reminiscing\\" their highest, peaking at No.?3. Only First Under the Wire appeared in the top?10 albums on the Billboard 200.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly members were Beeb Birtles, Ric Formosa, Graeham Goble, Roger McLachlan, Derek Pellicci and Glenn Shorrock. Most of the group's 1970s and 1980s material was written by Goble and/or Shorrock, Birtles and David Briggs (who replaced Formosa).\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle River Band have received many music awards in Australia. In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th anniversary celebrations, named \\"Cool Change\\", written by Shorrock, as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. The 1976 line-up of Birtles, Briggs, Goble, Pellicci, Shorrock and George McArdle (who replaced McLachlan), were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame at the 18th Annual ARIA Music Awards of 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle River Band have undergone numerous personnel changes, with over 30 members since their formation. None of the musicians now performing as Little River Band are original members, nor did they contribute to the success the band had in the 1970s. In the 1980s, members included John Farnham, David Hirschfelder, Stephen Housden, Wayne Nelson and Steve Prestwich. Currently the line-up is Nelson with Rich Herring, Chris Marion, Ryan Ricks and Colin Whinnery, none of whom are Australian. The band website is blocked to Australia. Two former members have died, Barry Sullivan in October 2003 (aged 57) and Steve Prestwich in January 2011 (aged 56).\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle River Band was formed in March 1975 in Melbourne as a harmony rock group with Glenn Shorrock on lead vocals, Beeb Birtles on guitar and vocals, Graeham Goble on guitar and vocals, Derek Pellicci on drums and session players Graham Davidge on lead guitar and Dave Orams on bass guitar.[1][2][3] Upon formation they were an Australian super group, with Birtles, Goble, Pellicci and Shorrock each from prominent local bands.[4] Birtles had been the bass guitarist in the 1960s pop-rock band Zoot (which launched the career of singer-guitarist Rick Springfield).[1][2] Goble had led Adelaide-formed folk rock group Allison Gros before forming the harmony country rock band  Mississippi (joined by Birtles and Pellicci) which had chart success in Australia and built up a strong following on the concert and festival circuit. During 1971ÿ72 the original members of Mississippi also recorded as a studio band under the pseudonym Drummond.[5] They achieved a number-one hit, for eight consecutive weeks, on the Go-Set National Top?40 with a novelty cover version of the Rays' song \\"Daddy Cool\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nShorrock had been the lead singer of a 1960s pop band, the Twilights, and an early 1970s country rock group, Axiom (alongside singer-songwriter Brian Cadd).[1][2] Both Axiom and Mississippi had tried to break into the United Kingdom record market without success.[1][2] Axiom disbanded after moving to the UK, and Shorrock sang for a short period with a more progressive rock outfit, Esperanto.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974 Birtles, Goble, Pellicci and Shorrock met in London with Glenn Wheatley (ex bass player -The Masters Apprentices).[1][2][3] With Wheatley as manager, they agreed to reconvene in Melbourne in early 1975.[3] Due to the indifferent reception they had each received in the UK, they decided their new band would establish itself in the United States.[1][3] Wheatley's first-hand experiences of the rip-offs in the 1960s music scene, combined with his experience working in music management in the UK and the US in the early 1970s, allowed him to help the Little River Band become the first Australian group to enjoy consistent commercial and chart success in the US.[1][3][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter their return to Australia, the members began rehearsing in February 1975, still using the name of Mississippi. In Wheatley's autobiography, Paper Paradise (1999), he described how they obtained their name: \\"It was now time to get out of the rehearsal room and play to a live audience ÿ somewhere without any fanfare, somewhere out of the way. I booked the Golfview Hotel in Geelong for the Saturday night of 1 March 1975. While travelling to the venue down the Geelong Road from Melbourne, we passed the turn-off for Little River. From the back of the truck, Glenn Shorrock shouted, 'What about the Little River Band'? And so, that night the Golfview Hotel witnessed the first performance of the Little River Band, albeit advertised on the marquee as Mississippi.\\"[8] On 20 March 1975 they played their first official gig under their new name at Martini's Hotel in Carlton.[9] They played a return gig at the Golfview Hotel five days later.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle River Band had recorded their first track, a cover version of the Everly Brothers' song \\"When Will I Be Loved\\" in February 1975,[1] at Armstrong Studios, but Linda Ronstadt's version appeared in March 1975 ÿ so LRB did not release theirs.[3] Before the group began playing concerts, Graham Davidge was replaced by Ric Formosa on guitar, and Dave Orams by Roger McLachlan on bass guitar and backing vocals.[8][1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was guitarist Phil Manning, formerly of the band Chain, that was LRB's first choice for lead guitar duties. Manning was busy cultivating a solo career so he recommended Ric Formosa to Wheatley. Formosa had recently travelled to Australia from Canada and working in a music store. He was asked to audition and received a phone call soon after with an invitation to join the band. [11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1975 they signed with EMI Records and started recording their debut self-titled album (November 1975) at Armstrong Studios in June. The album was co-produced by Birtles, Goble, Shorrock and Wheatley.[2] Tony Catterall of The Canberra Times described it as \\"one of those flawed creations that inevitably draws a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger response.\\"[12] Little River Band peaked at No.?17 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart.[13] Their debut single, \\"Curiosity (Killed the Cat)\\", had appeared in September, reaching No.?15 on the related Kent Music Report Singles Chart.[13] Two more singles followed, \\"Emma\\" (January 1976) and \\"It's a Long Way There\\" (November 1976).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nWheatley had travelled to Los Angeles in December 1975 and touted the group to various record companies until Rupert Perry of Capitol Records signed them on Christmas Eve.[8] Little River Band issued their second album, After Hours, in May 1976 on EMI. It was produced by the band but was not issued in the US until 1980 and then first as a CD in 1997 on One Way Records, with three bonus tracks.[1][2] After Hours peaked at No.?5 and provided the single \\"Everyday of My Life\\", in May, which reached the top?30.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring August 1976, both Formosa and McLachlan were replaced: David Briggs joined on guitar (ex-Cycle, The Avengers, Ram Band) and George McArdle on bass guitar (also ex-Ram Band).[1][2][14] Formosa (according to Wheatley's aforementioned book) not enthusiastic about touring outside of Australia, left the group to pursue other musical interests, working as a session musician and as a composer and arranger. And at the same time, the group decided to also replace bassist Roger McLachlan, who also became a sessions player and subsequently joined the Australian country rock group Stars[2][15][16] Formosa remained in touch with LRB: he conducted and wrote string parts for several tracks on subsequent albums.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nEncouraged by their Australian success, the band undertook their first international tour.[1] They flew to the UK on 17 September 1976 to play a show in London's Hyde Park supporting Queen. They then opened shows in the rest of Europe for the Hollies during September and October.[1][3] Birtles advised fellow Australian bands that \\"It's so much easier when you have a product to sell... And the money you make on the club circuit in Australia while establishing yourself is better than anything you can make in Britain, where there is so much competition.\\"[18] In October 1976 they performed their first US concert, at James Madison University (then called Madison College) in Harrisonburg, Virginia, as the opening act for Average White Band.[1][3] Due to their US appearances and support from FM stations, \\"It's a Long Way There\\" reached No.?28 on the Billboard Hot 100.[19] This galvanised the commitment of the band members to tackle the US record market.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle River Band's second album, After Hours, was passed over in the US by Capitol. The label selected tracks from it and from their third Australian one, Diamantina Cocktail (April 1977), to create Capitol's second US album, also titled Diamantina Cocktail (June 1977).[1][2] The Australian version was co-produced by the group with John Boylan ÿ who stayed on to co-produce their next two studio albums.[2] During the recording there were \\"frictions and competition between the band members\\" such that Birtles, Goble and Shorrock each \\"recorded separately in the studio... as much as possible.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canberra Times' Julie Meldrum caught their performance in May 1977, which \\"moved along at a rapid pace and slowed down only once with a few laid-back tracks towards the middle of the set\\" and they were \\"tightly disciplined musicians. All the instruments were played clearly and it was obvious that collectively or individually there was nothing that was not world class.\\"[20] Meldrum also reviewed the album, which had \\"no references to Australia and it is obvious that the band is trying to ensconce itself in the Los Angeles scene... [its] most dominating influences are David Crosby and Graham Nash, and Little Feat.\\"[21] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt the US release was \\"laidback, sweet country-rock, the album has a similar sound to the band's debut, but the melodies are a little sharper and catchier, making the album a better, more fully-rounded collection.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia Diamantina Cocktail became their highest charting album, peaking at No.?2;[13] the US version reached the top?50 on the Billboard 200.[19] In January 1978 it was certified gold by RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies;[23] and they were the first Australian band to do so.[1] The lead single, \\"Help Is on Its Way\\" reached No.?1 in Australia.[13] Both it and the fourth single, \\"Happy Anniversary\\", peaked in the top?20 on the US Hot 100.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1977 the group toured consistently, mostly in the US, headlining in smaller venues, and appearing in stadiums on larger multi-billed shows supporting The Doobie Brothers, Supertramp and America.[1] In August 1977 they co-headlined day two of the Reading Music Festival alongside Thin Lizzy.[24] In November Little River Band supported Fleetwood Mac and Santana at the Rockarena concerts in Sydney and Melbourne.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir fourth studio album, Sleeper Catcher (May 1978), peaked at No.?4 in Australia and No.?16 in the US.[13][19] By May in the following year it was certified platinum by RIAA for sales of 1,000,000 copies,[23] and was the first Australian recorded album to achieve that feat.[3] AllMusic's Mike DeGagne praised Shorrock's vocals, which give the album \\"the perfect MOR sound, draping the tracks with his cool, breezy style that is much more apparent and effectual here than on the band's earlier efforts.\\"[26] Sleeper Catcher provided four singles with \\"Shut Down Turn Off\\" (April 1978) their highest charting in Australia at No.?16,[13] however in the US the highest charting was \\"Reminiscing\\" (June 1978), which peaked at No.?3.[19] The album's last single, \\"Lady\\" (December 1978), reached No.?10 in the US in early 1979.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Pellicci was hospitalised in May 1978 due to severe burns from an exploding gas grill cylinder, Geoff Cox (ex-Brian Cadd, Bootleg Family Band, Avalanche) substituted on drums, rather than the group cancelling shows for their next US tour.[1][27] On that tour they supported Boz Scaggs, Jimmy Buffett and the Eagles.[1][27] Cox remained with the group through mid-1978 and played alongside Pellicci, after the latter joined the tour at a show supporting the Eagles at C.N.E. Stadium in Toronto on 6 August 1978, until he was healed enough to continue on his own. Mal Logan (ex-the Dingoes, Rene Geyer Band) joined on keyboards for another US tour which began in late December 1978. Logan stayed on as their touring keyboardist through the end of 1981.[1][2][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy February 1978 \\"frictions inside the band continued to brew, relieved a little by a sideline album\\".[3] Birtles & Goble was a side project formed as a duo to showcase their tracks rejected for LRB releases.[1][2][3] They issued three singles, \\"Lonely Lives\\" (March 1978), \\"I'm Coming Home\\" (March 1979) and \\"How I Feel Tonight\\" (June 1980) and an album, The Last Romance (May 1980).[1][2][3] \\"I'm Coming Home\\" reached No.?8 in Australia.[13] Shorrock had a solo single with a cover version of Bobby Darin's \\"Dream Lover\\" (April 1979), which reached the Australian top?10.[1][13][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst Under the Wire was issued as LRB's fifth studio album in July 1979, which reached No.?2 in Australia ÿ equal highest position with Diamantina Cocktail.[13] It was also their highest charting album on the Billboard 200 ÿ reaching No.?10.[19] In November 1979 it was certified by RIAA as a platinum album.[23] AllMusic's Mark Allan described how, with their \\"mix of harmony-drenched pop tunes and unthreatening rockers, they appealed to a wide audience.\\"[30] Both singles, \\"Lonesome Loser\\" (July 1979) and \\"Cool Change\\" (October 1979) peaked in the US top?10.[19] Briggs wrote \\"Lonesome Loser\\" and Shorrock wrote \\"Cool Change\\".[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcArdle left in late January 1979 to enrol in a Bible college and became a Christian minister.[32] In July of that year Barry Sullivan (ex-Chain, Rene Geyer Band) took over on bass guitar.[1][28] He was replaced, in turn, by Wayne Nelson (ex-Jim Messina Band), later LRB's lead singer, who joined in April 1980.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group's two 1980 Australian live releases, Backstage Pass and Live in America, were released in the US as a double set, also called Backstage Pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoble was also the producer for Australian pop singer John Farnham's solo album, Uncovered (September 1980).[2] Goble wrote or co-wrote nine of its ten tracks and provided vocals. Other LRB alumni used were Briggs, Formosa, Logan, Nelson, Pellicci and Sullivan.[2][33] Farnham had signed with Wheatley's management company.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe line-up of Birtles, Briggs, Goble, Nelson, Pellicci and Shorrock recorded Little River Band's sixth studio album,[35] Time Exposure (August 1981), in Montserrat with George Martin (the Beatles) producing.[1][2][3] The Canberra Times' Garry Raffaele felt that the \\"essence of it all is that it's easy listening, no demands, easing up, slowing down, getting older.\\"[36] By the time it had appeared, Stephen Housden (ex-Stevie Wright Band, the Imports) replaced Briggs on lead guitar.[1][2] It reached No?.9 in Australia and No.?21 in the US;[13][19] and in November it was certified gold by RIAA.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August Nelson provided lead vocals for Time Exposure's lead single, \\"The Night Owls\\", which peaked at No.?18 in Australia and No.?6 in the US.[13][19] Raffaele described the track as \\"the\\r\\npunchiest thing LRB has done for some time but it's still middle-of-the-road pap, hummable.\\"[36] Nelson also shared vocal duties with Shorrock on the second single, \\"Take It Easy on Me\\" (November 1981).[1][3][10] According to Australian music journalist Ed Nimmervoll, Nelson's presence was \\"adding to the problems within the band\\"; Nimmervoll opined that Goble \\"agitated within the band to replace Glenn Shorrock with John Farnham.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1982 Shorrock left Little River Band and resumed his solo career but did not achieve chart success in the US.[10] Farnham replaced Shorrock on lead vocals[37] and \\"Man on Your Mind\\", the third single from Time Exposure (with Shorrock's vocals), reached No.?14 in the US.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his 2017 autobiography, Every Day of My Life, Beeb Birtles described the parting of ways with Shorrock and Briggs, \\"David's confidence had escalated to the extent where he became adamant about what needed to be done. I remember a couple of embarrassing moments in the studio where he was quite rude to George Martin, insisting that his way was better and that he didn't need to be told how or what to play. After our return from recording in Montserrat, during a meeting at Glenn Wheatley's house, Graeham was quite vocal about David's conduct. He confronted Dave and virtually fired him. With Glenn, I would go overboard trying to please him but rarely got anything back from him. I found him hard to read at times as he's a man of few words. After he took his frustration out on me one day during a rehearsal, I spoke my mind and told him in no uncertain terms how I felt and in a meeting with Glenn, Graeham and Wheatley, I said I couldn't work with Glenn anymore. Graeham, who had always been at opposite poles to Shorrock, agreed with me and Wheatley started freaking out saying he thought it was a big mistake. What was Capital Records going to say? But in hindsight, I believe he was right on the money and to me this would be the mistake that cut Little River Band's throat.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1982 Farnham told Susan Moore of The Australian Women's Weekly, \\"Fitting in with the guys hasn't been hard, they have made it so easy for me... But recording and on stage things are quite different from what I've been used to.\\"[37] On covering the previous LRB repertoire he said, \\"We've had to change the key with a lot of things because Glenn sang in a different register from me.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first single with Farnham as lead vocalist, \\"The Other Guy\\" (one of two new offerings on their Greatest Hits album), was released in November 1982, which reached No.?18 in Australia and No.?11 in the US.[13][19] The other track, \\"Down on the Border\\", peaked at No.?7 in Australia.[13] The next single, \\"We Two\\", from their seventh studio album, The Net (May 1983), reached No.?22 in the US.[19] It had been co-produced by the group and Ernie Rose (Mississippi, Rnee Geyer, Stars).[2][38] DeGagne reviewed the album, which \\"failed to capture the same success they experienced with Shorrock at the helm. The same type of soft rock fluidity and laid-back charm has been replaced with a sound that seems forced and somewhat strained.\\"[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1983 \\"You're Driving Me Out of My Mind\\" became the group's last single to reach the US Top?40.[39] The band moved towards a more 1980s style sound and added a keyboardist, David Hirschfelder (ex-Peter Cupples Band, who had earlier in the year guested on The Net and at some of LRB's shows), in September 1983.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pressures of success and constant touring took their toll on the band as line-up changes continued. Birtles left in October because he did not like the harder, more progressive musical path that Goble was taking the group and because he had preferred Shorrock's vocals.[10] Birtles contributed to soundtracks for feature films, From Something Great (1985) and Boulevard of Broken Dreams (1988);[1][2] he also worked as a session musician, eventually relocating to the US and releasing a solo album, Driven By Dreams, in 2000.[2][40] Pellicci left in February 1984 for similar reasons and Steve Prestwich (ex-Cold Chisel) was his replacement on drums.[1][2] Pellicci also became a session musician: including working for Brian Cadd.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir eighth studio album, Playing to Win, was released in January 1985, which delivered a harder sound with producer Spencer Proffer.[2] The change in sound, along with the unofficial shortening of their name to LRB, confused fans and radio programmers. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane felt it was \\"a strong album but it failed to halt the band's slide in popularity.\\"[1] It reached No.?38 in Australia and No.?75 on the US charts.[13][19] It is the group's last charting album on the Billboard 200.[19] The title track made No.?59 on the Australian singles chart, No.?15 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and No.?60 on Hot?100.[13][19][41] The second single, \\"Blind Eyes\\", failed to enter the charts.[13][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1985 Little River Band performed for the Oz for Africa benefit concert (part of the global Live Aid program) including: \\"Don't Blame Me\\", \\"Full Circle\\", \\"Night Owls\\", and \\"Playing to Win\\". They were broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US. American Broadcasting Company broadcast \\"Don't Blame Me\\" and \\"Night Owls\\" during their Live Aid telecast (\\"Night Owls\\" was only partially transmitted).[42] Farnham left the group following the completion of their short Australian tour in April 1986, which had Malcolm Wakeford drumming in Prestwich's place.[43] Their ninth studio album, No Reins, recorded when Farnham was still aboard, appeared in May 1986 and was produced by Richard Dodd.[2] It reached the Kent Music Report top?100.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nFarnham explained to Pollyanna Sutton of The Canberra Times why he left, \\"I was up front and had to be the most liked. There was a lot of pressure because it wasn't, perhaps, working as it should, although there were other contributing things like the membership changes and perhaps the material.\\"[44] Nimmervoll wrote of the Farnham years, \\"The experiment had never worked. Whatever John's talents, America longed for Glenn Shorrock. At the end of 1985, while LRB was seriously contemplating its future, Farnham took the initiative to start work on another solo album.\\"[3] Farnham continued to be managed by Wheatley ÿ who had also left LRB ÿ and his solo career took off with his next album, Whispering Jack (October 1986).[1][2][3] Hirschfelder, McLachlan, Nelson and Pellicci contributed to the album or the related tour.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Farnham's departure, Little River Band were essentially in limbo until 1987 when Pellicci and Shorrock returned at the request of Irving Azoff, the head of MCA Records, who wanted the band on his label.[45] The line-up of Goble, Housden, Nelson, Pellicci and Shorrock established a holding company, We Two Pty. Ltd, with all members as directors in equal share.[10][46] In July 1988 Pellicci described the albums after he had left LRB: \\"It was an overstatement to say the response to No Reins and Playing to Win was lukewarm  there was no response at all.\\"[47] The revamped Little River Band, augmented by keyboardist James Roche,  performed at the opening of World Expo 88 in Brisbane on 30 April, where they were joined by the Eagles' Glenn Frey, who accompanied them that year on tour.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group released their tenth studio album, Monsoon, on MCA in June 1988, which peaked at No.?9 on the Kent Music Report and at No.?13 on the ARIA Albums Chart in Australia.[13][49] It was co-produced by Boylan and Goble.[2] The Canberra Times' Lisa Wallace was disappointed, \\"I fear the album may not live up to expectations... I was one of the silly ones who expected something more, something new... Pleasant it is, technically precise and solid-gold Top 40 stuff, but nothing's changed. The band is no better, and no worse, than it was all those years ago.\\"[50] Its lead single, \\"Love Is a Bridge\\", co-written by Goble and Housden was released in May and peaked at No.?7 on the Kent Music Report and at No.?11 on the ARIA Singles Chart.[13][49][51] It was their second highest charting single in the Australian market,[1] and a moderate Adult Contemporary radio hit in the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989 the group recorded the Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg song \\"Listen to Your Heart\\" for the movie The Karate Kid Part III.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eleventh studio album, Get Lucky (February 1990), made the top?60 in Australia ÿ their last charting studio album in Australia.[13][49] Mike Boehm of Los Angeles Times caught their gig in May, where \\"Lead singer Glenn Shorrock was stiff and seemed stuck for words between songs. But he knew what to do when the music started, singing in a comfortably husky voice that resembled Phil Collins in tone and easy pop appeal. Wayne Nelson, the group's Californian, generated more heat in his two lead vocal turns. The three-part harmonies behind Shorrock were exemplary, although the CS&N parallels were unmistakable. Lead guitarist Stephen Housden reinforced the emphasis on melody with his clean, lyrical lines.\\"[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nMCA released a compilation album, Worldwide Love, of tracks from the previous two LPs on their Curb Records imprint in June 1991. Both Get Lucky and Worldwide Love peaked in the top?40 on the Swiss Hitparade;[53] with the latter album also appearing on the ?3 Austria Top 40.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nGoble had ceased touring with the group in 1989 and left altogether by 1992[1] as well as signing away his rights to the band's name.[55] Peter Beckett (ex-Player) joined in 1989 to take Goble's place in the line-up. The group went through a series of keyboard players, including Tony Sciuto (1990ÿ1992, 1993ÿ1997) and Richart Bryant (1992ÿ1993, ex-Doobie Brothers).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1992 the daughter of bassist Nelson was killed in a traffic collision in San Diego, while her father was on tour with the band in Europe.[56] Nelson immediately returned home and Hal Tupea substituted on bass for the November 1993 New Zealand dates of the band's tour.[57][58] Little River Band subsequently took a break until Nelson's return in 1994 and embarked on a four-and-a-half month 20th Anniversary US tour in 1995.[59][57]\\r\\n\\r\\nShorrock left again in 1996; he was offered the option to buy out the remaining members of We Two Pty. Ltd[60] He took a one-third share of the monetary value of the company as he did not want to commit to the band's US touring schedule. Shorrock was replaced on lead vocals by Melbourne singer Steve Wade (ex-Dolphin Street).[1][2] Nelson also left in 1996 and Hal Tupea returned on bass guitar.[2] This line-up lasted until late 1997, when everyone, except Wade, started to leave, including Pellicci, who left again early in 1998.[1][2][3] The departure of all original members left Housden as the sole owner of We Two Pty. Ltd and the Little River Band trademark.[46][55][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998 Housden re-established Little River Band with Wade and new contracted members Paul Gildea on vocals and guitars; Kevin Murphy on vocals, drums and percussion; and Adrian Scott on vocals and keyboards (ex-Air Supply) and brought back Roger McLachlan, who returned after 22 years, on bass guitar.[1][2] McLachlan's second tenure was short lived; both he and Scott departed after a year, not accustomed to the band's touring schedule. Nelson returned in early 1999 and Glenn Reither joined on keyboards, sax and backing vocals. Gildea and Wade left next in early 2000 with Australian Greg Hind joining on vocals and guitars and Nelson taking over as lead singer. The line-up of Hind, Housden, Nelson, Murphy and Reither recorded two studio albums, Where We Started From (November 2000) and Test of Time (June 2004).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2002 Birtles Shorrock Goble were formed as a soft rock trio, initially as \\"The Original Little River Band\\" or \\"The Voices of Little River Band\\"; They undertook a series of reunion concerts performing the group's earlier material.[55][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2002 a legal dispute over the use of the name \\"Little River Band\\" reached the Federal Court of Australia. We Two Pty. Ltd., Little River Band's parent company since 1988, lodged an action against Birtles, Goble, Shorrock and Wheatley seeking an injunction to stop the respondents from using the Little River Band trademarks and common law marks, or anything deceptively similar, as a trademark or band name.[62] The Little River Band Pty. Ltd. counterclaimed, seeking the removal of the Little River Band trademark for non-use and return of the trademarks to The Little River Band Pty. Ltd. based on a claim of prior ownership.[62] The matter was heard before Justice Finkelstein. When We Two was able to provide undisputed evidence of their use of the trademark during the statutory period, The Little River Band Pty. Ltd. withdrew their crossclaim and Birtles, Shorrock, Goble and Wheatley sought a settlement with We Two.[62] Documentation showing the assignment of the Little River Band trademarks to We Two, registered by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1989,[63] and Birtles' transfer of ownership of the url \\"littleriverband.com\\"  to We Two in 2000 were presented during the hearing.[64] When asked to produce the documention on television in 2015, Housden stated: \\"I have the signatures somewhere at home. I have a photocopy of it but I couldn't find it today to show up on the screen.\\"[65] Of the same court case former band manager Glenn Wheatley said: \\"I can't even remember signing that document that was presented in court. On the last day, all of a sudden, this photocopy of a document that had my name on it - signature.\\"[65] The parties reached a settlement on 13 June 2002 with their agreement that We Two had ownership of the Little River Band trademark and common law marks including the name, logo, \\"LRB\\" and the platypus logo and that Birtles, Goble, Shorrock and Wheatley could reference their past history with the band in advertising separate to their band name and only in a descriptive manner.[61][66][62] The matter of costs was decided by Justice Finkelstein on 12 July 2002. An order was made for Birtles, Goble, Shorrock and Wheatley to pay one half of We Two's taxed costs.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nA further legal case, which was also settled out of court in mid-2005, allowed the trio to advertise their Little River Band connection but not to perform under that name.[67] Goble, Birtles and Shorrock have shared their frustration through song; Goble recorded \\"Someone's Taken Our History\\",[68] Birtles recorded \\"Revolving Door\\"[69] and Shorrock put forth \\"Hear My Voice\\".[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of 2004, Murphy and Reither left the current version of LRB and Chris Marion joined on keyboards, while Kip Raines temporarily took on drumming duties until replaced by Billy Thomas in early 2005. Housden left the touring band in 2006, although he still participates in the band's recordings and management. Rich Herring took over lead guitar on tour and Mel Watts replaced Thomas, who had suffered a shoulder injury, on drums in 2007. Ryan Ricks subsequently replaced Watts in 2012. The latter day lineup continued to play tracks written by Birtles, Goble and/or Shorrock as well as newer material.\\r\\n\\r\\nA review of Little River Band was posted in February 2013 on the Leigh Valley music page when the band toured Pennsylvania. Reviewer John Moser wrote: \\"Little River Band played the hits, for sure, in a 14-song, 75-minute show. Not a single one of the songs it played was released after 1985. But when it tried to update the songs, which was often, it diminished them, and when it tried to play them true to the originals, it fell short.\\"[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2013 the current line-up of LRB, Nelson, Hind, Marion, Herring and Ricks, put out the album Cuts Like a Diamond on the Frontiers Music Srl label.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn appearance by Little River Band, scheduled for 12 January 2015 on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, was cancelled after complaints from earlier members concerning its promotion as a 40th anniversary performance.[72] Permission for any songs written by Birtles, Briggs, Goble or Shorrock was refused.[73] \\"We've just had enough of it,\\" Shorrock said. \\"They've been living off our coat-tails for years.\\"[74] \\"They are promoting a newly recorded album of their own material, or whatever material they have got. They should do that rather than pretend they are the band that sold 30 million albums.\\"[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a Facebook announcement titled \\"Does the truth hurt?\\" on 19 January 2015, current keyboardist Chris Marion offered his side of the story and exclaimed; \\"Heck, Ive now been in the band longer than Beeb Birtles.\\"[76] Little River Band founding member and hit songwriter Graeham Goble responded \\"LRB's current keys player Chris Marions Facebook rant is full of inaccuracies, too many for me to address. I just want to make one retort, concerning his comment that hes now been in LRB longer than Beeb Birtles. As if length of tenure is any claim to talent or anything. Beeb has a timbre to his voice & a vocal harmony talent that maybe 5 guys in music history can equal. I say the same about Glenn Shorrocks voice. There are millions of Chris Marions in this World and five of them are in the current touring LRB.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2015 an appearance by the group in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, was cancelled after the venue received a cease and desist order from the earlier members regarding the use of their recordings in advertising and the subsequent demands of the present line-up to be paid in full before performing. The venue described this demand as \\"not only unreasonable, but uncustomary\\".[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2015 the controversy over use of the name Little River Band was featured in the Australian current affairs program Sunday Night.[79][80][81] Housden, the legal owner of the Little River Band name, told the Sunday Night program that he would not allow the original members to perform as Little River Band \\"in this lifetime\\".[75][82]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2015, Little River Band were named as \\"Casino Musical Entertainer of the Year\\" at the Annual G2E Awards ceremony at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2017, the Little River Band continued to tour, mostly in the US, performing more than 80 concerts annually,[84] re-recording the original members' material[85] and using original members' images and recordings in promotional material.[86] The current lineup's press releases recount the original members' achievements and awards as if they were their own.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen asked about the Hits Revisited album, founding member Beeb Birtles said \\"That to me is the comedy album ... \\"They re-arranged all the songs and it's bloody awful. They're nothing more than a tribute band.\\"[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017 Little River Band blocked all of Australia from viewing its website. They cited Russia and Africa as also being blocked for \\"different reasons\\".[89][90]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 November 2017, founding member Beeb Birtles was interviewed on Australian news program Studio 10. When asked if the original band would ever reunite he said; \\"I don't think that's going to happen. We can't do it without the name, that's the problem. We played some shows as Birtles, Shorrock, Goble and had some success with that. Once that folded we all realised it wasn't going to go any further than that. It's unfortunate how we lost the name and everything, but if its ruled in the court that way all you can do is walk away from it.\\"[91] Shorrock offered to bury the hatchet in 2015 saying \\"Let's get up on stage and play some music.

The first recorded record transfer was of Willie Groves from West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa for S100 in 1893. This occurred just eight years after the introduction of professionalism by The FA in 1885.[1] The current transfer record was set by the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain for ?222 million (S198 million) on 3 August 2017.[2][3][4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the highest-value transfers on this list are to clubs under UEFA's jurisdiction, and most of the purchasing clubs are from England, Spain, Italy and France.

Due to exchange rate fluctuations the order is different in pound sterling, which are also shown in the table. Transfers that took place before the adoption of the euro are given in their approximate euro equivalent. The list includes only the top fifty disclosed transfer fees.\\r\\nThree players appear on the list twice: Neymar, James Rodriguez and ngel Di Mara. All of the players on the list are of either European (UEFA) or South American (CONMEBOL) origin. There are no players from the remaining regions, namely Africa (CAF), Asia (AFC), North America (CONCACAF) and Oceania (OFC).\\r\\nAs of 1 September 2017; after the 2017 summer transfer window.\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nThe first player to ever be transferred for a fee of over S100 was Scottish striker Willie Groves when he together with Jack Reynolds (S50) made the switch from West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa in 1893,[136] eight years after the legalisation of professionalism in the sport. It took just twelve years for the figure to become S1000, when Sunderland striker Alf Common moved to Middlesbrough.[137][138]\\r\\nIt was not until 1928 that the first five-figure transfer took place. David Jack of Bolton Wanderers was the subject of interest from Arsenal, and in order to negotiate the fee down, Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman got the Bolton representatives drunk.[139][140] Subsequently, David Jack was transferred for a world record fee when Arsenal paid S10,890 to Bolton for his services, after Bolton had asked for S13,000, which was double the previous record made when Sunderland signed Burnley's Bob Kelly a fee of for S6,500.[138]\\r\\nThe first player from outside Great Britain to break the record was Bernab Ferreyra, a player known as La Fiera for his powerful shot. His 1932 transfer from Tigre to River Plate cost S23k,[140] and the record would last for 17 years (the longest the record has lasted) until it was broken by Manchester United's sale of Johnny Morris to Derby County for S24k in March 1949. The record was broken seven further times between 1949 and 1961, when Luis Surez Miramontes was sold by FC Barcelona to Inter Milan for S152k, becoming the first ever player sold for more than S100k.[138]\\r\\nIn 1968, Pietro Anastasi became the first S500k player when Juventus purchased him from Varese,[140] which was followed seven years later with Giuseppe Savoldi becoming the first million pound player when he transferred from Bologna to Napoli.[138][140]\\r\\nThe second player to twice be transferred for world record fees is Diego Maradona.[138][140] His transfers from Boca Juniors to Barcelona for S3m, and then to Napoli for S5m, both broke the record in 1982 and 1984 respectively. The third became Ronaldo with his record-breaking move from PSV Eindhoven to Barcelona in 1996 for S13.2m, although Alan Shearer's transfer to Newcastle broke the record the same summer. A year later Inter Milan paid S19.5m for Ronaldo and again he became the player with the highest transfer fee.\\r\\nIn the space of 61 days in 1992,[140] three transfers broke the record,[138] all by Italian clubs: Jean-Pierre Papin transferred from Marseille to A.C. Milan, becoming the first ever S10m player.[140] Almost immediately, rivals Juventus topped that with the signing of Gianluca Vialli for a fee of S12m from Sampdoria. Milan then completed the signing of Gianluigi Lentini for a fee of S13m which stood as the record for three years.\\r\\nThe 1996 transfer of Alan Shearer from Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United, for a fee of S15m,[141] kickstarted a year-by-year succession of record breaking transfers: Ronaldo moved the following year to Inter Milan from FC Barcelona for a fee of S17m,[142] which was followed in 1998 by the shock transfer of his fellow countryman Denlson from S?o Paulo to Real Betis for a fee of approximately S21m.[138][140][143]\\r\\nIn 1999 and 2000, Italian clubs returned to their record-breaking ways, with Christian Vieri transferring from Lazio to Inter Milan for S28m,[144] while Hernn Crespo's transfer from Parma to Lazio ensured he became the first player to cost more than S30m.[138][145] The transfer prompted the BBC to ask \\"has the world gone mad\\"?[146] It took two weeks for the record to be broken when Lus Figo made a controversial S37m move from Barcelona to rivals Real Madrid.[138][147] A year later, Real increased the record again with a signing of Zinedine Zidane for S48 million (150 billion lire).[148]\\r\\nZidane's record stood for 8 years, the longest since the 1940s. Real Madrid continued with the Galcticos policy by buying Kak from Milan for ?67?million (S56 million),[149] which was the world record in pound sterling. However, both world record in euro and in pound sterling were broke by Real themselves when signing Cristiano Ronaldo for S80m (?94m) from Manchester United in the same transfer window,[138][150] 4 years later Real Madrid broke the record again after completed the signing of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013. Although Real initially insisted that the transfer cost ?91.59 million, slightly less than the Ronaldo fee, the deal was widely reported to be around ?100 million (around S85.1 million).[151][152] Documents leaked in 2016 by Football Leaks revealed that installments brought the final Bale fee up to a total of ?100,759,418.[138][153] In 2016, Manchester United eventually took the record away from Real Madrid, signing French midfielder Paul Pogba for ?105 million (S89 million), [154] four years after having released him to Juventus for training compensation.\\r\\nA year after the Pogba transfer, however, there was a major jump in the record fee. Paris St. Germain matched the ?222 million buyout fee of Barcelona's Neymar, converted to a reported S198 million[4][5] or S200 million[2][7] by different sources.

Criminal justice is also a field of study. Those accused of crime have some protections against abuse of investigatory and prosecution powers.\\r\\nIn the United States, criminal justice policy has been guided by the 1967 President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, which issued a ground-breaking report \\"The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society\\". This report made more than 200 recommendations as part of a comprehensive approach toward the prevention and fighting of crime. Some of those recommendations found their way into the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The Commission advocated a \\"systems\\" approach to criminal justice, with improved coordination among law enforcement, courts, and correctional agencies.[1] The President's Commission defined the criminal justice system as the means for society to \\"enforce the standards of conduct necessary to protect individuals and the community.\\"[2]\\r\\nThe criminal justice system in England and Wales aims to \\"reduce crime by bringing more offences to justice, and to raise public confidence that the system is fair and will deliver for the law-abiding citizen.\\"[3] In Canada, the criminal justice system aims to balance the goals of crime control and prevention, and justice (equity, fairness, protection of individual rights).[4] In Sweden, the overarching goal for the criminal justice system is to reduce crime and increase the security of the people.[3] In China, the justice system aims to keep the society functioning well and to protect every person's rights.[citation needed] Overall, criminal justice plays a huge role throughout society as a whole in all of its locations.\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Law From Old English lagu (something laid down or fixed) (Harper, Douglas. \\"law\\". Online Etymology Dictionary.?); legal comes from Latin legalis, from lex \\"law,\\" \\"statute\\" (Harper, Douglas. \\"legal\\". Online Etymology Dictionary.?) is a system of rules usually enforced through a set of institutions. The purpose of law is to provide an objective set of rules for governing conduct and maintaining order in a society.\\r\\nThe oldest known codified law is the Code of Hammurabi, dating back to about 1754 BC. The preface directly credits the laws to the code of hammurabi of Ur. In different parts of the world, law could be established by philosophers or religion. In the modern world, laws are typically created and enforced by governments. These codified laws may coexist with or contradict other forms of social control, such as religious proscriptions, professional rules and ethics, or the cultural mores and customs of a society.\\r\\nWithin the realm of codified law, there are generally two forms of law that the courts are concerned with. Civil laws are rules and regulations which govern transactions and grievances between individual citizens. Criminal law is concerned with actions which are dangerous or harmful to society as a whole, in which prosecution is pursued not by an individual but rather by the state. The purpose of criminal law is to provide the specific definition of what constitutes a crime and to prescribe punishments for committing such a crime. No criminal law can be valid unless it includes both of these factors. The subject of criminal justice is, of course, primarily concerned with the enforcement of criminal law.\\r\\nThe criminal justice system consists of three main parts: (1) Law Enforcement (police officers, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, etc...)?; (2) Courts (attorneys, judges, etc...)?; and (3) corrections (jails, prisons, probation and parole). In the criminal justice system, these distinct agencies operate together both under the rule of law and as the principal means of maintaining the rule of law within society.[5]\\r\\nFor the purposes of section 8(6) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 and section 194A(6) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, the criminal justice system includes, in particular, the investigation of offences and the treatment of offenders.[6]\\r\\nThe first contact a defendant has with the criminal justice system is usually with the police (or law enforcement) who investigate the suspected wrongdoing and make an arrest, but if the suspect is dangerous to the whole nation, a national level law enforcement agency is called in. When warranted, law enforcement agencies or police officers are empowered to use force and other forms of legal coercion and means to effect public and social order. The term is most commonly associated with police departments of a state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. The word comes from the Latin politia (\\"civil administration\\"), which itself derives from the Ancient Greek ??, for polis (\\"city\\").[7] The first police force comparable to the present-day police was established in 1667 under King Louis XIV in France, although modern police usually trace their origins to the 1800 establishment of the Marine Police in London, the Glasgow Police, and the Napoleonic police of Paris.[8][9][10]\\r\\nPolice are primarily concerned with keeping the peace and enforcing criminal law based on their particular mission and jurisdiction. Formed in 1908, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began as an entity which could investigate and enforce specific federal laws as an investigative and \\"law enforcement agency\\" in the United States;[11] this, however, has constituted only a small portion of overall policing activity.[12] Policing has included an array of activities in different contexts, but the predominant ones are concerned with order maintenance and the provision of services.[13] During modern times, such endeavors contribute toward fulfilling a shared mission among law enforcement organizations with respect to the traditional policing mission of deterring crime and maintaining societal order.[14]\\r\\nThe courts serve as the venue where disputes are then settled and justice is administered. With regard to criminal justice, there are a number of critical people in any court setting. These critical people are referred to as the courtroom work group and include both professional and non professional individuals. These include the judge, prosecutor, and the defense attorney. The judge, or magistrate, is a person, elected or appointed, who is knowledgeable in the law, and whose function is to objectively administer the legal proceedings and offer a final decision to dispose of a case.\\r\\nIn the U.S. and in a growing number of nations, guilt or innocence (although in the U.S. a jury can never find a defendant \\"innocent\\" but rather \\"not guilty\\") is decided through the adversarial system. In this system, two parties will both offer their version of events and argue their case before the court (sometimes before a judge or panel of judges, sometimes before a jury). The case should be decided in favor of the party who offers the most sound and compelling arguments based on the law as applied to the facts of the case.\\r\\nThe prosecutor, or district attorney, is a lawyer who brings charges against a person, persons or corporate entity. It is the prosecutor's duty to explain to the court what crime was committed and to detail what evidence has been found which incriminates the accused. The prosecutor should not be confused with a plaintiff or plaintiff's counsel. Although both serve the function of bringing a complaint before the court, the prosecutor is a servant of the state who makes accusations on behalf of the state in criminal proceedings, while the plaintiff is the complaining party in civil proceedings.\\r\\nA defense attorney counsels the accused on the legal process, likely outcomes for the accused and suggests strategies. The accused, not the lawyer, has the right to make final decisions regarding a number of fundamental points, including whether to testify, and to accept a plea offer or demand a jury trial in appropriate cases. It is the defense attorney's duty to represent the interests of the client, raise procedural and evidentiary issues, and hold the prosecution to its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Defense counsel may challenge evidence presented by the prosecution or present exculpatory evidence and argue on behalf of their client. At trial, the defense attorney may attempt to offer a rebuttal to the prosecutor's accusations.\\r\\nIn the U.S., an accused person is entitled to a government-paid defense attorney if he or she is in jeopardy of losing his or her life and/or liberty. Those who cannot afford a private attorney may be provided one by the state. Historically, however, the right to a defense attorney has not always been universal. For example, in Tudor England criminals accused of treason were not permitted to offer arguments in their defense. In many jurisdictions, there is no right to an appointed attorney, if the accused is not in jeopardy of losing his or her liberty.\\r\\nThe final determination of guilt or innocence is typically made by a third party, who is supposed to be disinterested. This function may be performed by a judge, a panel of judges, or a jury panel composed of unbiased citizens. This process varies depending on the laws of the specific jurisdiction. In some places the panel (be it judges or a jury) is required to issue a unanimous decision, while in others only a majority vote is required. In America, this process depends on the state, level of court, and even agreements between the prosecuting and defending parties. Some nations do not use juries at all, or rely on theological or military authorities to issue verdicts.\\r\\nSome cases can be disposed of without the need for a trial. In fact, the vast majority are. If the accused confesses his or her guilt, a shorter process may be employed and a judgment may be rendered more quickly. Some nations, such as America, allow plea bargaining in which the accused pleads guilty, nolo contendere or not guilty, and may accept a diversion program or reduced punishment, where the prosecution's case is weak or in exchange for the cooperation of the accused against other people. This reduced sentence is sometimes a reward for sparing the state the expense of a formal trial. Many nations do not permit the use of plea bargaining, believing that it coerces innocent people to plead guilty in an attempt to avoid a harsh punishment.\\r\\nThe entire trial process, whatever the country, is fraught with problems and subject to criticism. Bias and discrimination form an ever-present threat to an objective decision. Any prejudice on the part of the lawyers, the judge, or jury members threatens to destroy the court's credibility. Some people argue that the often Byzantine rules governing courtroom conduct and processes restrict a layman's ability to participate, essentially reducing the legal process to a battle between the lawyers. In this case, the criticism is that the decision is based less on sound justice and more on the lawyer's eloquence and charisma. This is a particular problem when the lawyer performs in a substandard manner. The jury process is another area of frequent criticism, as there are few mechanisms to guard against poor judgment or incompetence on the part of the layman jurors. Judges themselves are very subject to bias subject to things as ordinary as the length of time since their last break.[15]\\r\\nManipulations of the court system by defense and prosecution attorneys, law enforcement as well as the defendants have occurred and there have been cases where justice was denied.[16] [17]\\r\\nOffenders are then turned over to the correctional authorities, from the court system after the accused has been found guilty. Like all other aspects of criminal justice, the administration of punishment has taken many different forms throughout history. Early on, when civilizations lacked the resources necessary to construct and maintain prisons, exile and execution were the primary forms of punishment. Historically shame punishments and exile have also been used as forms of censure.\\r\\nThe most publicly visible form of punishment in the modern era is the prison. Prisons may serve as detention centers for prisoners after trial. For containment of the accused, jails are used. Early prisons were used primarily to sequester criminals and little thought was given to living conditions within their walls. In America, the Quaker movement is commonly credited with establishing the idea that prisons should be used to reform criminals. This can also be seen as a critical moment in the debate regarding the purpose of punishment.\\r\\nPunishment (in the form of prison time) may serve a variety of purposes. First, and most obviously, the incarceration of criminals removes them from the general population and inhibits their ability to perpetrate further crimes. A new goal of prison punishments is to offer criminals a chance to be rehabilitated. Many modern prisons offer schooling or job training to prisoners as a chance to learn a vocation and thereby earn a legitimate living when they are returned to society. Religious institutions also have a presence in many prisons, with the goal of teaching ethics and instilling a sense of morality in the prisoners. If a prisoner is released before his time is served, he is released as a parole. This means that they are released, but the restrictions are greater than that of someone on probation.\\r\\nThere are numerous other forms of punishment which are commonly used in conjunction with or in place of prison terms. Monetary fines are one of the oldest forms of punishment still used today. These fines may be paid to the state or to the victims as a form of reparation. Probation and house arrest are also sanctions which seek to limit a person's mobility and his or her opportunities to commit crimes without actually placing them in a prison setting. Furthermore, many jurisdictions may require some form of public or community service as a form of reparations for lesser offenses. In Corrections, the Department ensures court-ordered, pre-sentence chemical dependency assessments, related Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative specific examinations and treatment will occur for offenders sentenced to Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative in compliance with RCW 9.94A.660.\\r\\nExecution or capital punishment is still used around the world. Its use is one of the most heavily debated aspects of the criminal justice system. Some societies are willing to use executions as a form of political control, or for relatively minor misdeeds.

It emerged as an academic discipline in the 1920s, beginning with Berkeley police chief August Vollmer who established a criminal justice program at the University of California, Berkeley in 1916.[18] Vollmer's work was carried on by his student, O.W. Wilson, who led efforts to professionalize policing and reduce corruption. Other programs were established in the United States at Indiana University, Michigan State University, San Jose State University, and the University of Washington.[19] As of 1950, criminal justice students were estimated to number less than 1,000.[citation needed] Until the 1960s, the primary focus of criminal justice in the United States was on policing and police science.\\r\\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, crime rates soared and social issues took center stage in the public eye. A number of new laws and studies focused federal resources on researching new approaches to crime control. The Warren Court (the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren), issued a series of rulings which redefined citizen's rights and substantially altered the powers and responsibilities of police and the courts. The Civil Rights Era offered significant legal and ethical challenges to the status quo.\\r\\nIn the late 1960s, with the establishment of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) and associated policy changes that resulted with the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The LEAA provided grants for criminology research, focusing on social aspects of crime. By the 1970s, there were 729 academic programs in criminology and criminal justice in the United States.[19] Largely thanks to the Law Enforcement Education Program, criminal justice students numbered over 100,000 by 1975. Over time, scholars of criminal justice began to include criminology, sociology, and psychology, among others, to provide a more comprehensive view of the criminal justice system and the root causes of crime. Criminal justice studies now combine the practical and technical policing skills with a study of social deviance as a whole.\\r\\nCriminal justice degree programs at four-year institutions typically include coursework in statistics, methods of research, criminal justice, policing, U.S court systems, criminal courts, corrections, community corrections, criminal procedure, criminal law, victimology, juvenile justice, and a variety of special topics. A number of universities offer a Bachelor of Criminal Justice.\\r\\nThe modern criminal justice system has evolved since ancient times, with new forms of punishment, added rights for offenders and victims, and policing reforms. These developments have reflected changing customs, political ideals, and economic conditions. In ancient times through the Middle Ages, exile was a common form of punishment. During the Middle Ages, payment to the victim (or the victim's family), known as wergild, was another common punishment, including for violent crimes. For those who could not afford to buy their way out of punishment, harsh penalties included various forms of corporal punishment. These included mutilation, branding, and flogging, as well as execution.\\r\\nThough a prison, Le Stinche, existed as early as the 14th century in Florence, Italy,[20] incarceration was not widely used until the 19th century. Correctional reform in the United States was first initiated by William Penn, towards the end of the 17th century. For a time, Pennsylvania's criminal code was revised to forbid torture and other forms of cruel punishment, with jails and prisons replacing corporal punishment. These reforms were reverted, upon Penn's death in 1718. Under pressure from a group of Quakers, these reforms were revived in Pennsylvania toward the end of the 18th century, and led to a marked drop in Pennsylvania's crime rate. Patrick Colquhoun, Henry Fielding and others led significant reforms during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.[21]\\r\\nThe first modern police force is commonly said to be the Metropolitan Police in London, established in 1829 by Sir Robert Peel.[22][23] Based on the Peelian principles, it promoted the preventive role of police as a deterrent to urban crime and disorder.[24][25] In the United States, police departments were first established in Boston in 1838, and New York City in 1844. Early on, police were not respected by the community, as corruption was rampant.\\r\\nIn the 1920s, led by Berkeley, California police chief, August Vollmer and O.W. Wilson, police began to professionalize, adopt new technologies, and place emphasis on training and professional qualifications of new hires. Despite such reforms, police agencies were led by highly autocratic leaders, and there remained a lack of respect between police and the community. Following urban unrest in the 1960s, police placed more emphasis on community relations, enacted reforms such as increased diversity in hiring, and many police agencies adopted community policing strategies.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, CompStat was developed by the New York Police Department as an information-based system for tracking and mapping crime patterns and trends, and holding police accountable for dealing with crime problems. CompStat has since been replicated in police departments across the United States and around the world, with problem-oriented policing, intelligence-led policing, and other information-led policing strategies also adopted.","input":"What are the goals of the american criminal justice system?"},{"output":"Sixteen","context":"Under the present Constitution of the Philippines, the President of the Philippines (Filipino: Pangulo ng Pilipinas) is both the head of state and the head of government, and serves as the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces.[4] The President is directly elected by qualified voters of the population to a six-year term and must be \\"a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least forty years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election\\".

Seismologists today estimate the Lisbon earthquake had a magnitude in the range 8.5ÿ9.0[3][4] on the moment magnitude scale, with its epicentre in the Atlantic Ocean about 200?km (120?mi) west-southwest of Cape St. Vincent. Estimates place the death toll in Lisbon alone between 10,000 and 100,000 people,[5] making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history.\\r\\nThe earthquake accentuated political tensions in the Kingdom of Portugal and profoundly disrupted the country's colonial ambitions. The event was widely discussed and dwelt upon by European Enlightenment philosophers, and inspired major developments in theodicy. As the first earthquake studied scientifically for its effects over a large area, it led to the birth of modern seismology and earthquake engineering.\\r\\nIn Chapter 6 of Candide it is mentioned that \\"there was another earthquake, causing frightful damage.\\" In his 1966 edition of Voltaire's work Robert Adams states that this second quake occurred on 21 December 1755.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earthquake struck on the morning of 1 November 1755, the holy day of All Saints' Day. Contemporary reports state that the earthquake lasted between three and a half and six minutes, causing fissures 5 metres (16 feet) wide to open in the city centre. Survivors rushed to the open space of the docks for safety and watched as the water receded, revealing a sea floor littered with lost cargo and shipwrecks. Approximately 40 minutes after the earthquake, a tsunami engulfed the harbour and downtown area, rushing up the Tagus river[6] \\"so fast that several people riding on horseback?... were forced to gallop as fast as possible to the upper grounds for fear of being carried away.\\" It was followed by two more waves. Candles had been lit all around the city, in homes and churches alike, for All Saints' Day, and had then been knocked dangerously over in the earthquake's commotion. As the tsunami waters receded, the city began to burn so drastically a true firestorm burned for hours in the city, asphysxiating people up to a hundred feet from the blaze. [7]\\r\\nLisbon was not the only Portuguese city affected by the catastrophe. Throughout the south of the country, in particular the Algarve, destruction was rampant. The tsunami destroyed some coastal fortresses in the Algarve and, in the lower levels, it razed several houses. Almost all the coastal towns and villages of the Algarve were heavily damaged, except Faro, which was protected by the sandy banks of Ria Formosa. In Lagos, the waves reached the top of the city walls. Other towns of different Portuguese regions, such as Peniche, Cascais, and even Covilh?, which is located near the Serra da Estrela mountain range in central inland Portugal, were affected. The shock waves of the earthquake destroyed part of Covilh?'s castle walls and its large towers. On the island of Madeira, Funchal and many smaller settlements suffered significant damage. Almost all of the ports in the Azores archipelago suffered most of their destruction from the tsunami, with the sea penetrating about 150 m inland.\\r\\nShocks from the earthquake were felt throughout Europe[8][9] as far as Finland and North Africa, and according to some sources even in Greenland,[10] and the Caribbean.[11] Tsunamis as tall as 20?metres (66?ft) swept the coast of North Africa, and struck Martinique and Barbados across the Atlantic. A three-metre (ten-foot) tsunami hit Cornwall on the southern English coast. Galway, on the west coast of Ireland, was also hit, resulting in partial destruction of the \\"Spanish Arch\\" section of the city wall. At Kinsale, several vessels were whirled round in the harbor, and water poured into the marketplace.[11]\\r\\nIn 2015, it was revealed that the tsunami waves may have reached the coast of Brazil, then a colony of Portugal. Such a hypothesis was raised by reviewing letters sent by Brazilian authorities at the time of the earthquake. These letters describe damage and destruction caused by gigantic waves.[12]\\r\\nAlthough seismologists and geologists have always agreed that the epicentre was in the Atlantic to the West of the Iberian Peninsula, its exact location has been a subject of considerable debate. Early hypotheses had proposed the Gorringe Ridge until simulations showed that a source closer to the shore of Portugal was required to comply with the observed effects of the tsunami. A seismic reflection survey of the ocean floor along the AzoresÿGibraltar Transform Fault has revealed a 50?km-long thrust structure southwest of Cape St. Vincent, with a dip-slip throw of more than 1?km. This structure may have created the primary tectonic event.[13]\\r\\nEconomic historian lvaro Pereira estimated that of Lisbon's population at the time, of approximately 200,000 people, some 30,000ÿ40,000 were killed; another 10,000 may have lost their lives in Morocco. However, a 2009 study of contemporary reports relating to the 1 November event found them vague and difficult to separate from reports of another local series of earthquakes on 18ÿ19 November.[14] Pereira estimated the total death toll in Portugal, Spain and Morocco from the earthquake and the resulting fires and tsunami at 40,000 to 50,000 people.[15][16]\\r\\nEighty-five percent of Lisbon's buildings were destroyed, including famous palaces and libraries, as well as most examples of Portugal's distinctive 16th-century Manueline architecture. Several buildings that had suffered little earthquake damage were destroyed by the subsequent fire. The new Lisbon opera house (the \\"܇pera do Tejo\\"), opened just six months before, burned to the ground. The Royal Ribeira Palace, which stood just beside the Tagus river in the modern square of Terreiro do Pa?o, was destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami. Inside, the 70,000-volume royal library as well as hundreds of works of art, including paintings by Titian, Rubens, and Correggio, were lost. The royal archives disappeared together with detailed historical records of explorations by Vasco da Gama and other early navigators. The palace of Henrique de Meneses, 3rd Marquis of Louri?al, which housed an invaluable library of 18,000 books, was also destroyed.[17] The earthquake damaged several major churches in Lisbon, namely the Lisbon Cathedral, the Basilicas of S?o Paulo, Santa Catarina, S?o Vicente de Fora, and the Miseric܇rdia Church. The Royal Hospital of All Saints (the largest public hospital at the time) in the Rossio square was consumed by fire and hundreds of patients burned to death. The tomb of national hero Nuno lvares Pereira was also lost. Visitors to Lisbon may still walk the ruins of the Carmo Convent, which were preserved to remind Lisboners of the destruction.\\r\\nThe royal family escaped unharmed from the catastrophe: King Joseph I of Portugal and the court had left the city, after attending mass at sunrise, fulfilling the wish of one of the king's daughters to spend the holiday away from Lisbon. After the catastrophe, Joseph I developed a fear of living within walls, and the court was accommodated in a huge complex of tents and pavilions in the hills of Ajuda, then on the outskirts of Lisbon. The king's claustrophobia never waned, and it was only after Joseph's death that his daughter Maria I of Portugal began building the royal Ajuda Palace, which still stands on the site of the old tented camp. Like the king, the prime minister Sebasti?o de Melo (1st Marquis of Pombal) survived the earthquake. When asked what was to be done, Pombal reportedly replied \\"Bury the dead and heal the living\\",[18] and set about organizing relief and rehabilitation efforts. Firefighters were sent to extinguish the raging flames, and teams of workers and ordinary citizens were ordered to remove the thousands of corpses before disease could spread. Contrary to custom and against the wishes of the Church, many corpses were loaded onto barges and buried at sea beyond the mouth of the Tagus. To prevent disorder in the ruined city, the Portuguese Army was deployed and gallows were constructed at high points around the city to deter looters; more than thirty people were publicly executed.[19] The army prevented many able-bodied citizens from fleeing, pressing them into relief and reconstruction work.\\r\\nThe king and the prime minister immediately launched efforts to rebuild the city. On 4 December 1755, little more than a month after the earthquake, Manuel da Maia, chief engineer to the realm, presented his plans for the re-building of Lisbon. Maia presented four options from abandoning Lisbon to building a completely new city. The first plan was to rebuild the old city using re-cycled materials; this was the cheapest option. The second and third plans proposed widening certain streets. The fourth option boldly proposed razing the entire Baixa quarter and \\"laying out new streets without restraint\\". This last option was chosen by the king and his minister.[20]\\r\\nIn less than a year, the city was cleared of debris. Keen to have a new and perfectly ordered city, the king commissioned the construction of big squares, rectilinear, large avenues and widened streets?ÿ the new mottos of Lisbon.\\r\\nThe Pombaline buildings are among the earliest seismically protected constructions in Europe. Small wooden models were built for testing, and earthquakes were simulated by marching troops around them. Lisbon's \\"new\\" Lower Town, known today as the Pombaline Lower Town (Baixa Pombalina), is one of the city's famed attractions. Sections of other Portuguese cities, such as the Vila Real de Santo Ant܇nio in Algarve, were also rebuilt along Pombaline principles.\\r\\nThe Casa Pia, a Portuguese institution founded by Maria I (known as A Pia, \\"Maria the Pious\\"), and organized by Police Intendant Pina Manique in 1780, was founded following the social disarray of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\\r\\nThe earthquake had wide-ranging effects on the lives of the populace and intelligentsia. The earthquake had struck on an important religious holiday and had destroyed almost every important church in the city, causing anxiety and confusion amongst the citizens of a staunch and devout Roman Catholic country. Theologians and philosophers focused and speculated on the religious cause and message, seeing the earthquake as a manifestation of divine judgment.[21]\\r\\nA 2009 study estimated that the earthquake cost between 32 and 48 percent of Portugal's GDP.[22] Also, \\"in spite of strict controls, prices and wages remained volatile in the years after the tragedy. The recovery from the earthquake also led to a rise in the wage premium of construction workers. More significantly, the earthquake became an opportunity to reform the economy and to reduce the economic semi-dependency vis--vis Britain.\\"[22]\\r\\nThe earthquake and its fallout strongly influenced the intelligentsia of the European Age of Enlightenment. The noted writer-philosopher Voltaire used the earthquake in Candide and in his Pome sur le dsastre de Lisbonne (\\"Poem on the Lisbon disaster\\"). Voltaire's Candide attacks the notion that all is for the best in this, \\"the best of all possible worlds\\", a world closely supervised by a benevolent deity. The Lisbon disaster provided a counterexample. As Theodor Adorno wrote, \\"[t]he earthquake of Lisbon sufficed to cure Voltaire of the theodicy of Leibniz\\" (Negative Dialectics 361). In the later twentieth century, following Adorno, the 1755 earthquake has sometimes been compared to the Holocaust as a catastrophe that transformed European culture and philosophy. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was also influenced by the devastation following the earthquake, whose severity he believed was due to too many people living within the close quarters of the city. Rousseau used the earthquake as an argument against cities as part of his desire for a more naturalistic way of life.[23]\\r\\nImmanuel Kant published three separate texts on the Lisbon earthquake. As a younger man, fascinated with the earthquake, he collected all the information available to him in news pamphlets, and used it to formulate a theory of the causes of earthquakes. Kant's theory, which involved the shifting of huge subterranean caverns filled with hot gases, was (though ultimately shown to be incorrect) one of the first systematic modern attempts to explain earthquakes by positing natural, rather than supernatural, causes. According to Walter Benjamin, Kant's slim early book on the earthquake \\"probably represents the beginnings of scientific geography in Germany. And certainly the beginnings of seismology.\\"\\r\\nWerner Hamacher has claimed that the earthquake's consequences extended into the vocabulary of philosophy, making the common metaphor of firm \\"grounding\\" for philosophers' arguments shaky and uncertain: \\"Under the impression exerted by the Lisbon earthquake, which touched the European mind in one [of] its more sensitive epochs, the metaphor of ground and tremor completely lost their apparent innocence; they were no longer merely figures of speech\\" (263). Hamacher claims that the foundational certainty of Descartes' philosophy began to shake following the Lisbon earthquake.\\r\\nThe earthquake had a major impact on Portuguese politics. The prime minister was the favorite of the king, but the aristocracy despised him as an upstart son of a country squire (although Prime Minister Sebasti?o de Melo is known today as Marquis of Pombal, the title was only granted in 1770, fifteen years after the earthquake). The prime minister in turn disliked the old nobles, whom he considered corrupt and incapable of practical action. Before 1 November 1755 there was a constant struggle for power and royal favor, but the competent response of the Marquis of Pombal effectively severed the power of the old aristocratic factions. However, silent opposition and resentment of King Joseph I began to rise, which would culminate with the attempted assassination of the king and the subsequent elimination of the powerful Duke of Aveiro and the Tvora family.[clarification needed]\\r\\nThe prime minister's response was not limited to the practicalities of reconstruction. He ordered a query sent to all parishes of the country regarding the earthquake and its effects. Questions included:\\r\\nThe answers to these and other questions are still archived in the Torre do Tombo, the national historical archive. Studying and cross-referencing the priests' accounts, modern scientists were able to reconstruct the event from a scientific perspective. Without the questionnaire designed by the Marquis of Pombal, this would have been impossible. Because the marquis was the first to attempt an objective scientific description of the broad causes and consequences of an earthquake, he is regarded as a forerunner of modern seismological scientists.\\r\\nThe geological causes of this earthquake and the seismic activity in the region continue to be discussed and debated by contemporary scientists.","input":"What was the magnitude of the lisbon earthquake?"},{"output":"prosecuted under federal criminal law and not under state criminal law","context":"In the United States, a federal crime or federal offense is an act that is made illegal by U.S. federal legislation.

Prior to 1932 it was a fully circulating coin within Britain's then Gold Standard currency. Today it is used as a bullion coin and is sometimes mounted in jewellery. The most valuable sovereign is the British Edward VIII 1937 struck for Edward VIII who abdicated, therefore these coins never entered circulation, and an example of one was purchased at auction in 2014 for S516,000.[1]\\r\\nNamed after the English gold sovereign, last minted in 1604, the name was revived with the Great Recoinage of 1816.[2] Minting these new sovereigns began in 1817. By the coin act of 1816, 12 Troy ounces of 22-carat gold were worth 44.5 Guineas (a Guinea being S1.05). This meant that the 1-pound sovereign should weigh 160/623 ounces (~0.257?oz or 7.98?g), whereas its content of pure gold was 22/24 of this (~0.23542?oz or ca. 7.322381?g). This weight has remained almost constant  rounding at 10?6?g took place on its legal redefinition in the decimalised rather than fractional system of coin weights.[3]\\r\\nSovereigns have been minted in the United Kingdom from 1817 to 1917, in 1925, and from 1957 to the present. In the past Australia, Canada, and South Africa all occasionally minted the coins. Today, they are minted at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Wales, and under licence by MMTC-PAMP near Delhi, India.[4]\\r\\nIn addition to the sovereign, the Royal Mint also struck ten-shilling half sovereigns, two-pound double sovereigns, and five-pound quintuple sovereign coins. Only the sovereign and the half sovereign were commonly struck for circulation. The coins bear no notation of value, and denomination must be attributed by size or weight.\\r\\nIn 2009, The Royal Mint released a new coin in the sovereign series: the quarter-sovereign, similar in some ways to the original gold English crown of the rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSovereigns minted since 1817 have been produced according to the act of 1816 (56 George III chapter 68):\\r\\nThe initial reverse type for gold coins was the shield and crown motif, supplemented on the sovereign with a heraldic wreath. This was succeeded by a portrayal of Saint George killing a dragon, engraved by Benedetto Pistrucci.[6] This same design is still in use on British gold sovereigns, although other reverse designs have also been used during the reigns of King William IV, Queen Victoria, King George IV, and Queen Elizabeth II.\\r\\nIn Victorian times it was the practice of the Bank of England to remove worn sovereigns and half sovereigns from circulation and to have them recoined. Consequently, although a billion sovereigns have been minted in total, that figure includes gold that has been coined and recoined a number of times. In addition, when coins were sent to places such as the United States for international payments between governments, they were frequently melted down into gold bars because of the Federal regulations then in force. When gold coins were finally withdrawn from circulation in 1933 in the US, many thousands of British gold sovereigns were consigned to the melting pot in this way.\\r\\nIt is estimated that in circulation a sovereign could have a lifespan of up to 15 years before it fell below the \\"least current weight\\", that is, the minimum amount of gold below which it ceased to be legal tender. English law allows a sovereign to be legal tender so long as it weighs 7.93787?g (0.280000?oz), or more;[3] and the difference between this and the full standard weight of 7.98805?g (0.281770?oz) (approx. 0.6%) represents the margin allowed for abrasion. It was actually the half-sovereign that had the most circulation in Victorian Britain. Many sovereigns languished in bank vaults for most of their lives. In 1889 and 1890 Orders in Council were made permitting members of the general public to hand in any gold coins that were underweight and have them replaced by full-weight coins. A proclamation was subsequently issued in November 1890 that any gold coin struck before 1837 would cease to be legal tender with effect from 28 February 1891.[7] This recycled gold was subsequently reminted into 13,680,486 half sovereigns in 1892 and 10,846,741 sovereigns in 1900. (Both figures are for the London branch of the Royal Mint.)\\r\\nSovereign obverse (heads) dies were also used in the nineteenth century to create farthings once they had become worn. (An obverse die could typically produce 100,000 coins.)\\r\\nSovereigns were produced in large quantities until World War I, at which time the UK came off the gold standard. From then until 1932, sovereigns were produced only at branch mints at Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Bombay, Ottawa, and Pretoria (except for some in 1925 produced in London as part of Winston Churchill's ill-fated attempt to return the UK to the gold standard). The last regular issue was in 1932 (at Pretoria).\\r\\nIn 1949, 1950 and 1951 the Royal Mint produced sovereigns, but instead of preparing new dies with George VI's head and with the correct date, they re-issued George V sovereigns dated 1925. A total of 886,000 \\"backdated\\" coins (restrikes) were minted.[8]\\r\\nProduction resumed in 1957, ostensibly to prevent the coin being counterfeited in Syria and Italy.[9] Subsequent publication of treasury papers appear to indicate that sovereigns were widely used in pursuance of British foreign policy in the Middle East, and it was felt that the coin could not be allowed to fall into disrepute, as many individuals were receiving payments in the form of sovereigns for services rendered to the British government.\\r\\nSovereigns were produced most years as bullion until 1982. From there to 1999, proof coinage only versions were produced, but since 2000, bullion sovereigns have been minted. Modern sovereigns are minted at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Wales. The coins are produced in the precious metal unit which is sealed off from the rest of the Mint, the Mint itself being protected by Ministry of Defence Police.\\r\\nMintage figures for the latest British coin production are given below. Please note: these are the actual numbers of coins issued, not the official issue limits often advertised. In addition, the Mint will strike extra coins for the purposes of quality control, i.e. samples of coins are submitted for the Trial of the Pyx which involves their destruction. Thus, an issue limit figure never fully reveals the true number actually created. Furthermore, the date on a bullion coin refers to the year the die was made, not necessarily the year in which it was struck. It is not unknown for the Mint to strike gold sovereigns with the date of the previous (or even older) years, e.g. bullion sovereigns struck during the reign of George VI were all dated 1925 and featured the head of George V. Additionally, the Royal Mint was selling sovereigns dated 2010 in December 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gold sovereign appears quite a small coin, but with a face value of S1 it had, in 1895, the same purchasing power as S103 in 2014.[10] Gold is a dense metal: the sovereign contains 0.23542 ounces of gold, with a total weight of 0.25682 ounces. A reason to limit production of double sovereigns (S2) and quintuple sovereigns (S5) was the relative ease of removing gold from these larger coins  chemically, by filing, or using other techniques; for example, drilling small holes into the coin followed by hammering to conceal the holes, or \\"sweating\\": shaking a leather bag full of coins for a long period and collecting the gold dust that was knocked off.[11]\\r\\nCounterfeit coins can be detected either visually by comparison with known genuine coins, by using a coin gauge,[12] or by precise weighing and measurement against standard dimensions (see Specifications above).\\r\\nThis picture shows a sovereign balance or sovereign rocker, which was used to check that the weight was adequate, that the thickness and diameter were not excessive, and that the shape was a good circular cylinder.\\r\\nThere are many recorded[clarification needed] fake or counterfeit gold sovereigns in circulation,[13] although they are still relatively scarce in comparison to the numbers of genuine coins, due to the difficulty of accurately replicating such a small coin economically. With numismatic fakes, the counterfeiter might use the correct proportions of gold, but try to replicate an older coin with special rarity value. Such fakes present a potential problem only to the numismatic collector, as they still have standard bullion content.\\r\\nOccasionally one comes across fake sovereign coins in which the gold is replaced or alloyed with a substitute metal to look like gold. For example, a few fake sovereigns appeared in circulation which were produced with 9 carat gold instead of the correct 22 carat composition. Such fakes can be relatively easily detected by measurement and weighing using jewellers' scales. Experienced coin dealers will generally detect such fakes immediately, as they are obviously underweight or have the wrong size or thickness, as well as often having minor differences or lack of sharpness in the design details. It is more common to come across counterfeit copies of larger gold coins such as the Krugerrand, which are easier and more economical to copy.\\r\\nGold is, however, a difficult material to counterfeit without detection due to its unique density and colour. Gold is one of the densest metals and therefore much heavier (for equivalent size or volume) than the common metals such as lead, brass, copper and steel that are used to make fake bullion coins. Fake gold coins are either oversize or underweight, or both. A fake made from lead to exactly the same thickness and diameter as a genuine sovereign would be 35% lighter than the genuine coin. If made the correct weight and diameter, it would be 54% too thick.\\r\\nThe sovereign is a \\"protected coin\\" for the purposes of Part II of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.[14]\\r\\nCurrent sovereigns are struck in the same 22 carat (91?%) Crown gold (11/12 gold and 1/12 copper) alloy as the first modern sovereigns of 1817.[15] Alloys are used to make gold coins harder and more durable, so they can resist scratches and dents during handling.\\r\\nThe only time there has been a deviation from this composition was in the production of early Australian sovereigns, which used silver as part of the alloy, and in London sovereigns dated 1887, when an additional 1.25% silver was added in order to make the blanks softer for the new Joseph Boehm relief of Queen Victoria: 1887 London Mint sovereigns are more yellow than other London-produced sovereigns. This additional silver affected the amount of copper in the coin, not, of course, its gold content. (Nineteenth-century techniques of refining were not as advanced as today, and nineteenth-century sovereigns became more accurate in terms of their gold weight as silver ÿ which is often naturally combined with gold ÿ was removed as an impurity from the \\"pure\\" gold used. Such minor inconsistencies would not affect either their numismatic or bullion value).\\r\\nSovereigns usually have a higher premium to the price of gold than some other bullion coins, such as the Krugerrand. This is due to a number of factors: the higher unit cost of the Sovereign (at under one-quarter of an ounce); the higher demand for the Sovereign from numismatists (compared to the Krugerrand which is not sought-after numismatically); and the higher costs of identifying and stocking a numismatic coin.\\r\\nSovereigns have been produced as follows:\\r\\nDuring the 1850s, the colony of Victoria alone contributed more than one-third of the worlds gold output. Although a Mint opened in Sydney in 1855, it had difficulty keeping pace with the output of the goldfields and in 1871 a new branch of the Royal Mint opened in Melbourne. Melbourne sovereigns carry a small M to identify them.\\r\\nMillions of pounds of gold bullion were shipped from Australia to London each year to be minted into coin. However, it soon became apparent that it would be easier to refine the gold and turn it into coins at source, rather than transport it to Britain and have it turned into coins there. Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide each submitted to be the venue of a branch of the Royal Mint and after some deliberation the British government awarded it to Sydney, which began issuing coins in 1855. This mint issued coins with its own design from 1855 until 1870 then, in 1871 the Royal Mint insisted that all gold sovereigns regardless of Mint should carry the British design.\\r\\nThe coins minted by Sydney carry a small S mintmark to identify them for quality control purposes.\\r\\nThe gold mines at Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie in Western Australia, once discovered, quickly became recognised as two of Australias richest. The problems of transporting the raw gold over 2,100 miles to the nearest Mint in Melbourne were obvious and so a new branch of the Royal Mint was authorised and opened in 1899.\\r\\nSovereigns minted at Perth carry a small P mintmark.\\r\\nAnother branch of the British Mint was established in Bombay in India in 1918, where the demand for sovereigns was particularly high. The Bombay mint only produced coins for one year and all are dated 1918. Nonetheless, the Indian mint struck more sovereigns (approximately 1.3 million) in its single year of operation than the Ottawa branch managed in more a decade.\\r\\nSovereigns from the Bombay mint were distinguished by the letter I for India.\\r\\nThe Klondike Gold Rush of 1897-1898 saw more than 25,000 people seek their fortune in the frozen North of Canada. For some time all of Canadas coinage was struck in England but these new gold strikes made this impractical.\\r\\nIn 1908 a Canadian branch of the British Royal Mint was opened in Ottawa. As well as producing silver and base metal coins for everyday use, the new Canadian mint also turned the recently discovered gold into sovereigns striking intermittently between 1908 and 1919.\\r\\nSovereigns of this mint carry a small C mintmark.\\r\\nThe next branch mint was established in Pretoria (South Africa) in 1923. Like the Australian and Canadian mints, this was set up to turn locally mined gold into coins. Significant quantities of gold were discovered in Johannesburg in 1886, setting off another mass migration as speculators, prospectors, fortune-seekers, and adventurers from all over the world descended upon the region.\\r\\nBy the end of the 1890s the area was responsible for a significant percentage of global gold production. Sovereigns, identical to the British coins except for the inclusion of an SA mintmark, were struck at Pretoria between 1923 and 1932.[16]\\r\\nTo address the high demand for gold coins in the Indian market, which does not allow gold coins to be imported,[17] the minting of gold sovereigns in India has resumed since 2013. Indian/Swiss joint venture company MMTC-PAMP mints under licence in its facility close to Delhi with full quality control from the Royal Mint.[18]\\r\\nAs with the 1918 Bombay minting, these coins are UK legal tender, and are of identical design and specification as UK-minted sovereigns except for the 'I' for India mintmark.","input":"How much does a full gold sovereign weight?"},{"output":"Baron Corbin","context":"WWE is a professional wrestling promotion based out of Stamford, Connecticut.

Its name derives from the use of at least a fraction of gold in form of plating or alloying in its manufacture.\\r\\nSince the eighteenth century, gold medals have been awarded in the arts, for example, by the Royal Danish Academy, usually as a symbol of an award to give an outstanding student some financial freedom. Others offer only the prestige of the award. Many organizations now award gold medals either annually or extraordinarily, including UNESCO and various academic societies.\\r\\nWhile some gold medals are solid gold, others are gold-plated or silver-gilt, like those of the Olympic Games, the Lorentz Medal, the United States Congressional Gold Medal and the Nobel Prize medal. Nobel Prize medals consist of 18 karat green gold plated with 24 karat gold. Before 1980 they were struck in 23 karat gold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the establishment of standard military awards, e.g., the Medal of Honor, it was common practice to have a medal specially created to provide national recognition for a significant military or naval victory or accomplishment. In the United States, Congress would enact a resolution asking the President to reward those responsible. The commanding officer would receive a gold medal and his officers silver medals.[1] Other countries similarly honored their military and naval victors in a similar fashion.\\r\\nMedals have historically been given as prizes in various types of competitive activities, especially athletics.\\r\\nTraditionally, medals are made of the following metals:\\r\\nOccasionally, Platinum medals can be awarded.\\r\\nThese metals designate the first three Ages of Man in Greek mythology: the Golden Age, when men lived among the gods, the Silver Age, where youth lasted a hundred years, and the Bronze Age, the era of heroes.\\r\\nThe custom of awarding the sequence of gold, silver, and bronze medals for the first three highest achievers dates from at least the 18th century, with the National Association of Amateur Athletes in the United States awarding such medals as early as 1884.[2]\\r\\nThis standard was adopted for Olympic competition at the 1904 Summer Olympics. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given, not medals.\\r\\nAt the modern Olympic Games, winners of a sporting discipline receive a gold medal in recognition of their achievement.\\r\\nAt the Ancient Olympic Games only one winner per event was crowned with kotinos, an olive wreath made of wild olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Aristophanes in Plutus makes a remark why victorious athletes are crowned with wreath made of wild olive instead of gold.[3] Herodotus describes a story that explains why there were only a few Greek men at the Battle of Thermopylae since \\"all other men were participating in the Olympic Games\\" and that the prize for the winner was \\"an olive-wreath\\". When Tigranes, an Armenian general learned this, he uttered to his leader: \\"Good heavens! what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour\\".[4] Hence medals were not awarded at the ancient Olympic Games.\\r\\nAt the 1896 Summer Olympics, winners received a silver medal and the second-place finisher received a bronze medal. In 1900, most winners received cups or trophies instead of medals. The next three Olympics (1904, 1908, 1912) awarded the winners solid gold medals, but the medals themselves were smaller. The use of gold rapidly declined with the onset of the First World War and also with the onset of the Second World War.[5] The last series of Olympic medals to be made of solid gold were awarded at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden.\\r\\nOlympic Gold medals are required to be made from at least 92.5% silver, and must contain a minimum of 6 grams of gold.[6] All Olympic medals must be at least 60mm in diameter and 3mm thick.[6] Minting the medals is the responsibility of the Olympic host. From 1928 through 1968 the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli of Greek goddess Nike with Rome's Colloseum in the background and text naming the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of Nike saluting an Olympic champion.\\r\\nFrom the 1972 Summer Olympics through 2000, Cassioli's design (or a slight modification) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheater for what originally were Greek games, a new obverse design was commissioned for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. For the 2008 Beijing Olympics medals had a diameter of 70mm and were 6mm thick, with the front displaying a winged figure of victory and the back showed a Beijing Olympics symbol surrounded by an inset jade circle.\\r\\nWinter Olympics medals have been of more varied design. The silver and bronze medals have always borne the same designs.\\r\\nThe award of a gold medal, often coupled with the award of silver and bronze medals to the next place finishers, has been adopted in other sports competitions and in other competitive fields, such as music and writing, as well as some competitive games. Typically bronze medals are awarded only to third place, but in some contests there is some variety, such as International barbershop music contests where bronze medals are awarded for third, fourth, and fifth place.","input":"How much gold is there in the olympic gold medal?"},{"output":"decennial, that is, held every ten years","context":"The census in the United Kingdom is decennial, that is, held every ten years, although there is provision in the Census Act 1920 for a census to take place at intervals of five years or more.

She spent most of her childhood in France while Scotland was ruled by regents, and in 1558, she married the Dauphin of France, Francis. He ascended the French throne as King Francis II in 1559, and Mary briefly became queen consort of France, until his death in December 1560. Widowed, Mary returned to Scotland, arriving in Leith on 19 August 1561. Four years later, she married her first cousin, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley and in June 1566 they had a son, James.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1567, Darnley's residence was destroyed by an explosion, and he was found murdered in the garden. James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, was generally believed to have orchestrated Darnley's death, but he was acquitted of the charge in April 1567, and the following month he married Mary. Following an uprising against the couple, Mary was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle. On 24 July 1567 she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son. After an unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne, she fled southwards seeking the protection of her first cousin once removed, Queen Elizabeth I of England. Mary had once claimed Elizabeth's throne as her own, and was considered the legitimate sovereign of England by many English Catholics, including participants in a rebellion known as the Rising of the North. Perceiving her as a threat, Elizabeth had her confined in various castles and manor houses in the interior of England. After eighteen and a half years in custody, Mary was found guilty of plotting to assassinate Elizabeth in 1586. She was beheaded the following year at Fotheringhay Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was born on 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland, to King James V and his French second wife, Mary of Guise. She was said to have been born prematurely and was the only legitimate child of James to survive him.[4] She was the great-niece of King Henry VIII of England, as her paternal grandmother, Margaret Tudor, was Henry VIII's sister. On 14?December, six days after her birth, she became Queen of Scotland when her father died, perhaps from the effects of a nervous collapse following the Battle of Solway Moss,[5] or from drinking contaminated water while on campaign.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nA popular legend, first recorded by John Knox, states that James, hearing on his deathbed that his wife had given birth to a daughter, ruefully exclaimed, \\"It cam wi' a lass and it will gang wi' a lass!\\"[7] His House of Stuart had gained the throne of Scotland by the marriage of Marjorie Bruce, daughter of Robert the Bruce, to Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland. The crown had come to his family through a woman, and would be lost from his family through a woman. This legendary statement came true much laternot through Mary, but through her descendant Queen Anne.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was baptised at the nearby Church of St Michael shortly after she was born.[9] Rumours spread that she was weak and frail,[10] but an English diplomat, Ralph Sadler, saw the infant at Linlithgow Palace in March 1543, unwrapped by her nurse, and wrote, \\"it is as goodly a child as I have seen of her age, and as like to live.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Mary was an infant when she inherited the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two claims to the regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim was based on a version of the king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery.[12] Arran, with the support of his friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Henry VIII of England took the opportunity of the regency to propose marriage between Mary and his own son and heir, Edward, hoping for a union of Scotland and England. On 1 July 1543, when Mary was six months old, the Treaty of Greenwich was signed, which promised that at the age of ten Mary would marry Edward and move to England, where Henry could oversee her upbringing.[14] The treaty provided that the two countries would remain legally separate and that if the couple should fail to have children the temporary union would dissolve.[15] However, Cardinal Beaton rose to power again and began to push a pro-Catholic pro-French agenda, which angered Henry, who wanted to break the Scottish alliance with France.[16] Beaton wanted to move Mary away from the coast to the safety of Stirling Castle. Regent Arran resisted the move, but backed down when Beaton's armed supporters gathered at Linlithgow.[17] The Earl of Lennox escorted Mary and her mother to Stirling on 27 July 1543 with 3,500 armed men.[18] Mary was crowned in the castle chapel on 9 September 1543,[19] with \\"such solemnity as they do use in this country, which is not very costly\\" according to the report of Ralph Sadler and Henry Ray.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly before Mary's coronation, Scottish merchants headed for France were arrested by Henry, and their goods impounded. The arrests caused anger in Scotland, and Arran joined Beaton and became a Catholic.[21] The Treaty of Greenwich was rejected by the Parliament of Scotland in December.[22] The rejection of the marriage treaty and the renewal of the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland prompted Henry's \\"Rough Wooing\\", a military campaign designed to impose the marriage of Mary to his son. English forces mounted a series of raids on Scottish and French territory.[23] In May 1544, the English Earl of Hertford (later Duke of Somerset) raided Edinburgh, and the Scots took Mary to Dunkeld for safety.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1546, Beaton was murdered by Protestant lairds,[25] and on 10 September 1547, nine months after the death of Henry VIII, the Scots suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh. Mary's guardians, fearful for her safety, sent her to Inchmahome Priory for no more than three weeks, and turned to the French for help.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French king, Henry II, proposed to unite France and Scotland by marrying the young queen to his three-year-old son, the Dauphin Francis. On the promise of French military help, and a French dukedom for himself, Arran agreed to the marriage.[27] In February 1548, Mary was moved, again for her safety, to Dumbarton Castle.[28] The English left a trail of devastation behind once more and seized the strategic town of Haddington. In June, the much awaited French help arrived at Leith to besiege and ultimately take Haddington. On 7 July 1548, a Scottish Parliament held at a nunnery near the town agreed to a French marriage treaty.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith her marriage agreement in place, five-year-old Mary was sent to France to spend the next thirteen years at the French court. The French fleet sent by Henry II, commanded by Nicolas de Villegagnon, sailed with Mary from Dumbarton on 7 August 1548 and arrived a week or more later at Roscoff or Saint-Pol-de-Lon in Brittany.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was accompanied by her own court including two illegitimate half-brothers, and the \\"four Marys\\", four girls her own age, all named Mary, who were the daughters of some of the noblest families in Scotland: Beaton, Seton, Fleming, and Livingston.[31] Janet, Lady Fleming, who was Mary Fleming's mother and James V's half-sister, was appointed governess.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nVivacious, beautiful, and clever (according to contemporary accounts), Mary had a promising childhood.[33] At the French court, she was a favourite with everyone, except Henry II's wife Catherine de' Medici.[34] Mary learned to play lute and virginals, was competent in prose, poetry, horsemanship, falconry and needlework, and was taught French, Italian, Latin, Spanish, and Greek, in addition to speaking her native Scots.[35] Her future sister-in-law, Elisabeth of Valois, became a close friend of whom Mary \\"retained nostalgic memories in later life\\".[36] Her maternal grandmother, Antoinette de Bourbon, was another strong influence on her childhood,[37] and acted as one of her principal advisors.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nPortraits of Mary show that she had a small, oval-shaped head, a long, graceful neck, bright auburn hair, hazel-brown eyes, under heavy lowered eyelids and finely arched brows, smooth pale skin, a high forehead, and regular, firm features. She was considered a pretty child and later, as a woman, strikingly attractive.[39] At some point in her infancy or childhood, she caught smallpox, but it did not mark her features.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was eloquent and especially tall by sixteenth-century standards (she attained an adult height of 5?feet 11?inches or 1.80?m),[41] while Henry II's son and heir, Francis, stuttered and was abnormally short. Henry commented that \\"from the very first day they met, my son and she got on as well together as if they had known each other for a long time\\".[42] On 4 April 1558, Mary signed a secret agreement bequeathing Scotland and her claim to England to the French crown if she died without issue.[43] Twenty days later, she married the Dauphin at Notre Dame de Paris, and he became king consort of Scotland.[44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1558, Henry VIII's elder daughter, Mary I of England, was succeeded by her only surviving sibling, Elizabeth I. Under the Third Succession Act, passed in 1543 by the Parliament of England, Elizabeth was recognised as her sister's heir, and Henry VIII's last will and testament had excluded the Stuarts from succeeding to the English throne. Yet, in the eyes of many Catholics, Elizabeth was illegitimate, and Mary Stuart, as the senior descendant of Henry VIII's elder sister, was the rightful queen of England.[46] Henry II of France proclaimed his eldest son and daughter-in-law king and queen of England, and in France the royal arms of England were quartered with those of Francis and Mary.[47] Mary's claim to the English throne was a perennial sticking point between her and Elizabeth I.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Henry II died on 10 July 1559 from injuries sustained in a joust, fifteen-year-old Francis and sixteen-year-old Mary became king and queen of France.[49] Two of the Queen's uncles, the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal of Lorraine, were now dominant in French politics,[50] enjoying an ascendancy called by some historians la tyrannie Guisienne.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Scotland, the power of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation was rising at the expense of Mary's mother, who maintained effective control only through the use of French troops.[52] The Protestant Lords invited English troops into Scotland in an attempt to secure Protestantism, and a Huguenot rising in France, called the Tumult of Amboise, in March 1560 made it impossible for the French to send further support.[53] Instead, the Guise brothers sent ambassadors to negotiate a settlement.[54] On 11 June 1560, their sister (Mary's mother) died, and so the question of future Franco-Scots relations was a pressing one. Under the terms of the Treaty of Edinburgh, signed by Mary's representatives on 6 July 1560, France and England undertook to withdraw troops from Scotland and France recognised Elizabeth's right to rule England. However, the seventeen-year-old Mary, still in France and grieving for her mother, refused to ratify the treaty.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Francis II died on 5 December 1560, of a middle ear infection that led to an abscess in his brain. Mary was grief-stricken.[57] Her mother-in-law, Catherine de' Medici, became regent for the late king's ten-year-old brother Charles IX, who inherited the French throne.[58] Mary returned to Scotland nine months later, arriving in Leith on 19 August 1561.[59] Having lived in France since the age of five, Mary had little direct experience of the dangerous and complex political situation in Scotland.[60] As a devout Catholic, she was regarded with suspicion by many of her subjects, as well as by the Queen of England.[61] Scotland was torn between Catholic and Protestant factions, and Mary's illegitimate half-brother, the Earl of Moray, was a leader of the Protestants.[62] The Protestant reformer John Knox preached against Mary, condemning her for hearing Mass, dancing, and dressing too elaborately.[63] She summoned him to her presence to remonstrate with him unsuccessfully, and later charged him with treason, but he was acquitted and released.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the disappointment of the Catholic party, however, Mary tolerated the newly established Protestant ascendancy,[65] and kept her half-brother Lord Moray as her chief advisor.[66] Her privy council of 16 men, appointed on 6 September 1561, retained those who already held the offices of state and was dominated by the Protestant leaders from the reformation crisis of 1559ÿ1560: the Earls of Argyll, Glencairn, and Moray. Only four of the councillors were Catholic: the Earls of Atholl, Erroll, Montrose, and Huntly, who was Lord Chancellor.[67] Modern historian Jenny Wormald found this remarkable, suggesting that Mary's failure to appoint a council sympathetic to Catholic and French interests was an indication of her focus on the goal of the English throne over the internal problems of Scotland. Even the one significant later addition to the council, Lord Ruthven in December 1563, was another Protestant whom Mary personally disliked.[68] In this, she was acknowledging her lack of effective military power in the face of the Protestant lords, while also following a policy that strengthened her links with England. She joined with Lord Moray in the destruction of Scotland's leading Catholic magnate, Lord Huntly, in 1562 after he led a rebellion in the Highlands against her.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary sent William Maitland of Lethington as an ambassador to the English court to put the case for Mary as the heir presumptive to the English throne. Elizabeth refused to name a potential heir, fearing that to do so would invite conspiracy to displace her with the nominated successor.[70] However, Elizabeth assured Maitland that she knew no one with a better claim than Mary.[71] In late 1561 and early 1562, arrangements were made for the two queens to meet in England at York or Nottingham in August or September 1562, but Elizabeth sent Sir Henry Sidney to cancel in July because of the civil war in France.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary turned her attention to finding a new husband from the royalty of Europe. However, when her uncle, the Cardinal of Lorraine, began negotiations with Archduke Charles of Austria without her consent, she angrily objected and the negotiations foundered.[73] Her own attempt to negotiate a marriage to Don Carlos, the mentally unstable heir apparent of King Philip II of Spain, was rebuffed by Philip.[74] Elizabeth attempted to neutralise Mary by suggesting that she marry English Protestant Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (Sir Henry Sidney's brother-in-law and the English queen's own favourite), whom Elizabeth trusted and thought she could control.[75] She sent an ambassador, Thomas Randolph, to tell Mary that if she would marry an English nobleman, Elizabeth would \\"proceed to the inquisition of her right and title to be our next cousin and heir\\".[76] The proposal came to nothing, not least because the intended bridegroom was unwilling.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, a French poet at Mary's court, Pierre de Boscosel de Chastelard, was apparently besotted by Mary.[78] In early 1563, he was discovered during a security search hidden underneath her bed, apparently planning to surprise her when she was alone and declare his love for her. Mary was horrified and banished him from Scotland. He ignored the edict, and two days later he forced his way into her chamber as she was about to disrobe. She reacted with fury and fear, and when Moray rushed into the room, in reaction to her cries for help, she shouted, \\"Thrust your dagger into the villain!\\", which Moray refused to do, as Chastelard was already under restraint. Chastelard was tried for treason, and beheaded.[79] Maitland claimed that Chastelard's ardour was feigned, and that he was part of a Huguenot plot to discredit Mary by tarnishing her reputation.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary had briefly met her English-born first cousin Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, in February 1561 when she was in mourning for Francis. Darnley's parents, the Earl and Countess of Lennox, who were Scottish aristocrats as well as English landowners, had sent him to France ostensibly to extend their condolences while hoping for a potential match between their son and Mary.[81] Both Mary and Darnley were grandchildren of Margaret Tudor, sister of Henry VIII of England, and patrilineal descendants of the High Stewards of Scotland. Darnley shared a more recent Stewart lineage with the Hamilton family as a descendant of Mary Stewart, Countess of Arran, a daughter of James II of Scotland. They next met on Saturday 17 February 1565 at Wemyss Castle in Scotland,[82] after which Mary fell in love with the \\"long lad\\" (as Queen Elizabeth called himhe was over six feet tall).[83] They married at Holyrood Palace on 29 July 1565, even though both were Catholic and a papal dispensation for the marriage of first cousins had not been obtained.[84][85]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish statesmen William Cecil and the Earl of Leicester had worked to obtain Darnley's licence to travel to Scotland from his home in England.[86] Although her advisors had thus brought the couple together, Elizabeth felt threatened by the marriage, because as descendants of her aunt, both Mary and Darnley were claimants to the English throne[87] and their children, if any, would inherit an even stronger, combined claim.[88] However, Mary's insistence on the marriage seems to have stemmed from passion rather than calculation. The English ambassador Nicholas Throckmorton stated \\"the saying is that surely she [Queen Mary] is bewitched\\",[89] adding that the marriage could only be averted \\"by violence\\".[90] The union infuriated Elizabeth, who felt the marriage should not have gone ahead without her permission, as Darnley was both her cousin and an English subject.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary's marriage to a leading Catholic precipitated Mary's half-brother, the Earl of Moray, to join with other Protestant lords, including Lords Argyll and Glencairn, in open rebellion.[92] Mary set out from Edinburgh on 26 August 1565 to confront them, and on the 30th Moray entered Edinburgh, but left soon afterward having failed to take the castle. Mary returned to Edinburgh the following month to raise more troops.[93] In what became known as the Chaseabout Raid, Mary and her forces and Moray and the rebellious lords roamed around Scotland without ever engaging in direct combat. Mary's numbers were boosted by the release and restoration to favour of Lord Huntly's son, and the return of James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, from exile in France.[94] Unable to muster sufficient support, Moray left Scotland in October for asylum in England.[95] Mary broadened her privy council, bringing in both Catholics (Bishop of Ross John Lesley and provost of Edinburgh Simon Preston of Craigmillar) and Protestants (the new Lord Huntly, Bishop of Galloway Alexander Gordon, John Maxwell of Terregles and Sir James Balfour).[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore long, Darnley grew arrogant. Not content with his position as king consort, he demanded the Crown Matrimonial, which would have made him a co-sovereign of Scotland with the right to keep the Scottish throne for himself if he outlived his wife.[97] Mary refused his request, and their marriage grew strained even though they conceived by October 1565. He was jealous of her friendship with her Catholic private secretary, David Rizzio, who was rumoured to be the father of her child.[98] By March 1566, Darnley had entered into a secret conspiracy with Protestant lords, including the nobles who had rebelled against Mary in the Chaseabout Raid.[99] On 9 March, a group of the conspirators, accompanied by Darnley, murdered Rizzio in front of the pregnant Mary at a dinner party in Holyrood Palace.[100] Over the next two days, a disillusioned Darnley switched sides, and Mary received Moray at Holyrood.[101] On the night of 11ÿ12 March, Darnley and Mary escaped from the palace and took temporary refuge in Dunbar Castle before returning to Edinburgh on 18?March.[102] The former rebels Lords Moray, Argyll and Glencairn were restored to the council.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary's son by Darnley, James, was born on 19 June 1566 in Edinburgh Castle, but the murder of Rizzio led inevitably to the breakdown of her marriage.[104] In October 1566, while staying at Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders, Mary made a journey on horseback of at least four hours each way to visit the Earl of Bothwell at Hermitage Castle, where he lay ill from wounds sustained in a skirmish with border reivers.[105] The ride was later used as evidence by Mary's enemies that the two were lovers, though no suspicions were voiced at the time and Mary had been accompanied by her councillors and guards.[106] Immediately after her return to Jedburgh, she suffered a serious illness that included frequent vomiting, loss of sight, loss of speech, convulsions and periods of unconsciousness. She was thought to be near death or dying. Her recovery from 25 October onwards was credited to the skill of her French physicians.[107] The cause of her illness is unknown; diagnoses include physical exhaustion and mental stress,[108] haemorrhage of a gastric ulcer,[109] and porphyria.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Craigmillar Castle, near Edinburgh, at the end of November 1566, Mary and leading nobles held a meeting to discuss the \\"problem of Darnley\\".[111] Divorce was discussed, but a bond was probably sworn between the lords present to remove Darnley by other means:[112] \\"It was thought expedient and most profitable for the common wealth?... that such a young fool and proud tyrant should not reign or bear rule over them;?... that he should be put off by one way or another; and whosoever should take the deed in hand or do it, they should defend.\\"[113] Darnley feared for his safety, and after the baptism of his son at Stirling shortly before Christmas he went to Glasgow to stay on his father's estates.[114] At the start of the journey, he was afflicted by a fever, possibly smallpox, syphilis, or the result of poison, and he remained ill for some weeks.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late January 1567, Mary prompted her husband to return to Edinburgh. He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o' Field, just within the city wall.[116] Mary visited him daily, so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress.[117] On the night of 9ÿ10 February 1567, Mary visited her husband in the early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household, Bastian Pagez.[118] In the early hours of the morning, an explosion devastated Kirk o' Field, and Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently smothered.[119] There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body.[120][121] Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion.[122] Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours, \\"I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend if I did not?... tell you what all the world is thinking. Men say that, instead of seizing the murderers, you are looking through your fingers while they escape; that you will not seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure, as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity. For myself, I beg you to believe that I would not harbour such a thought.\\"[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of February, Bothwell was generally believed to be guilty of Darnley's assassination.[124] Lennox, Darnley's father, demanded that Bothwell be tried before the Estates of Parliament, to which Mary agreed, but Lennox's request for a delay to gather evidence was denied. In the absence of Lennox, and with no evidence presented, Bothwell was acquitted after a seven-hour trial on 12 April.[125] A week later, Bothwell managed to convince more than two dozen lords and bishops to sign the Ainslie Tavern Bond, in which they agreed to support his aim to marry the queen.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 21 and 23 April 1567, Mary visited her son at Stirling for the last time. On her way back to Edinburgh on 24 April, Mary was abducted, willingly or not, by Lord Bothwell and his men and taken to Dunbar Castle, where he may have raped her.[127] On 6 May, Mary and Bothwell returned to Edinburgh and on 15 May, at either Holyrood Palace or Holyrood Abbey, they were married according to Protestant rites.[128] Bothwell and his first wife, Jean Gordon, who was the sister of Lord Huntly, had divorced twelve days previously.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally Mary believed that many nobles supported her marriage, but things soon turned sour between the newly elevated Bothwell (created Duke of Orkney) and his former peers, and the marriage proved to be deeply unpopular. Catholics considered the marriage unlawful, since they did not recognise Bothwell's divorce or the validity of the Protestant service. Both Protestants and Catholics were shocked that Mary should marry the man accused of murdering her husband.[130] The marriage was tempestuous, and Mary became despondent.[131] Twenty-six Scottish peers, known as the confederate lords, turned against Mary and Bothwell, raising an army against them. Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at Carberry Hill on 15 June, but there was no battle as Mary's forces dwindled away through desertion during negotiations.[132] Bothwell was given safe passage from the field, and the lords took Mary to Edinburgh, where crowds of spectators denounced her as an adulteress and murderer.[133] The following night, she was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle, on an island in the middle of Loch Leven.[134] Between 20 and 23 July, Mary miscarried twins.[135] On 24 July, she was forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son James.[136] Moray was made regent,[137] while Bothwell was driven into exile. He was imprisoned in Denmark, became insane and died in 1578.[138]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 May 1568, Mary escaped from Loch Leven Castle with the aid of George Douglas, brother of Sir William Douglas, the castle's owner.[139] Managing to raise an army of 6,000 men, she met Moray's smaller forces at the Battle of Langside on 13 May.[140] Defeated, she fled south; after spending the night at Dundrennan Abbey, she crossed the Solway Firth into England by fishing boat on 16 May.[141] She landed at Workington in Cumberland in the north of England and stayed overnight at Workington Hall.[142] On 18 May, local officials took her into protective custody at Carlisle Castle.[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary apparently expected Elizabeth to help her regain her throne.[144] Elizabeth was cautious, ordering an inquiry into the conduct of the confederate lords and the question of whether Mary was guilty of Darnley's murder.[145] In mid-July 1568, English authorities moved Mary to Bolton Castle, because it was further from the Scottish border but not too close to London.[146] A commission of inquiry, or conference as it was known, was held in York and later Westminster between October 1568 and January 1569.[147] In Scotland, her supporters fought a civil war against Regent Moray and his successors.[148]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an anointed queen, Mary refused to acknowledge the power of any court to try her and refused to attend the inquiry at York personally (she sent representatives), but Elizabeth forbade her attendance anyway.[149] As evidence against Mary, Moray presented the so-called casket letters[150]eight unsigned letters purportedly from Mary to Bothwell, two marriage contracts, and a love sonnet or sonnets said to have been found in a silver-gilt casket just less than one foot (30?cm) long, decorated with the monogram of King Francis II.[151] Mary denied writing them, arguing that her handwriting was not difficult to imitate,[152] and insisted they were forgeries.[153] They are widely believed to be crucial as to whether Mary shares the guilt for Darnley's murder.[154] The chair of the commission of inquiry, the Duke of Norfolk, described them as horrible letters and diverse fond ballads, and sent copies to Elizabeth, saying that if they were genuine they might prove Mary's guilt.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe authenticity of the casket letters has been the source of much controversy among historians. It is impossible now to prove either way. The originals, written in French, were probably destroyed in 1584 by Mary's son.[156] The surviving copies, in French or translated into English, do not form a complete set. There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English, Scots, French, and Latin from the 1570s.[157] Other documents scrutinised included Bothwell's divorce from Jean Gordon. Moray had sent a messenger in September to Dunbar to get a copy of the proceedings from the town's registers.[158]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary's biographers, such as Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, and John Guy, have come to the conclusion that either the documents were complete forgeries,[159] or incriminating passages were inserted into genuine letters,[160] or that the letters were written to Bothwell by some other person or by Mary to some other person.[161] Guy points out that the letters are disjointed, and that the French language and grammar employed in the sonnets are too poor for a writer with Mary's education.[162] However, certain phrases of the letters (including verses in the style of Ronsard) and certain characteristics of style would be compatible with known writings of Mary.[163]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe casket letters did not appear publicly until the Conference of 1568, although the Scottish privy council had seen them by December 1567.[164] Mary had been forced to abdicate and held captive for the best part of a year in Scotland. The letters were never made public to support her imprisonment and forced abdication. Historian Jenny Wormald believes this reluctance on the part of the Scots to produce the letters, and their destruction in 1584, whatever their content, constitute proof that they contained real evidence against Mary,[165] whereas Weir thinks it demonstrates the lords required time to fabricate them.[166] At least some of Mary's contemporaries who saw the letters had no doubt that they were genuine. Among them was the Duke of Norfolk,[167] who secretly conspired to marry Mary in the course of the commission, although he denied it when Elizabeth alluded to his marriage plans, saying \\"he meant never to marry with a person, where he could not be sure of his pillow\\".[168]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of the commissioners accepted the casket letters as genuine after a study of their contents and comparison of the penmanship with examples of Mary's handwriting.[169] Elizabeth, as she had wished, concluded the inquiry with a verdict that nothing was proven, either against the confederate lords or Mary.[170] For overriding political reasons, Elizabeth wished neither to convict nor acquit Mary of murder, and there was never any intention to proceed judicially; the conference was intended as a political exercise. In the end, Moray returned to Scotland as its regent, and Mary remained in custody in England. Elizabeth had succeeded in maintaining a Protestant government in Scotland, without either condemning or releasing her fellow sovereign.[171] In Fraser's opinion, it was one of the strangest \\"trials\\" in legal history, ending with no finding of guilt against either party with one let home to Scotland while the other remained in custody.[172]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 26 January 1569, Mary was moved to Tutbury Castle[175] and placed in the custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury and his formidable wife Bess of Hardwick.[176] Elizabeth considered Mary's designs on the English throne to be a serious threat and so confined her to Shrewsbury's properties, including Tutbury, Sheffield Castle, Wingfield Manor and Chatsworth House,[177] all located in the interior of England halfway between Scotland and London, and distant from the sea.[178] Mary was permitted her own domestic staff, which never numbered fewer than sixteen,[179] and needed thirty carts to transport her belongings from house to house.[180] Her chambers were decorated with fine tapestries and carpets as well as her cloth of state on which she had the French phrase En ma fin est mon commencement (\\"In my end lies my beginning\\") embroidered.[181] Her bedlinen was changed daily,[182] and her own chefs prepared meals with a choice of thirty-two dishes served on silver plates.[183] She was occasionally allowed outside under strict supervision,[184] spent seven summers at the spa town of Buxton, and spent much of her time doing embroidery.[185] Her health declined, perhaps through porphyria or lack of exercise, and by the 1580s she had severe rheumatism in her limbs, rendering her lame.[186]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1569, Elizabeth attempted to mediate the restoration of Mary in return for guarantees of the Protestant religion, but a convention held at Perth rejected the deal overwhelmingly.[187] Norfolk continued to scheme for a marriage with Mary, and Elizabeth imprisoned him in the Tower of London between October 1569 and August 1570.[188] Early the following year, Moray was assassinated. Moray's death coincided with a rebellion in the North of England, led by Catholic earls, which persuaded Elizabeth that Mary was a threat. English troops intervened in the Scottish civil war, consolidating the power of the anti-Marian forces.[189] Elizabeth's principal secretaries Sir Francis Walsingham and William Cecil, Lord Burghley, watched Mary carefully with the aid of spies placed in Mary's household.[190]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1571, Cecil and Walsingham uncovered the Ridolfi Plot, which was a plan to replace Elizabeth with Mary with the help of Spanish troops and the Duke of Norfolk. Norfolk was executed, and the English Parliament introduced a bill barring Mary from the throne, to which Elizabeth refused to give royal assent.[191] To discredit Mary, the casket letters were published in London.[192] Plots centred on Mary continued. Pope Gregory XIII endorsed one plan in the latter half of the 1570s to marry her to the governor of the Low Countries and half-brother of Philip II of Spain, Don John of Austria, who was supposed to organise the invasion of England from the Spanish Netherlands.[193] After the Throckmorton Plot of 1583, Walsingham introduced the Bond of Association and the Act for the Queen's Safety, which sanctioned the killing of anyone who plotted against Elizabeth and aimed to prevent a putative successor from profiting from her murder.[194]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1584, Mary proposed an \\"Association\\" with her son, James. She announced that she was ready to stay in England, to renounce the Pope's bull of excommunication and to retire, abandoning her pretensions to the English Crown. She also offered to join an offensive league against France. For Scotland, she proposed a general amnesty, agreed that James should marry with Elizabeth's knowledge and agreed that there should be no change in religion. Her only condition was the immediate alleviation of the conditions of her captivity. James went along with the idea for a while but then rejected it and signed an alliance treaty with Elizabeth, abandoning his mother.[195] Elizabeth also rejected the Association because she did not trust Mary to cease plotting against her during the negotiations.[196]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1585, William Parry was convicted of plotting to assassinate Elizabeth, without Mary's knowledge, though her agent Thomas Morgan was implicated.[197] In April, Mary was placed in the stricter custody of Sir Amias Paulet,[198] and at Christmas she was moved to a moated manor house at Chartley.[199]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 August 1586, after being implicated in the Babington Plot, Mary was arrested while out riding and taken to Tixall.[200] In a successful attempt to entrap her, Walsingham had deliberately arranged for Mary's letters to be smuggled out of Chartley. Mary was misled into thinking her letters were secure, while in reality they were deciphered and read by Walsingham.[201] From these letters it was clear that Mary had sanctioned the attempted assassination of Elizabeth.[202] She was moved to Fotheringhay Castle in a four-day journey ending on 25 September, and in October was put on trial for treason under the Act for the Queen's Safety before a court of 36 noblemen,[203] including Cecil, Shrewsbury, and Walsingham.[204][205] Spirited in her defence, Mary denied the charges.[206] She told her triers, \\"Look to your consciences and remember that the theatre of the whole world is wider than the kingdom of England\\".[207] She protested that she had been denied the opportunity to review the evidence, that her papers had been removed from her, that she was denied access to legal counsel and that as a foreign anointed queen she had never been an English subject and thus could not be convicted of treason.[208]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was convicted on 25 October and sentenced to death with only one commissioner, Lord Zouche, expressing any form of dissent.[209] Nevertheless, Elizabeth hesitated to order her execution, even in the face of pressure from the English Parliament to carry out the sentence. She was concerned that the killing of a queen set a discreditable precedent and was fearful of the consequences, especially if, in retaliation, Mary's son, James, formed an alliance with the Catholic powers and invaded England.[210] Elizabeth asked Paulet, Mary's final custodian, if he would contrive a clandestine way to \\"shorten the life\\" of Mary, which he refused to do on the grounds that he would not make \\"a shipwreck of my conscience, or leave so great a blot on my poor posterity\\".[211] On 1 February 1587, Elizabeth signed the death warrant, and entrusted it to William Davison, a privy councillor.[212] On 3 February,[213] ten members of the Privy Council of England, having been summoned by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge, decided to carry out the sentence at once.[214]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Fotheringhay on the evening of 7 February 1587, Mary was told that she was to be executed the next morning.[215] She spent the last hours of her life in prayer, distributing her belongings to her household, and writing her will and a letter to the King of France.[216] The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black. It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block, a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools, for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were there to witness the execution.[217] The executioners (one named Bull and his assistant) knelt before her and asked forgiveness, as it was typical for the executioner to ask the pardon of the one being put to death. She replied, \\"I forgive you with all my heart, for now, I hope, you shall make an end of all my troubles.\\"[218] Her servants, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle, and the executioners helped Mary to remove her outer garments, revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson brown, the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church,[219] with a black satin bodice and black trimmings.[220] As she disrobed she smiled and said that she \\"never had such grooms before?... nor ever put off her clothes before such a company\\".[221] She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold, knelt down on the cushion in front of the block, on which she positioned her head, and stretched out her arms. Her last words were, In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum (\\"Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit\\").[222]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary was not beheaded with a single strike. The first blow missed her neck and struck the back of her head. The second blow severed the neck, except for a small bit of sinew, which the executioner cut through using the axe. Afterwards, he held her head aloft and declared, \\"God save the Queen.\\" At that moment, the auburn tresses in his hand turned out to be a wig and the head fell to the ground, revealing that Mary had very short, grey hair.[223] A small dog owned by the queen is said to have emerged from hiding among her skirts[224]though eye-witness Emanuel Tomascon does not include it in his report.[225] Items supposedly worn or carried by Mary at her execution are of doubtful provenance;[226] contemporary accounts state that all her clothing, the block, and everything touched by her blood was burnt in the fireplace of the Great Hall to obstruct relic-hunters.[224]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the news of the execution reached Elizabeth, she became indignant and asserted that Davison had disobeyed her instructions not to part with the warrant and that the Privy Council had acted without her authority.[227] Elizabeth's vacillation and deliberately vague instructions gave her plausible deniability to attempt to avoid the direct stain of Mary's blood.[228] Davison was arrested, thrown into the Tower of London, and found guilty of misprision. He was released nineteen months later after Cecil and Walsingham interceded on his behalf.[229]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary's request to be buried in France was refused by Elizabeth.[230] Her body was embalmed and left in a secure lead coffin until her burial, in a Protestant service, at Peterborough Cathedral in late July 1587.[231] Her entrails, removed as part of the embalming process, were buried secretly within Fotheringhay Castle.[232] Her body was exhumed in 1612, when her son, King James VI and I, ordered that she be reinterred in Westminster Abbey in a chapel opposite the tomb of Elizabeth.[233] In 1867, her tomb was opened in an attempt to ascertain the resting place of James I; he was ultimately found with Henry VII, but many of her other descendants, including Elizabeth of Bohemia, Prince Rupert of the Rhine and the children of Anne, Queen of Great Britain, were interred in her vault.[234]\\r\\n\\r\\nAssessments of Mary in the sixteenth century divided between Protestant reformers such as George Buchanan and John Knox, who vilified her mercilessly, and Catholic apologists such as Adam Blackwood, who praised, defended and eulogised her.[235] After the accession of James I in England, historian William Camden wrote an officially sanctioned biography that drew from original documents. It condemned Buchanan's work as an invention,[236] and \\"emphasized Mary's evil fortunes rather than her evil character\\".[237] Differing interpretations persisted into the eighteenth century: William Robertson and David Hume argued that the casket letters were genuine and that Mary was guilty of adultery and murder, while William Tytler argued the reverse.[238] In the latter half of the twentieth century, the work of Antonia Fraser was acclaimed as \\"more objective?... free from the excesses of adulation or attack\\" that had characterised older biographies,[239] and her contemporaries Gordon Donaldson and Ian B. Cowan also produced more balanced works.[240] Historian Jenny Wormald concluded that Mary was a tragic failure, who was unable to cope with the demands placed on her,[241] but hers was a rare dissenting view in a post-Fraser tradition that Mary was a pawn in the hands of scheming noblemen.[242] There is no concrete proof of her complicity in Darnley's murder or of a conspiracy with Bothwell. Such accusations rest on assumptions,[243] and Buchanan's biography is today discredited as \\"almost complete fantasy\\".[244] Mary's courage at her execution helped establish her popular image as the heroic victim in a dramatic tragedy.[245]","input":"How old was mary queen of scots when she took the throne?"},{"output":"Stephen J.

Bisciotti's involvement in the sports business has brought more attention to his once low-profile company.\\r\\nOn March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49% of the Ravens to Bisciotti. In the deal, Bisciotti had an option to purchase the remaining 51% for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 9, 2004 the NFL approved Steve Bisciotti's purchase of the majority stake in the club.[2]\\r\\nOne of the first projects Bisciotti directed as owner of the Ravens was to build the team's state-of-the-art training and practice facility, dubbed \\"The Castle,\\" which opened in October 2004.\\r\\nBisciotti fired Brian Billick after the 2007 season, although Billick's eight years as the Ravens' head coach included the team's win in Super Bowl XXXV. He then surprised many observers by selecting John Harbaugh as his new coach, despite Harbaugh's peak of previous experience being a single year as a defensive backs coach after several successful years as the special teams coach for the Philadelphia Eagles.\\r\\nIn 2012, the Baltimore Ravens capitalized off a 10-6 season to go on to win Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers on February 3, 2013.[6][7]\\r\\nIn 2005, Bisciotti ranked 378 among the Forbes 400, a list of the richest Americans.[8]\\r\\nIn 2009, Aerotek, the company Bisciotti co-founded, reached a $1.2 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of more than 1,000 Aerotek workers who worked at a Verizon Internet Services call center in Martinsburg, West Virginia, which was closed in December 2006. The company then was sued to settle claims that the workers were not paid in a timely fashion for accrued personal time and were not paid all of the wages that were due in accordance with the West Virginia Wage Payment and Collection Act and Fair Labor Standards Act, according to Berkeley County Circuit Court records.[9]\\r\\nBisciotti is a devout Roman Catholic, and on the board member for both Associated Catholic Charities and Mother Seton Academy.[10] He and his wife Rene (Foote) have two sons, Jason and Jack. The family lives on the Point Field Landing of the Severn River in Maryland.","input":"Who is the owner of the baltimore ravens?"},{"output":"steam engines","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n|-\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mount Washington Cog Railway, also known as the Cog, is the world's first mountain-climbing cog railway (rack-and-pinion railway).  The railway is still in operation, climbing Mount Washington in New Hampshire, USA. It uses a Marsh rack system and one or two steam locomotives and six biodiesel powered locomotives to carry tourists to the top of the mountain.  Its track is built to 4?ft?8?in (1,422?mm) gauge, which is technically a narrow gauge, as it is a ?1?2-inch (12.7?mm) less than 4?ft?8?1?2?in (1,435?mm) standard gauge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the second steepest rack railway in the world after the Pilatus Railway in Switzerland,[2] with an average grade of over 25% and a maximum grade of 37.41%. The railway is approximately 3 miles (4.8?km) long and ascends Mount Washington's western slope, beginning at an elevation of approximately 2,700 feet (820?m) above sea level and ending just short of the mountain's summit peak of 6,288 feet (1,917?m). The train ascends the mountain at 2.8 miles per hour (4.5?km/h) and descends at 4.6?mph (7.4?km/h). It takes approximately 65 minutes to ascend and 40 minutes to descend, although the diesel engine can go up in as little as 37 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the Mount Washington Cog Railway is in Thompson and Meserve's Purchase, with the part of the railway nearest to Mount Washington's summit being in Sargent's Purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe railway was built by Sylvester Marsh[3] who grew up in Campton. Marsh came up with the idea while climbing the mountain in 1852.[4] His plan was treated as insane. Local tradition says that the state legislature voted permission based on a consensus that harm resulting from operating it was no issue? since the design was attempting the impossible? but benefits were guaranteed. He was putting up $5,000 of his own money, and that, plus whatever else he could raise, would be spent locally, including building the Fabyan House hotel at nearby Fabyan Station to accommodate the expected tourists. The railway is sometimes called \\"Railway to the Moon\\", because one state legislator remarked during the proceedings that Marsh should be given a charter, not merely up Mount Washington, but also to the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsh obtained a charter for the road on June 25, 1858, but the American Civil War prevented any action until May 1866.[4] He developed a prototype locomotive and a short demonstration section of track, then found investors and started construction.[citation needed] The route closely followed a mountain trail that had been established earlier in the century by Ethan Allen Crawford.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the railroad's incomplete state, the first paying customers started riding on August 14, 1868, and the construction reached the summit in July 1869.[4] The early locomotives - represented today by the restored display locomotive, #1 Old Peppersass[6] - all had vertical boilers, like many stationary steam engines of the time; the boilers were mounted to the locomotives' frames with twin trunnions, allowing them to pivot as the locomotive and coach climbed the grade, permitting gravity to always keep the boiler vertically oriented, no matter what the gradient of the track. Later designs introduced horizontal boilers, slanted so that they remain close to horizontal on the steeply graded track.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant visited New England to escape the heat of summer in Washington, D.C.  During his tour he rode the cog railway to the top of Mount Washington.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nSylvester Marsh died in 1884 and control of the Cog passed to the Concord & Montreal Railroad, which ran it until 1889 when the Boston & Maine Railroad took over.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nControl by the Teagues began in 1931 when Col. Henry N. Teague bought the Cog. He died in 1951, and Arthur S. Teague became general manager, then gained ownership in 1961. (Arthur Teague was the colonel's protg, but no relation.) After he died in 1967, the ownership passed to his wife, Ellen Crawford Teague, who ran the Cog as the world's first woman president of a railway. In 1983, Mrs. Teague sold the railway to a group of New Hampshire businessmen. Since 1986, the Cog Railway has been controlled and owned by Wayne Presby and Joel Bedor of Littleton, New Hampshire. The Bedor and Presby families also owned the Mount Washington Hotel and Resort in Bretton Woods for the period 1991ÿ2006. In 1995, the railway appointed Charles Kenison the General Manager. These individuals were responsible for a complete revitalization of the railroad, with the assistance of Al LaPrade, a mechanical engineer whose career began at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.[1][8][10] The Cog has been in continuous operation since 1869, with service interruptions only during the World Wars.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 2008, the Cog introduced its first diesel locomotive. The Great Recession and the 2000s energy crisis led to fewer passengers, and the Cog sought to cut costs with the diesel, which could make three round trips for the cost of one steam train round trip. [11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2016, the owner of the Cog proposed building a 35-room hotel along the line, about a mile below the summit and two miles above the station. They propose to open the facility in 2019 for the 150th anniversary of the train.[12] The proposal quickly drew public opposition due to its location in the alpine zone of the mountain.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving the depot c. 1880s\\r\\n\\r\\nPartway up the mountain\\r\\n\\r\\nArrival on the summit\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Devil's shingles\\" down\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early days of the railway's construction, the workers wanted to minimize time when climbing and descending the ramp, so they invented slideboards fitting over the cog rack and providing enough room for themselves and their tools. These boards? no two were exactly alike? were approximately 35?in (90?cm) long by 9.8?in (25?cm) wide, made of wood with hand-forged iron and with two long, hardwood handles usually attached at the down-mountain end. The average time for the descent of the mountain using these boards was about 15?minutes. The record was 2:45, an average speed above 62?mph (100?km/h).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Devil's shingles\\" were banned in 1906 after the accidental death of an employee. Later, the design of the rack was changed so that the old braking mechanism could no longer grip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of two major accidents in the railway's history occurred in 1929, involving locomotive #1 (first named Hero and later Old Peppersass[6] because of its vertical boiler's resemblance to a pepper sauce bottle). This locomotive was used to build the railway and was lost for many years, as it had been moved about the country and placed on display at numerous exhibitions. The owners of the railway at the time (the Boston & Maine Railroad) decided to restore Old Peppersass and make a commemorative trip for the railway's 60th anniversary. During the ascent, however, the locomotive's front axle broke and the locomotive began descending the mountain at high speed. All but one of its crew jumped to safety (though some suffered broken bones), but one man did not escape and died. The locomotive broke into pieces, but the boiler did not rupture, and the pieces were later reassembled to reconstruct the locomotive for static display. It is now located at the Cog Railway Base Station.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 17, 1967, eight passengers were killed and seventy-two injured when Engine #3 derailed at the Skyline switch, about a mile below the summit. The engine rolled off the trestle while the uncoupled passenger car slid several hundred feet into a large rock. An investigation revealed that the Skyline switch had not been properly configured for the descending train. The railway nonetheless has a solid safety record, having taken over five million people to the summit during its existence.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cog railway designs and builds all of its locomotives and passenger coaches at the company shops located at the base of Mount Washington.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach train consists of a locomotive pushing a single passenger car up the mountain, descending the mountain by going in reverse. Both locomotive and car were originally equipped with a ratchet and pawl mechanism engaged during the climb that prevents any roll-back; during descent, both locomotive and car are braked. Recent improvements in design have replaced the ratchet (gear and pawl mechanism) with sprag clutches and disc brake assemblies. Most of the locomotives were made by the Manchester Locomotive Works.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rack rail design used is one of Marsh's own inventions, using a ladder-like rack with open bar rungs engaged by the teeth of the cog wheel. This system allows snow and debris to fall through the rack, rather than lodging in it.[18] A similar design, called the Riggenbach rack system, was invented by engineer Niklaus Riggenbach in Switzerland at about the same time. The Swiss Consul to the United States visited Marsh while constructing the railway up Mount Washington, and his enthusiastic reports persuaded the Swiss government to commission Riggenbach to build the Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn on Mount Rigi, which opened on May 21, 1871.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, there was no way for two trains to pass one another on the Mount Washington Cog Railway. In 1941, a nine-motion switch was invented, and two spur sidings were added, each long enough to divert two descending trains so that climbing trains could continue to the summit, enabling more round trips per day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, work was completed replacing the lower Waumbek Switch and Siding with an 1,800-foot (550?m) passing loop equipped with electric and hydraulically powered automated switches. These switches are powered by batteries and recharged by solar panels. One switch is located at each end of the loop, allowing ascending and descending trains to pass one another.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, work began on another switch and siding at the summit of Mount Washington. When completed, the new switch will allow trains to pass one another at the summit of the mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, work began on the first diesel locomotive to be powered with biodiesel, with the assistance of a retired mechanical engineer from the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.[21] By 2013, the railway had completed the construction of five of these locomotives.  Work was completed on a sixth biodiesel in June 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common trips on the Cog Railway are between the two main stations, one at the summit and the other adjacent to the operators' logistical and repair base.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2003 to 2006, \\"ski trains\\" ran, stopping at an intermediate station, from which passengers could ski down to the Base Station.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cog Railway track crosses a hiking trail a relatively short distance below the summit of Mount Washington, and some hikers wait for the next train in order to moon the passengers. This practice is known as \\"Mooning the Cog.\\"  Several hikers were arrested for performing this act in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess to the base station by car is by three routes, each culminating with the upper portion of the dead-end Cog Base Road. The advertised, roughly eastbound route uses the Base Road's full length from Bretton Woods. An especially scenic route, initially southbound from U.S. Route 2, follows Jefferson Notch Road, a narrow dirt road with hairpin turns; it rises 1,500 feet (460?m) to the pass, at 3,000 feet (910?m) above sea level, between Mount Jefferson in the Presidential Range and Mount Dartmouth, before descending to its junction with the Base Road. The Jefferson Notch Road is closed to wheeled vehicles in winterand usually before and afterand used primarily by snowmobiles. The roughly northbound route from U.S. Route 302 in Crawford Notch via Mt. Clinton Road is also closed in the winter to vehicular traffic. Operations of trains all winter began in 2004ÿ2005, and the Cog Base Road is plowed and sanded all winter to allow tourists, skiers, and employees access to the Base Station.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steam locomotives on the railway generate large amounts of smoke, nicknamed Cog Smog.[22] The railway is exempted from the state's air-pollution-control law (RSA 125-C:20),[23] which exempts \\"any steam locomotives and engines or replacements thereof used in connection with the operation of a railroad or railway which were in operation or on order prior to January 1, 1973, and are located entirely within the state.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEach 3?mi (4.8?km) steam locomotive ride burns 1 short ton (0.91?t) of coal and consumes 1,000 US gallons (3,800?l) of water.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne steam locomotive was converted to oil firing in 2008.[25]\\r\\nThe attempt to oil fire the existing steam locomotives failed and in 2008 the railway introduced its first diesel locomotive, designed and built by the railroad staff.  Since 2008, four more diesels were completed (M-2 and M-3 in 2009, M-4 in 2011, and M-5 in 2013). All the new diesel hydraulic locomotives are operated on B20 (20% biodiesel blend) during the summer season. The company declared that the primary reason the new diesels were built was to reduce the visual pollution caused by the coal-fired steam locomotives, to lower emissions, and to increase the length of time that passengers could spend at the summit of Mount Washington.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach 3?mi (4.8?km) diesel locomotive ride burns approximately 18 US gallons (68?l) of B20 (20% biodiesel blend) fuel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe locomotives push passenger cars that have a capacity of 70 riders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cog Railway also rosters eight wooden coaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 441626N 711953W? / ?44.273783N 71.331482W? / 44.273783; -71.331482","input":"What powered the original locomotives on mount washington cog railway?"},{"output":"active troops (650,000 in 2011)","context":"","input":"What is the size of south korea military?"},{"output":"Portland, Oregon","context":"Mr. Holland's Opus is a 1995 American drama film directed by Stephen Herek, produced by Ted Field, Robert W. Cort, and Michael Nolin, and written by Patrick Sheane Duncan.[2] The film stars Richard Dreyfuss in the title role of Glenn Holland, a high-school music teacher who aspires to write his own composition.  The cast also includes Glenne Headly, Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, and Jay Thomas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay. Richard Dreyfuss also received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ÿ Motion Picture Drama and the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Portland, Oregon in 1965, Glenn Holland is a talented musician and composer who has been relatively successful in the exhausting life of a professional musical performer. However, in an attempt to enjoy more free time with his young wife, Iris, and to enable him to compose a piece of orchestral music, the 30-year-old Holland accepts a teaching position at John F. Kennedy High School.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately for Holland, he is soon forced to realize that his position as a music teacher makes him a marginalized figure in the faculty's hierarchy. Many of his colleagues, and some in Kennedy High's administration, including the school's vice principal Gene Wolters, resent Holland and question the value and importance of music education given the school's strained budget. However, he quickly begins to win many of his colleagues over. Holland finds success using rock and roll as a way to make classical music more accessible to his students.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolland's lack of quality time with Iris becomes problematic when their son Coltrane (Cole), is found to be deaf. Holland reacts with hostility to the news that he can never teach the joys of music to his own child. Iris willingly learns American Sign Language to communicate with her son, but Holland resists. This causes further estrangement within his family.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the years progress, Holland grows closer to his students at Kennedy High and more distant from his own son. He addresses a series of challenges created by people who are either hesitant or hostile towards the concept of musical excellence within the walls of the average American high school. He inspires numerous students, but never has private time for himself or his family, delaying the completion of his own orchestral composition. Eventually, he reaches an age when it is too late to have a realistic chance of finding financial backing, or ever having it performed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, the adversaries of the Kennedy High music program win a decisive institutional victory. Wolters, now promoted to principal, faces budget cuts from the board of education.  He responds by eliminating music, as well as art and drama, from the school curriculum, leading to Holland's early retirement. Holland realizes that his career in music is likely over, thinking that his former students have mostly forgotten him and is dejected at his failure ever to have his composition, which he views as his life's work, performed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his final day as a teacher, Holland enters the school auditorium, where his professional life is surprisingly redeemed. Hearing that their beloved teacher is retiring, hundreds of his former students have secretly returned to the school to celebrate his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolland's orchestral piece, never before heard in public, has been put before the musicians by his wife and son. One of his most musically challenged students, Gertrude Lang, now the Governor of Oregon, takes the podium and explains to Holland that the symphony he wrote is not his only legacy... it's the people he has inspired and taught, all of the people he has helped to make a better person, that is his true legacy. Gov. Lang then sits among the musicians -- drawn from Holland's students over the decades -- with her clarinet, but not before asking Holland to step on up on stage and serve as their conductor for the premiere performance of Mr. Holland's Opus (\\"The American Symphony\\"). A proud Iris and Cole look on, appreciating the affection and respect that Holland receives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie was written by Patrick Sheane Duncan, directed by Stephen Herek, and was filmed in and around Portland, Oregon, with many exterior and interior scenes taking place at Ulysses S.

Kamen also wrote An American Symphony (\\"Mr. Holland's Opus\\"), the work on which Mr. Holland is shown working throughout the movie.  Kamen's arrangement won the 1997 Grammy for Best Instrumental Arrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo soundtrack albums were released for this film in January 1996. One is the original motion picture score, and includes all of the original music written for the film by Michael Kamen. The second album is a collection of popular music featured in the film:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, gross domestic takings totaled US$82,569,971. International takings are estimated at US$23,700,000, for a gross worldwide takings of $106,269,971.[4] Rental totals reached $36,550,000 in the US. Although the film is included among 1995 box-office releases (it ranks as the 14th-most successful film of that year), it was only released in a few theatres in New York and Los Angeles on December 29, 1995, because Disney felt, accurately, that Richard Dreyfuss' performance had a good chance of getting an Oscar nomination if it beat that year's in-theatre deadline.\\r\\n\\r\\nRotten Tomatoes gave the film a 74% Fresh rating.[5] CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \\"A+\\" grade.

The first season introduces the main character, Meredith Grey, as she enrolls in Seattle Grace Hospital's internship program and faces unexpected challenges and surprises. Season one had nine series regulars, four of whom have been part of the main cast ever since. The season initially served as a mid-season replacement for the legal drama Boston Legal, airing in the Sunday night time slot at 10:00, after Desperate Housewives. Although no clip shows have been produced for this season, the events that occur are recapped in \\"Straight to Heart\\", a clip-show which aired one week before the winter holiday hiatus of the second season ended. The season was officially released on DVD as two-disc Region 1 box set under the title of Grey's Anatomy: Season One on February 14, 2006, by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.\\r\\nThe series' protagonist and title character is Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), who is accepted into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. She joins the program as an intern and is assigned to work under their resident Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), along with fellow interns an extremely competitive Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), an insecure Dr. George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), ex model Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), and an arrogant Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers). The surgical wing is primarily supervised by the Chief of Surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) is the head of Cardio surgery. Meredith is in a romantic relationship with her attending Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) a stranger she had a one-night stand with, and is the daughter of the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), who now suffers from Alzheimer's.\\r\\nThe season's reviews and critiques were hugely positive, and the series received several awards and nominations for the cast and crew including three nominations at the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards including Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for Oh. The series also received three nominations at the Golden Globe Award with the series itself being nominated for Best Drama Series, Dempsey nominated for Best Actor in a Drama Series Oh winning the Best Supporting Actress while the entire cast was nominated in the Outstanding Cast ÿ Drama Series category. Oh also won the Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series at the 12th Screen Actors Guild Awards. Chambers and Pompeo were nominated Choice TV Breakout Performances at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards. Peter Horton and Jeffrey Melman were also nominated for the Best Directing ÿ Drama Series, Night for A Hard Day's Night and Into You Like a Train respectively at the 58th Directors Guild of America Awards.\\r\\nThe first five episodes of the second season were conceived, written and shot to air as the final five episodes of the first season,[1] but aired during the 2005-2006 season due to the high number of viewers that watched \\"Who's Zoomin' Who?\\", the season's highest-rated episode with 22.22 million viewers tuning in. The series was chosen in the top ten for several 2005 \\"best of television\\" lists, including USA Today, San Jose Mercury News, The New York Times, The Boston Globe and Chicago Tribune\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was created by Shonda Rhimes and was aired on the ABC Network in the U.S. The season was produced by Touchstone Television, currently ABC Studios,[2] The Mark Gordon Company, ShondaLand Production Company, and was distributed by Buena Vista International, Inc.. The season's executive producers were Rhimes, Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, James D. Parriott, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, and Mark Wilding. The staff writers were Rhimes, Parriott, Ann Hamilton, Vernoff, Kip Koenig, Mimi Schmir, Gabrielle Stanton, and Harry Werksman, Jr.. The directors throughout the season were Peter Horton, Tony Goldwyn, Adam Davidson. John David Coles, Scott Brazil, Darnell Martin, Sarah Pia Anderson, and Wendey Stanzler. Rhimes served as the season's show runner. She and Horton, who wrote and directed the first two episodes respectively, would also have written and directed the season's final two episodes, had they not been transferred into the second season.[3]\\r\\nThe show was announced in late 2004 as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal.[4] It was originally scheduled to run in the Boston Legal time slot for just four weeks, but after receiving high ratings remained in the time slot for the remainder of the season.[5] ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: \\"Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May.\\"[6] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass.[7] Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: \\"I think there was a need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're at right now. Medical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, she found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it.\\"[5] Rhimes explained that she had found the idea of a show about smart women competing against one another an interesting one.[5]\\r\\nNine actors had star billing in the show's first season. Series creator Shonda Rhimes wanted a diverse cast, and so created characters without pre-specified races.[8] Determined not to have a show in which \\"all the extras are white, except the lone janitor\\", she has created what The New York Times has called \\"one of the most colorful backgrounds in television\\".[9] Rhimes used a \\"blind-casting\\" technique, which resulted in several roles going to actors of different racial backgrounds than first envisioned. Isaiah Washington, eventually cast as Preston Burke, was originally considered for the role of Derek Shepherd, while Burke was initially to be played by a white actor who dropped out at the last moment. Chandra Wilson was cast in the role of Miranda Bailey, who Rhimes had imagined as a blonde until auditioning Wilson. The Campus have observed that the Grey's Anatomy cast is actually more diverse than the city it emulates, noting that Seattle is actually 70% Caucasian.[10]\\r\\nThe nine characters who appear as series regulars in the first season all work in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. Five of the characters are interns: Meredith Grey portrayed by Ellen Pompeo, who is in a romantic relationship with her attending Derek Shepherd, and is the daughter of the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, who now suffers from Alzheimer's; Cristina Yang portrayed by Sandra Oh, an extremely competitive intern who befriends Meredith and begins a sexual relationship with Preston Burke; Izzie Stevens portrayed by Katherine Heigl, an ex model who struggles to be recognized as a doctor; Alex Karev portrayed by Justin Chambers, an arrogant intern who initially irritates his colleagues, and George O'Malley portrayed by T.R. Knight, an insecure intern with a lack of confidence, who develops a crush on Meredith. The interns are mentored by their resident Miranda Bailey portrayed by Chandra Wilson, a disciplined woman who is nicknamed \\"The Nazi\\". The surgical program is led by the Chief of Surgery Dr. Richard Webber portrayed by James Pickens Jr.. In his employ are Preston Burke and Derek Shepherd from New York portrayed by Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey respectively.[11] Guest stars include Meredith's mother Ellis, portrayed by Kate Burton, nurse Olivia Harper, portrayed by Sarah Utterback, who serves as a love interest for George and Alex, and Derek's estranged wife Addison Montgomery, played by Kate Walsh.\\r\\nThe first season's ratings were consistently high, ranking first in its timeslot and leading its closest competition by 7.2 million viewers. It delivered ABC's best audience retention following Desperate Housewives, was the highest rated show amongst 18- to 49-year-olds in 13 years since The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, and produced ABC's strongest series performance in the hour in more than four years.[12] Commenting on the first season's high ratings, Magna Global USA media analyst Steve Sternberg stated: \\"Roughly 80 percent of households during prime time only have one TV set on. People are looking for shows they can watch with other household members. And just as Desperate Housewives reaches a broad audience - younger, older, male, female - so does Grey's Anatomy.\\"[5] The season finale was watched by 22.22 million viewers,[13] and was ranked the ninth in viewership.\\r\\nThe first season of Grey's received mostly positive reviews from the critics. In regard to the first season, New York Daily News named Grey's Anatomy a \\"winner\\",[14] whereas Newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating \\"You simply can't stop watching.\\"[14] Walter Chaw from Film Freak Central said the show was \\"so odious, so repugnant, that it's impossible not to have predicted its newly-minted role as the most popular program in the land.\\"[15] The Washington Post's Tom Shales was critical of the early series, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: \\"The show is much more a matter of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different\\". He called Rhimes' script for the pilot episode \\"nothing but a casserole made of equal parts ham and corn\\", writing that overall: \\"It's a 'new' show only in the sense that Dr. Frankenstein's monster was a new man.\\"[16] Kate Aurthur for The New York Times deemed the show a hybrid of Ally McBeal, Sex and the City and ER, writing of the news that it had become the highest-rated midseason drama in 12 years that: \\"When you parse its ratings, Grey's Anatomy underscores one of the real lessons of the current season - men will watch shows with a female lead. That goes against conventional wisdom, which dictates that it's easier to get women to watch shows aimed at men.\\"[17] Review Stream gave positive reviews regarding the pilot episode, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", due to the undeniable chemistry between Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey from the series' first scene.[18] Regarding Miranda Bailey's appearance in the pilot, ReviewStream.com stated \\"She's such a small woman but wait until she speaks\\".[18] HomeTheaterInfo.com, however, had a mixed perspectives on the pilot, noting that the storylines were similar to fellow ABC series Desperate Housewives, but also \\"brilliantly written, extremely well acted and directed to near perfection\\".[19] IGN gave a positive review stating, \\"The show isn't derivative, and actually maintains a tenuous edge over its predecessor, the characters resemble real people - who are fragile, and yes, fallible.\\" and added, \\"this facile description does little justice to the show's tightly-wound plotting, character subtleties, or masterful acting, it speaks to the intangible nature of what differentiates the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, in network television.\\"[20]\\r\\nSandra Oh won Best Supporting Actress ÿ Series, Miniseries or Television Film at the 63rd Golden Globe Awards[9] and Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series at the 12th Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2005,[21] for her portrayal of Cristina Yang during Grey's Anatomy's first season.

Chichester in the southwest is the county town and only city in West Sussex, with the largest towns being Crawley, Worthing and Horsham.\\r\\nWest Sussex has a range of scenery, including wealden, downland and coastal. The highest point of the county is Blackdown, at 280 metres (919?ft). It has a number of stately homes including Goodwood, Petworth House and Uppark and also castles such as Arundel Castle and Bramber Castle. Over half the county is protected countryside, offering walking, cycling and other recreational opportunities.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the name Sussex, derived from the Old English 'Stsaxe' ('South Saxons'), is from the Saxon period between AD 477 to 1066, the history of human habitation in Sussex goes back to the Old Stone Age.[2] The oldest hominin remains known in Britain were found at Eartham Pit, Boxgrove.[3][4] Sussex has been occupied since those times and has succumbed to various invasions and migrations throughout its long history.[2] Prehistoric monuments include the Devil's Jumps, a group of Bronze Age burial mounds, and the Iron Age Cissbury Ring and Chanctonbury Ring hill forts on the South Downs.\\r\\nThe Roman period saw the building of Fishbourne Roman Palace and rural villas such as Bignor Roman Villa together with a network of roads including Stane Street, the Chichester to Silchester Way and the Sussex Greensand Way. The Romans used the Weald for iron production on an industrial scale.[5]\\r\\nThe foundation of the Kingdom of Sussex is recorded by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year AD 477; it says that ?lle arrived at a place called Cymenshore in three ships with his three sons and killed or put to flight the local inhabitants. The foundation story is regarded as somewhat of a myth by most historians, although the archaeology suggests that Saxons did start to settle in the area in the late 5th century.[6][7] The Kingdom of Sussex was absorbed into Wessex as an earldom and became the county of Sussex.\\r\\nWith its origins in the kingdom of Sussex, the later county of Sussex was traditionally divided into six units known as rapes. By the 16th century, the three western rapes were grouped together informally, having their own separate Quarter Sessions. These were administered by a separate county council from 1888, the county of Sussex being divided for administrative purposes into the administrative counties of East and West Sussex. In 1974, West Sussex was made a single ceremonial county with the coming into force of the Local Government Act 1972. At the same time a large part of the eastern rape of Lewes (the Mid Sussex district which includes the towns of Haywards Heath, Burgess Hill and East Grinstead) was transferred into West Sussex.\\r\\nUntil 1834 provision for the poor and destitute in West Sussex was made at parish level. From 1835 until 1948 eleven Poor Law Unions, each catering for several parishes, took on the job.[8]\\r\\nMost settlements in West Sussex are either along the south coast or in Mid Sussex, near the M23/A23 corridor. The town of Crawley is the largest in the county with an estimated population of 106,600.[9] The coastal settlement of Worthing closely follows with a population of 104,600.[9] The seaside resort of Bognor Regis and market town Horsham are both large towns. Chichester, the county town, has a cathedral and city status, and is situated not far from the border with Hampshire. Other conurbations of a similar size are Burgess Hill, East Grinstead and Haywards Heath in the Mid Sussex district, Littlehampton in the Arun district, and Lancing, Southwick and Shoreham in the Adur district. Much of the coastal town population is part of the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation.\\r\\nRustington and Southwater are the next largest settlements in the county. There are several more towns in West Sussex, although they are of similar size to other villages. The smaller towns of the county are Arundel, Midhurst, Petworth, Selsey and Steyning. The larger villages are Billingshurst, Copthorne, Crawley Down, Cuckfield, Henfield, Hassocks, Hurstpierpoint, Lindfield, Pulborough and Storrington. The current total population of the county makes up 1.53% of England's population.\\r\\nWest Sussex is bordered by Hampshire to the west, Surrey to the north and East Sussex to the east. The English Channel lies to the south. The area has been formed from Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rock strata, part of the WealdÿArtois Anticline. The eastern part of this ridge, the Weald of Kent, Sussex and Surrey has been greatly eroded, with the chalk surface removed to expose older Lower Cretaceous rocks of the Wealden Group.[10] In West Sussex the exposed rock becomes older towards the north of the county with Lower Greensand ridges along the border with Surrey including the highest point of the county at Blackdown. Erosion of softer sand and clay strata has hollowed out the basin of the Weald leaving a north facing scarp slope of the chalk which runs east and west across the whole county, broken only by the valleys of the River Arun and River Adur.[11] In addition to these two rivers which drain most of the county a winterbourne, the River Lavant, flows intermittently from springs on the dip slope of the chalk downs north of Chichester.[12]\\r\\nThe county makes up 1.52% of the total land of England, making it the 30th largest county in the country.[13]\\r\\nWest Sussex is officially the sunniest county in the United Kingdom according to Met Office records over 29 years with an average 1902 hours per year.[15] Sunshine totals are highest near the coast with Bognor Regis often having the highest in mainland England, including a total of 2237 hours in 1990. Mean annual temperature for southern coastal counties is around 11?C. The coldest month, January, has mean daily minimum temperatures of around 3?C near the coast and lower inland. July tends to be the warmest month when mean daily maxima tend to be around 20?C. A maximum temperature of 35.4?C occurred at North Heath, Pulborough on 26 June 1976. Coastal high temperatures are often moderated by cooler sea breezes.[16]\\r\\nMonthly rainfall tends to be highest in autumn and early winter and lowest in the summer months, with July often being the driest month. There is less rainfall from summer convective showers and thunderstorms than in inland areas. The county can suffer both from localised flooding caused by heavy rainfall and from water shortages caused by prolonged periods of below average rainfall. Winter rainfall is needed to recharge the chalk aquifers from which much of the water supply is drawn.[16]\\r\\nWest Sussex developed distinctive land uses along with its neighbours in the weald. The Landrace cattle transformed into Sussex cattle and Sussex chickens emerged about the time of the Roman conquest.[17] Some of the earliest evidence of horses in Britain has been found at Boxgrove, dated to 500,000 BC. Viticulture is a part of the economy, with wineries producing mainly sparkling wine of varied quality.[18]\\r\\nThe M23 Motorway runs from London to the south of Crawley. The A23 and A24 roads run from London to Brighton and Worthing respectively with the A29 a little further west ending in Bognor Regis. Other major roads are the A272 which runs east to west through the middle of the county and the A27 which does the same but closer to the coast. The A259 is a local alternate route to the A27 in the eastern coastal strip.\\r\\nGatwick Airport, which handled over 33 million passengers and had over 250,000 aircraft movements in 2011, is located within the borders of Crawley, and is the second largest airport in the United Kingdom. There is also a considerably smaller local airport at Shoreham and a grass airfield handling light aircraft and helicopters at Goodwood. There are three main railway routes: the Brighton Main Line, the Arun Valley Line and the West Coastway Line. The Portsmouth Direct Line serves and occasionally enters the westernmost part of West Sussex, although it has no railway stations in the county.\\r\\nSince the 2015 general election, West Sussex has been represented entirely by Conservative MPs.\\r\\n[19]\\r\\nWest Sussex County Council (WSCC) is the authority that governs the non-metropolitan county of West Sussex. The county contains 7 district and borough councils ( Adur, Arun, Chichester, Crawley, Horsham, Mid Sussex and Worthing), and 159 town, parish and neighbourhood councils.\\r\\nWest Sussex County Council has 71 councillors; the majority of them being Conservative. There are 46 Conservative councillors, 10 UK Independence Party, 8 Liberal Democrats, 6 Labour Party councillors and 1 Independent councillor.[20] The Chief Executive and his team of Executive Directors are responsible for the day-to-day running of the council.\\r\\nWest Sussex County Council is based at County Hall, Chichester and provides a large range of services including education, social services, fire and rescue, libraries, trading standards, town and country planning, refuse disposal and consumer services.\\r\\nThe West Sussex Youth Cabinet is a group of local representatives and four UK Youth Parliament (UKYP) representatives, who are elected by young people in West Sussex.[21] The Youth Cabinet represents the views of the young people West Sussex at county level. Elections for the Youth Cabinet and UKYP in West Sussex run every year in March.\\r\\nThe Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity, otherwise called Chichester Cathedral, is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Chichester. It was founded as a cathedral in 1075, when the seat of the bishop was moved from Selsey Abbey.[23] The cathedral has architecture in both the Norman and the Gothic styles, and has been called by the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner \\"the most typical English Cathedral\\".[24] The Cathedral Church of Our Lady and St Philip Howard in Arundel is the Roman Catholic cathedral of the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton. Built in French Gothic style and dedicated in 1873 as the Catholic parish church of Arundel, it was not designated a cathedral until the foundation of the diocese in 1965.[25]\\r\\nBosham Church is partly of Saxon construction and is shown on the Bayeaux Tapestry as the local church of late Saxon and Danish kings of England.[26] Many other Saxon and early Norman have survived in the county with little alteration including the Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting, an 11th-century Anglo-Saxon church with a Rhenish helm unique in England and St. Nicholas' Church, Worth, a 10th-century church in Worth, Crawley. Some Anglican churches and many of the numerous nonconformist chapels in the county have been converted to residential use. Cittaviveka is a Buddhist monastery in Chithurst.\\r\\nPallant House Gallery in Chichester houses one of the most significant collections of 20th-century British art outside London. It includes a substantial body of early and mid-20th-century work bequeathed by Walter Hussey and many later works donated by Sir Colin St John 'Sandy' Wilson.\\r\\nWorthing Museum and Art Gallery houses a large collection of Georgian and Victorian costume. The Cass Sculpture Foundation has an outdoor sculpture park at Goodwood.\\r\\nThis is a table of trend of regional gross value added of West Sussex at current basic prices published by Office for National Statistics with figures in millions of British Pounds Sterling.[30]\\r\\nSignificant companies in the county include Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a substantial employer near Chichester. Gatwick Airport, with associated airlines including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, is a major source of direct and indirect employment. Thales Group also has a presence in the county.\\r\\nThe table below shows the population change up to the 2011 census, contrasting the previous census. It also shows the proportion of residents in each district reliant upon lowest income and/or joblessness benefits, the national average proportion of which was 4.5% as at August 2012, the year for which latest datasets have been published. It can be seen that the most populous district of West Sussex is Arun containing the towns of Arundel, Bognor Regis and Littlehampton:\\r\\nWest Sussex has a comprehensive education system, with a mix of county-maintained secondary schools and academies and over twenty independent senior schools. In addition primary education is provided through a mix of around 240 infant, junior, primary, first and middle schools.\\r\\nColleges include The College of Richard Collyer, Central Sussex College, Northbrook College and The Weald School.\\r\\nIndependent schools in the county include Christ's Hospital, whose students wear Tudor style uniform, Seaford College, Lancing College and Hurstpierpoint College.\\r\\nTertiary education is provided by the University of Chichester and Chichester College.\\r\\nAt least 40 sports are active in West Sussex.

They belong to the tanager family and are not closely related to the true finches. The closest known relative of the Galpagos finches is Tiaris obscurus.[6] They were first collected by Charles Darwin on the Galpagos Islands during the second voyage of the Beagle. Apart from the Cocos finch, which is from Cocos Island, the others are found only on the Galpagos Islands.\\r\\nThe term \\"Darwin's finches\\" was first applied by Percy Lowe in 1936, and popularised in 1947 by David Lack in his book Darwin's Finches.[7][8] David Lack based his analysis on the large collection of museum specimens collected by the 1905ÿ06 Galpagos expedition of the California Academy of Sciences, to whom Lack dedicated his 1947 book. The birds vary in size from 10 to 20?cm and weigh between 8 and 38?grams. The smallest are the warbler-finches and the largest is the vegetarian finch. The most important differences between species are in the size and shape of their beaks, which are highly adapted to different food sources. The birds are all dull-coloured.\\r\\nA long-term study carried out for more than 40 years by the Princeton University researchers Peter and Rosemary Grant has documented micro-evolutionary changes in beak size affected by El Nino/La Nina cycles in the Pacific.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the survey voyage of HMS Beagle, Darwin was unaware of the significance of the birds of the Galpagos. He had learned how to preserve bird specimens while at the University of Edinburgh and had been keen on shooting, but he had no expertise in ornithology and by this stage of the voyage concentrated mainly on geology.[10] In Galpagos he mostly left bird shooting to his servant Syms Covington.[11] Nonetheless, these birds were to play an important part in the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.\\r\\nOn the Galpagos Islands and afterward, Darwin thought in terms of \\"centres of creation\\" and rejected ideas concerning the transmutation of species.[12] From Henslow's teaching, he was interested in the geographical distribution of species, particularly links between species on oceanic islands and on nearby continents. On Chatham Island, he recorded that a mockingbird was similar to those he had seen in Chile, and after finding a different one on Charles Island he carefully noted where mockingbirds had been caught.[10] In contrast, he paid little attention to the finches. When examining his specimens on the way to Tahiti, Darwin noted that all of the mockingbirds on Charles Island were of one species, those from Albemarle of another, and those from James and Chatham Islands of a third. As they sailed home about nine months later, this, together with other facts, including what he had heard about Galpagos tortoises, made him wonder about the stability of species.[13][14]\\r\\nFollowing his return from the voyage, Darwin presented the finches to the Zoological Society of London on 4 January 1837, along with other mammal and bird specimens that he had collected. The bird specimens, including the finches, were given to John Gould, the famous English ornithologist, for identification. Gould set aside his paying work and at the next meeting, on 10 January, reported that the birds from the Galpagos Islands that Darwin had thought were blackbirds, \\"gross-beaks\\" and finches were actually \\"a series of ground Finches which are so peculiar [as to form] an entirely new group, containing 12 species\\". This story made the newspapers.[15][16]\\r\\nDarwin had been in Cambridge at that time. In early March, he met Gould again and for the first time got a full report on the findings, including the point that his Galpagos \\"wren\\" was another closely allied species of finch. The mockingbirds that Darwin had labelled by island were separate species rather than just varieties. Gould found more species than Darwin had expected,[17] and concluded that 25 of the 26 land birds were new and distinct forms, found nowhere else in the world but closely allied to those found on the South American continent.[16] Darwin now saw that, if the finch species were confined to individual islands, like the mockingbirds, this would help to account for the number of species on the islands, and he sought information from others on the expedition. Specimens had also been collected by Captain Robert FitzRoy, FitzRoys steward Harry Fuller and Darwin's servant Covington, who had labelled them by island.[18] From these, Darwin tried to reconstruct the locations from where he had collected his own specimens. The conclusions supported his idea of the transmutation of species.[16]\\r\\nAt the time that he rewrote his diary for publication as Journal and Remarks (later The Voyage of the Beagle), he described Gould's findings on the number of birds, noting that \\"Although the species are thus peculiar to the archipelago, yet nearly all in their general structure, habits, colour of feathers, and even tone of voice, are strictly American\\".[19] In the first edition of The Voyage of the Beagle, Darwin said that \\"It is very remarkable that a nearly perfect gradation of structure in this one group can be traced in the form of the beak, from one exceeding in dimensions that of the largest gros-beak, to another differing but little from that of a warbler\\".[20]\\r\\nBy the time the first edition was published, the development of Darwin's theory of natural selection was in progress. For the 1845 second edition of The Voyage (now titled Journal of Researches), Darwin added more detail about the beaks of the birds, and two closing sentences which reflected his changed ideas: \\"Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.\\"[21][22]\\r\\nThe remaining land-birds form a most singular group of finches, related to each other in the structure of their beaks, short tails, form of body and plumage: there are thirteen species, which Mr. Gould has divided into four subgroups. All these species are peculiar to this archipelago; and so is the whole group, with the exception of one species of the sub-group Cactornis, lately brought from Bow Island, in the Low Archipelago. Of Cactornis, the two species may be often seen climbing about the flowers of the great cactus-trees; but all the other species of this group of finches, mingled together in flocks, feed on the dry and sterile ground of the lower districts. The males of all, or certainly of the greater number, are jet black; and the females (with perhaps one or two exceptions) are brown. The most curious fact is the perfect gradation in the size of the beaks in the different species of Geospiza, from one as large as that of a hawfinch to that of a chaffinch, and (if Mr. Gould is right in including his sub-group, Certhidea, in the main group) even to that of a warbler. The largest beak in the genus Geospiza is shown in Fig. 1, and the smallest in Fig. 3; but instead of there being only one intermediate species, with a beak of the size shown in Fig. 2, there are no less than six species with insensibly graduated beaks. The beak of the sub-group Certhidea, is shown in Fig. 4. The beak of Cactornis is somewhat like that of a starling, and that of the fourth subgroup, Camarhynchus, is slightly parrot-shaped. Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends. In a like manner it might be fancied that a bird originally a buzzard, had been induced here to undertake the office of the carrion-feeding Polybori of the American continent.[23]\\r\\nDarwin discussed the divergence of species of birds in the Galpagos more explicitly in his chapter on geographical distribution in On the Origin of Species:\\r\\nThe most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands, is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the same species. [In] the Galapagos Archipelago... almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakable stamp of the American continent. There are twenty-six land birds, and twenty-five of these are ranked by Mr. Gould as distinct species, supposed to have been created here; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to American species in every character, in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice, was manifest.... The naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the Pacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent, yet feels that he is standing on American land. Why should this be so? why should the species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated together, which resembles closely the conditions of the South American coast: in fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. On the other hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil, in climate, height, and size of the islands, between the Galapagos and Cape de Verde Archipelagos: but what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! The inhabitants of the Cape de Verde Islands are related to those of Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America. I believe this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas on the view here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive colonists, whether by occasional means of transport or by formerly continuous land, from America; and the Cape de Verde Islands from Africa; and that such colonists would be liable to modification;the principle of inheritance still betraying their original birthplace.[24]\\r\\nWhereas Darwin spent just five weeks in the Galpagos, and David Lack spent three months, Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have made research trips to the Galpagos for about thirty years, particularly studying Darwin's finches. Here, we look briefly at the case of the large cactus finch Geospiza conirostris on Isla Genovesa (formerly Tower Island), which is formed from a shield volcano, and is home to a variety of birds. These birds, like all well-studied groups,[25] show various kinds of morphism.\\r\\nMales are dimorphic in song type: songs A and B are quite distinct. Also, males with song A have shorter bills than B males. This is also a clear difference. With these beaks, males are able to feed differently on their favourite cactus, the prickly pear Opuntia. Those with long beaks are able to punch holes in the cactus fruit and eat the fleshy aril pulp, which surrounds the seeds, whereas those with shorter beaks tear apart the cactus base and eat the pulp and any insect larvae and pupae (both groups eat flowers and buds). This dimorphism clearly maximises their feeding opportunities during the non-breeding season when food is scarce.\\r\\nIf the population is panmixic,[26][27] then Geospiza conirostris exhibits a balanced genetic polymorphism and not, as originally supposed, a case of nascent sympatric speciation. The selection maintaining the polymorphism maximises the species' niche by expanding its feeding opportunity. The genetics of this situation cannot be clarified in the absence of a detailed breeding program, but two loci with linkage disequilibrium[28] is a possibility.\\r\\nAnother interesting dimorphism is for the bills of young finches, which are either 'pink' or 'yellow'. All species of Darwin's finches exhibit this morphism, which lasts for two months. No interpretation of this phenomenon is known.[29]\\r\\nFor some decades, taxonomists have placed these birds in the family Emberizidae along with the New World sparrows and Old World buntings (Sulloway 1982). However, the SibleyÿAhlquist taxonomy puts Darwin's finches with the tanagers (Monroe and Sibley 1993), and at least one recent work follows that example (Burns and Skutch 2003). The American Ornithologists' Union, in its North American check-list, places the Cocos finch in the Emberizidae but with an asterisk indicating that the placement is probably wrong (AOU 1998ÿ2006); in its tentative South American check-list, the Galpagos species are incertae sedis, of uncertain place (Remsen et al. 2007).\\r\\nDevelopmental research in 2004 found that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), and its differential expression during development, resulted in variation of beak size and shape among finches. BMP4 acts in the developing embryo to lay down skeletal features, including the beak.[30] The same group showed that the development of the different beak shapes in Darwin's finches are also influenced by slightly different timing and spatial expressions of a gene called calmodulin (CaM).[31] Calmodulin acts in a similar way to BMP4, affecting some of the features of beak growth. The authors suggest that changes in the temporal and spatial expression of these two factors are possible developmental controls of beak morphology. In a recent study genome sequencing revealed a 240 kilobase haplotype encompassing the ALX1 gene that encodes a transcription factor affecting craniofacial development is strongly associated with beak shape diversity.[32][33] Moreover, these changes in the beak size have also altered vocalization in Darwin's finches.[5]","input":"How many types of finch species are there?"},{"output":"Nevada-class battleship","context":"USS Oklahoma (BB-37) was a Nevada-class battleship built by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation for the United States Navy in 1910, notable for being the first American class of oil-burning dreadnoughts.\\r\\nCommissioned in 1916, Oklahoma served in World War I as a part of Battleship Division 6, protecting Allied convoys on their way across the Atlantic. After the war, she served in both the United States Battle Fleet and Scouting Fleet. Oklahoma was modernized between 1927 and 1929. In 1936, she rescued American citizens and refugees from the Spanish Civil War. On returning to the West Coast in August of the same year, Oklahoma spent the rest of her service in the Pacific.\\r\\nOn 7 December 1941, Oklahoma was sunk by several torpedoes during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Torpedoes from torpedo bomber airplanes hit the Oklahoma's hull and the ship capsized. Survivors jumped off the ship 50 feet (15?m) into burning hot water or crawled across mooring lines that connected Oklahoma and Maryland. Some sailors inside escaped when rescuers drilled holes and opened hatches to rescue them. A total of 429 crew died when she capsized and sank in Battleship Row. In 1943, Oklahoma was righted and salvaged. Unlike most of the other battleships that were recovered following Pearl Harbor, Oklahoma was too damaged to return to duty. Her wreck was eventually stripped of her remaining armament and superstructure before being sold for scrap in 1946. The hulk sank in a storm in 1947, while being towed from Oahu, Hawaii, to a breakers yard in San Francisco Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOklahoma was the second of two Nevada-class battleships. Both were ordered in a naval appropriation act on 4 March 1911. She was the latest in a series of 22 battleships and seven armored cruisers ordered by the United States Navy between 1900 and 1911.[5] The Nevada class were the first of the US Navy's Standard type battleships, of which 12 were completed by 1923. With these ships, the Navy created a fleet of modern battleships similar in long-range gunnery, speed, turning radius, and protection. Significant improvements, however, were made in the Standard type ships as naval technology progressed. The main innovations were triple turrets and all-or-nothing protection. The triple turrets reduced the length of the ship that needed protection by placing 10 guns in four turrets instead of five, thus allowing thicker armor.[6][7] The Nevadas were also the first US battleships with oil-fired instead of coal-fired boilers, oil having more recoverable energy per ton than coal, thus increasing the ships' range. Oklahoma differed from her sister Nevada in being fitted with triple-expansion steam engines, a much older technology than Nevada's new geared turbines.[8]\\r\\nAs constructed, she had a standard displacement of 27,500 long tons (27,941?t) and a full-load displacement of 28,400 long tons (28,856?t). She was 583 feet (178?m) in length overall, 575 feet (175?m) at the waterline, and had a beam of 95?feet 6?inches (29.11?m) and a draft of 28?feet 6?inches (8.69?m).[2]\\r\\nShe was powered by 12 oil-fired Babcock & Wilcox boilers driving two dual-acting, vertical triple-expansion reciprocating steam engines, with 24,800?ihp (18,500?kW), with a maximum speed of 20.5 knots (38.0?km/h; 23.6?mph). She had a designed range of 8,000 nautical miles (15,000?km; 9,200?mi) at 10 knots (19?km/h; 12?mph).[2]\\r\\nAs built armor on Oklahoma consisted of belt armor from 13.5 to 8 inches (343 to 203?mm) thick. Deck armor was 3 inches (76?mm) thick with a second 1.5 inches (38?mm) deck, and turret armor was 18 inches (457?mm) or 16?in (406?mm) on the face, 5 inches (127?mm) on the top, 10 inches (254?mm) on the sides, and 9 inches (229?mm) on the rear. Armor on her barbettes was 13.5?inches. Her conning tower was protected by 16?inches of armor, with 8?inches of armor on its roof.[2]\\r\\nHer armament consisted of ten 14-inch (356?mm)/45 caliber guns, arranged in two triple and two twin mounts. As built, she also carried 21 5-inch (127?mm)/51 caliber guns, primarily for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats. She also had two (some references say four) 21-inch (533?mm) torpedo tubes for the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo. Her crew consisted of 864 officers and enlisted men.[2]\\r\\nOklahoma's keel was laid down on 26 October 1912, by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey, who bid $5,926,000 to construct the ship.[9] By 12 December 1912, she was 11.2 percent complete, and by 13 July 1913, she was at 33 percent.[10] She was launched on 23 March 1914, sponsored by Lorena J. Cruce, daughter of Oklahoma Governor Lee Cruce. The launch was preceded by an invocation, the first for an American warship in half a century, given by Elijah Embree Hoss, and was attended by various dignitaries from Oklahoma and the federal government. She was subsequently moved to a dock near the new Argentine battleship Moreno and Chinese cruiser Fei Hung, soon to be the Greek Elli, for fitting-out.[11]\\r\\nOn the night of 19 July 1915, large fires were discovered underneath the fore main battery turret, the third to flare up on an American battleship in less than a month.[12][a] However, by 22 July, the Navy believed that the Oklahoma fire had been caused by \\"defective insulation\\" or a mistake made by a dockyard worker.[13] The fire delayed the battleship's completion so much that Nevada was able to conduct her sea trials and be commissioned before Oklahoma.[14] On 23 October 1915, she was 98.1 percent complete.[15] She was commissioned at Philadelphia, on 2 May 1916, with Captain Roger Welles in command.[16]\\r\\nFollowing commissioning, the ship remained along the East Coast of the United States, primarily visiting various Navy yards. At first, she was unable to join the Battleship Division Nine task force sent to support the Grand Fleet in the North Sea during World War I because oil was unavailable there. In 1917, she underwent a refit, with two 3?in (76?mm)/50 caliber guns being installed forward of the mainmast for anti-aircraft defense and nine of the 5-inch/51 caliber guns being removed or repositioned.[17] While conditions on the ship were cramped, the sailors on the ship had many advantages for education available to them.[18] They also engaged in athletic competitions, including boxing, wrestling, and rowing competitions with the crews of the battleship Texas and the tug Ontario. The camaraderie built from these small competitions led to fleet-wide establishment of many athletic teams pitting crews against one another for morale by the 1930s.[19]\\r\\nOn 13 August 1918,[20] Oklahoma was assigned to Battleship Division Six under the command of Rear Admiral Thomas S. Rodgers, and departed for Europe alongside Nevada. On 23 August, they rendezvoused with destroyers Balch, Conyngham, Downes, Kimberly, Allen, and Sampson, 275 miles (443?km) west of Ireland, before steaming for Berehaven Harbor, where they waited for 18 days before battleship Utah arrived. The division remained at anchor, tasked to protect American convoys coming into the area, but was only called out of the harbor once in 80 days. On 14 October 1918, while under command of Charles B. McVay, Jr., she escorted troop ships into port at the United Kingdom, returning on 16 October. For the rest of the time, the ship conducted drills at anchor or in nearby Bantry Bay. To pass the time, the crews played American football, and competitive sailing. Oklahoma suffered six casualties between 21 October and 2 November to the 1918 flu pandemic.[21] Oklahoma remained off Berehaven until the end of the war on 11 November 1918. Shortly thereafter, several Oklahoma crewmembers were involved in a series of fights with members of the Sinn Fin group, forcing the ship's commander to apologize and financially compensate two town mayors.[22]\\r\\nOklahoma left for Portland on 26 November, joined there by Arizona on 30 November, Nevada on 4 December, and Battleship Division Nine's ships shortly after. The ships were assigned as a convoy escort for the ocean liner SS?George Washington, carrying President Woodrow Wilson, and arrived with that ship in France several days later. She departed December 14, for New York City, and then spent early 1919 conducting winter battle drills off the coast of Cuba. On 15 June 1919, she returned to Brest, escorting Wilson on a second trip, and returned to New York, on 8 July.[23] A part of the Atlantic Fleet for the next two years, Oklahoma was overhauled and her crew trained. The secondary battery was reduced from 20 to 12 5-inch/51 caliber guns in 1918.[24] Early in 1921, she voyaged to South America's West Coast for combined exercises with the Pacific Fleet, and returned later that year for the Peruvian Centennial.[20]\\r\\nShe then joined the Pacific Fleet and, in 1925, began a high-profile training cruise with several other battleships. They left San Francisco on 15 April 1925, arrived in Hawaii, on 27 April, where they conducted war games. They left for Samoa, on 1 July, crossing the equator on 6 July. On 27 July, they arrived in Australia and conducted a number of exercises there, before spending time in New Zealand, returning to the United States later that year. In early 1927, she transited the Panama Canal and moved to join the Scouting Fleet.[25] In November 1927, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for an extensive overhaul. She was modernized by adding eight 5-inch/25 cal guns,[24] and her turrets' maximum elevation was raised from 15 to 30 degrees. An aircraft catapult was installed atop turret No.3. She was also substantially up-armored between September 1927 and July 1929, where anti-torpedo bulges were added, as well as an additional 2 inches (51?mm) of steel on her armor deck. The overhaul increased her beam to 108 feet (33?m), the widest in the US Navy, and reduced her speed to 19.68 knots (36.45?km/h; 22.65?mph).[26]\\r\\nOklahoma rejoined the Scouting Fleet for exercises in the Caribbean, then returned to the West Coast in June 1930, for fleet operations through spring 1936. That summer, she carried midshipmen on a European training cruise, visiting northern ports. The cruise was interrupted by the outbreak of civil war in Spain, as Oklahoma sailed to Bilbao, arriving on 24 July 1936, to rescue American citizens and other refugees whom she carried to Gibraltar and French ports. She returned to Norfolk on 11 September, and to the West Coast on 24 October.[1]\\r\\nThe Pacific Fleet operations of Oklahoma during the next four years included joint operations with the Army and the training of reservists. Oklahoma was based at Pearl Harbor from 29 December 1937, for patrols and exercises, and only twice returned to the mainland, once to have anti-aircraft guns and armor added to her superstructure at Puget Sound Navy Yard in early February 1941, and once to have armor replaced at San Pedro in mid-August of the same year. En route on 22 August, a severe storm hit Oklahoma, and one man was swept overboard along with three men injured.[27] The next morning, a broken starboard propeller shaft forced the ship to halt, assess the damage, and sail to San Francisco, the closest navy yard with an adequate drydock.[28] She remained in drydock until mid-October. The ship then returned to Hawaii.[29]\\r\\nThe Washington Naval Treaty had precluded the Navy from replacing Oklahoma, leading to the series of refits to extend its lifespan. But the ship was planned to be retired on 2 May 1942.[30]\\r\\nOklahoma was moored in berth Fox 5, in Battleship Row, on 7 December 1941, when the Japanese attacked,[31] berthed outboard alongside Maryland.[32] She was almost immediately targeted by aircraft from Akagi and Kaga, striking her with three torpedoes. The first and second hit seconds apart, striking amidships at approximately 07:56, 20 feet (6.1?m) below the waterline between the smokestack and mainmast. They blew away a big section of her anti-torpedo bulge and spilled oil from the adjacent fuel bunkers' sounding tubes, but neither penetrated the hull. About 80 men scrambled to man the AA guns on deck, but were unable to use them because the firing locks were in the armory. Most of the men manned battle stations below the ship's waterline or sought shelter in the third deck, protocol during an aerial attack. The third torpedo struck at 08:00, near Frame 65, hitting close to where the first two did, penetrating the hull, destroying the adjacent fuel bunkers on the second platform deck and rupturing access trunks to the two forward boiler rooms as well as the transverse bulkhead to the aft boiler room and the longitudinal bulkhead of the two forward firing rooms.[33]\\r\\nAs she began to capsize to port, two more torpedoes struck, and her men were strafed as they abandoned ship.[34] In less than twelve minutes, she rolled over until halted by her masts touching bottom, her starboard side above water, and a part of her keel exposed. It's believed the ship absorbed as many as eight hits in all.[35]\\r\\nMany of her crew, however, remained in the fight, clambering aboard Maryland to help serve her anti-aircraft batteries.[36] Four hundred twenty-nine of her officers and enlisted men were killed or missing. One of those killed, Father Aloysius Schmitt, was the first American chaplain of any faith to die in World War II. Thirty-two others were wounded, and many were trapped within the capsized hull. Efforts to rescue them began within minutes of the ship's capsizing and continued into the night, in several cases rescuing men trapped inside the ship for hours. Julio DeCastro, a Hawaiian civilian yard worker, organized a team that saved 32 Oklahoma sailors.[37]\\r\\nSome of those who died later had ships named after them, including Ensign John C. England for whom USS?England?(DE-635) and USS?England?(DLG-22) are named. USS?Austin was named for Chief Carpenter John Arnold Austin, who was also posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his actions during the attack. In addition to Austin's Navy Cross, the Medal of Honor was awarded to Ensign Francis C. Flaherty and Seaman James R. Ward, while three Navy and Marine Corps Medals were awarded to others on Oklahoma during the attack.[38]\\r\\nBy early 1942, it was determined that Oklahoma could be salvaged, but that it was cost-prohibitive to do so, and that she was a navigational hazard having rolled into the harbor's navigational channel. The job of salvaging Oklahoma commenced on 15 July 1942, under the immediate command of Captain F. H. Whitaker, and a team from the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard.[39]\\r\\nPreparations for righting the overturned hull took under eight months to complete. Air was pumped into interior chambers and improvised airlocks built into the ship, forcing 20,000 tonnes (19,684 long tons; 22,046 short tons) of water out of the ship through the torpedo holes. Four thousand five hundred tonnes (4,429 long tons; 4,960 short tons) of coral soil were deposited in front of her bow to prevent sliding and two barges were posted on either end of the ship to control the ship's rising.[40]\\r\\nTwenty-one derricks were attached to the upturned hull; each carried high-tensile steel cables that were connected to hydraulic winching machines ashore. The righting (parbuckling) operation began on 8 March, and was completed by 16 June 1943. Teams of naval specialists then entered the previously submerged ship to remove any additional human remains. Cofferdams were then placed around the hull to allow basic repairs to be undertaken so that the ship could be refloated; this work was completed by November. On 28 December, Oklahoma was towed into drydock No. 2, at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Once in the dock, her main guns, machinery, remaining ammunition, and stores were removed. The severest structural damage on the hull was also repaired to make the ship watertight.[41][42]\\r\\nOklahoma was decommissioned on 1 September 1944, and all remaining armaments and superstructure were then removed. She was then put up for auction at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 26 November 1946, with her engines, boilers, turbo generators, steering units and about 24,000 tonnes (23,621 long tons; 26,455 short tons) of structural steel deemed salvageable. She was sold to Moore Drydock Co. of Oakland, California for $46,127.[43][44]\\r\\nIn May 1947, a two-tug towing operation began to move the hull of Oklahoma from Pearl Harbor to the scrapyard in San Francisco Bay. Disaster struck on 17 May, when the ships entered a storm more than 500 miles (800?km) from Hawaii. The tug Hercules put her searchlight on the former battleship, revealing that she had begun listing heavily. After radioing the naval base at Pearl Harbor, both tugs were instructed to turn around and head back to port. Without warning, Hercules was pulled back past Monarch, which was being dragged backwards at 15 knots (28?km/h; 17?mph).[45] Oklahoma had begun to sink straight down, causing water to swamp the sterns of both tugs.[46]\\r\\nBoth tug skippers had fortunately loosened their cable drums connecting the 1,400-foot (430?m) tow lines to Oklahoma.[46] As the battleship sank rapidly, the line from Monarch quickly played out, releasing the tug. However, Hercules' cables did not release until the last possible moment, leaving her tossing and pitching above the grave of the sunken Oklahoma. The battleship's exact location is unknown.[47]\\r\\nDuring dredging operations in 2006, the US Navy recovered a part of Oklahoma from the bottom of Pearl Harbor.[48] The Navy believes it to be a portion of the port side rear fire control tower support mast. It was flown to Tinker Air Force Base then delivered to the Muskogee War Memorial Park in Muskogee, in 2010, where the 40-foot-long (12?m), 25,000-pound (11,340?kg), barnacle-encrusted mast section is now on permanent outdoor display.[49]\\r\\nOn 7 December 2007, the 66th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a memorial for the 429 crew members who were killed in the attack was dedicated on Ford Island, just outside the entrance to where the battleship Missouri is docked as a museum. Missouri is moored where Oklahoma was moored when she was sunk.[50]\\r\\nOnly 35 of the 429 sailors and Marines who died on Oklahoma were identified in the years following the attack. The remains of 388 unidentified sailors and Marines were first interred as unknowns in the Nu'uanu and Halawa cemeteries, but were all disinterred in 1947, in an unsuccessful attempt to identify more personnel. In 1950, all unidentified remains from Oklahoma were buried in 61 caskets in 45 graves at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.[51]\\r\\nIn April 2015, the Department of Defense announced, as part of a policy change that established threshold criteria for disinterment of unknowns, that the unidentified remains of the crew members of Oklahoma would be exhumed for DNA analysis, with the goal of returning identified remains to their families.[52] The process began in June 2015, when four graves, two individual and two group graves, were disinterred.[53] As of December 2017, 100 Oklahoma unknowns had been identified by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.[54][55][56][57][58]\\r\\nCoordinates: 2458N 1506W? / ?24.967N 150.100W? / 24.967; -150.100?

It rises to 100 metres (330?ft) in the north, and to more than 1,000 metres (3,300?ft) in the south, forming a raised triangle within the South-pointing triangle of the Indian subcontinent's coastline.[2]\\r\\nIt extends over eight Indian states and encompasses a wide range of habitats, covering most of central and southern India.[3]\\r\\nThe plateau is located between two mountain ranges, the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats, each of which rises from its respective nearby coastal plain, and almost converge at the southern tip of India. It is separated from the Gangetic plain to the north by the Satpura and Vindhya Ranges, which form its northern boundary. The Deccan produced some of the major dynasties in Indian history Pallavas, Satavahana, Vakataka, Chalukya, and Rashtrakuta dynasties, the Western Chalukya, the Kadamba Dynasty, Kakatiya Empire, Vijayanagara and Maratha empires and the Muslim Bahmani Sultanate, Deccan Sultanate, and the Nizam of Hyderabad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Deccan is an anglicised form of the Prakrit word dakkhin or dakkha?a, itself derived from the Sanskrit word dk?i?a (meaning \\"southern\\"), as the Deccan Plateau is located in the southern part of the subcontinent.[4][5]\\r\\nThe Deccan region has historically lacked an enduring geo-political centre, and has been defined in various ways. Geographers have attempted to define it using indices such as rainfall, vegetation, soil type or physical features. When considering physical features, it is taken to be the area bounded by the Narmada River, the Eastern Ghats and the Western Ghats. The 16th-century historian Firishta defined Deccan as the territory inhabited by the native speakers of Kannada, Marathi, and Telugu languages. Richard M. Eaton (2005) also settled on this linguistic definition.[6]\\r\\nThe Western Ghats mountain range is very tall and blocks the moisture from the southwest monsoon from reaching the Deccan Plateau, so the region receives very little rainfall.[7][8] The eastern Deccan Plateau is at a lower elevation spanning the southeastern coast of India. Its forests are also relatively dry but serve to retain the rain to form streams that feed into rivers that flow into basins and then into the Bay of Bengal.[2][9]\\r\\nMost Deccan plateau rivers flow south. Most of the northern part of the plateau is drained by the Godavari River and its tributaries, including the Indravati River, starting from the Western Ghats and flowing east towards the Bay of Bengal. Most of the central plateau is drained by the Tungabhadra River, Krishna River and its tributaries, including the Bhima River, which also run east. The southernmost part of the plateau is drained by the Kaveri River, which rises in the Western Ghats of Karnataka and bends south to break through the Nilgiri Hills at the island town of Shivanasamudra and then falls into Tamil Nadu at Hogenakal Falls before flowing into the Stanley Reservoir and the Mettur Dam that created the reservoir, and finally emptying into the Bay of Bengal.\\r\\nThe climate of the region varies from semi-arid in the north to tropical in most of the region with distinct wet and dry seasons. Rain falls during the monsoon season from about June to October. March to June can be very dry and hot, with temperatures regularly exceeding 40?C. The Deccan plateau is a topographically variegated region located south of the Gangetic plains-the portion lying between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal-and includes a substantial area to the north of the Satpura Range, which has popularly been regarded as the divide between northern India and the Deccan. The name derives from the Sanskrit daksina (\\"south\\"). The plateau is bounded on the east and west by the Ghats, while its northern extremity is the Vindhya Range. The Deccan's average elevation is about 2,000 feet (600 m), sloping generally eastward; its principal rivers, the Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery, flow from the Western Ghats eastward to the Bay of Bengal. The plateau's climate is drier than that on the coasts and is arid in places. Although sometimes used to mean all of India south of the Narmada River, the word Deccan relates more specifically to that area of rich volcanic soils and lava-covered plateaus in the northern part of the peninsula between the Narmada and Krishna rivers.\\r\\nHaving once constituted a segment of the ancient continent of Gondwanaland, this land is the oldest and most stable in India. The Deccan plateau consists of dry tropical forests that experience only seasonal rainfall.\\r\\nOn the western edge of the plateau lie the Sahyadri, the Nilgiri, the Anaimalai and the Elamalai Hills, commonly known as Western Ghats. The average height of the Western Ghats, which run along the Arabian Sea, goes on increasing towards the south. Anaimudi Peak in Kerala, with a height of 2,695 m above sea level, is the highest peak of peninsular India. In the Nilgiris lie Ootacamund, the well-known hill station of southern India. The western coastal plain is uneven and swift rivers flow through it that forms beautiful lagoons and backwaters, examples of which can be found in the state of Kerala. The east coast is wide with deltas formed by the rivers Godavari, Mahanadi and Kaveri. Flanking the Indian peninsula on the western side are the Lakshadweep Islands in the Arabian Sea and on the eastern side lies the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal.\\r\\nThe eastern Deccan plateau, called Telangana and Rayalaseema, is made of vast sheets of massive granite rock, which effectively traps rainwater. Under the thin surface layer of soil is the impervious gray granite bedrock. It rains here only during some months.\\r\\nComprising the northeastern part of the Deccan Plateau, the Telangana Plateau has an area of about 148,000?km2, a north-south length of about 770?km, and an east-west width of about 515?km.\\r\\nThe plateau is drained by the Godavari River taking a southeasterly course; by the Krishna River, which divides the peneplain into two regions; and by the Pennai Aaru River flowing in a northerly direction. The plateau's forests are moist deciduous, dry deciduous, and tropical thorn.\\r\\nMost of the population of the region is engaged in agriculture; cereals, oilseeds, cotton, and pulses (legumes) are the major crops. There are multipurpose irrigation and hydroelectric-power projects, including the Pochampad, Bhaira Vanitippa, and Upper Pennai Aaru. Industries (located in Hyderabad, Warangal, and Kurnool) produce cotton textiles, sugar, foodstuffs, tobacco, paper, machine tools, and pharmaceuticals. Cottage industries are forest-based (timber, firewood, charcoal, bamboo products) and mineral-based (asbestos, coal, chromite, iron ore, mica, and kyanite).\\r\\nThe northwestern part of the plateau is made up of lava flows or igneous rocks known as the Deccan Traps. The rocks are spread over the whole of Maharashtra and parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, thereby making it one of the largest volcanic provinces in the world. It consists of more than 2,000 metres (6,600?ft) of flat-lying basalt lava flows and covers an area of nearly 500,000 square kilometres (190,000?sq?mi) in west-central India. Estimates of the original area covered by the lava flows are as high as 1,500,000 square kilometres (580,000?sq?mi). The volume of basalt is estimated to be 511,000 cubic km. The thick dark soil (called silt) found here is suitable for cotton cultivation\\r\\nThe volcanic basalt beds of the Deccan were laid down in the massive Deccan Traps eruption, which occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period between 67 and 66 million years ago. Some paleontologists speculate that this eruption may have accelerated the extinction of the dinosaurs. Layer after layer was formed by the volcanic activity that lasted many thousands of years, and when the volcanoes became extinct, they left a region of highlands with typically vast stretches of flat areas on top like a table. The volcanic hotspot that produced the Deccan traps is hypothesized to lie under the present day island of Runion in the Indian Ocean.[10]\\r\\nTypically the Deccan Plateau is made up of basalt extending up to Bhor Ghat near Karjat. This is an extrusive igneous rock. Also in certain sections of the region, we can find granite, which is an intrusive igneous rock. The difference between these two rock types is: basalt rock forms on eruption of lava, that is, on the surface (either out of a volcano, or through massive fissuresas in the Deccan basaltsin the ground), while granite forms deep within the Earth. Granite is a felsic rock, meaning it is rich in potassium feldspar and quartz. This composition is continental in origin (meaning it is the primary composition of the continental crust). Since it cooled relatively slowly, it has large visible crystals. Basalt, on the other hand, is mafic in compositionmeaning it is rich in pyroxene and, in some cases, olivine, both of which are Mg-Fe rich minerals. Basalt is similar in composition to mantle rocks, indicating that it came from the mantle and did not mix with continental rocks. Basalt forms in areas that are spreading, whereas granite forms mostly in areas that are colliding. Since both rocks are found in the Deccan Plateau, it indicates two different environments of formation.\\r\\nThe Deccan is rich in minerals. Primary mineral ores found in this region are mica and iron ore in the Chhota Nagpur region, and diamonds, gold and other metals in the Golconda region.\\r\\nThe large areas of remaining forest on the plateau are still home to a variety of grazing animals from the four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis), chinkara (Gazella bennettii), and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) to the large gaur and wild water buffalo (Bubalus arena).\\r\\nThe Deccan is home to many languages and people. Bhil and Gond people live in the hills along the northern and northeastern edges of the plateau, and speak various languages that belong to both the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian families of languages. Marathi, an Indo-Aryan language, is the main language of the north-western Deccan in the state of Maharashtra. Speakers of Telugu and Kannada, the predominant languages of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka respectively, occupy those states' portions of the plateau. The city of Hyderabad is an important center of the Urdu language in the Deccan; its surrounding areas also host a notable population of Urdu speakers. The Urdu dialect spoken in this region is also known as Dakhini or as Deccani, named after the region itself. Northeastern parts of the Deccan are in the state of Odisha. Odia, another Indo-Aryan language, is spoken in this part of Deccan.\\r\\nThe chief crop is cotton; also common are sugarcane, rice, and other crops.\\r\\nApart from the states already mentioned, the state of Chhattisgarh is found in the northeast corner of the plateau. The large cities in the Deccan are Pune, the cultural hub of Maharashtra, Nagpur, the winter capital of Maharashtra, Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka and Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Other major cities include Mysore, Gulbarga and Bellary in Karnataka; Amravati, Kolhapur, Latur and Aurangabad in Maharashtra; Amaravati, Visakhapatnam, Kurnool, Kadapa, Anantapur, Vijayawada, Guntur, Rajahmundry, Eluru, Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh; and Warangal, Karimnagar, Ramagundam, Nizamabad, Jammikunta, Mahbubnagar in present Telangana.\\r\\nThe Deccan produced some of the most significant dynasties in Indian History like the Chola dynasty, Satavahana dynasty, Vakataka dynasty, Kadamba dynasty, Chalukya dynasty, Rashtrakuta dynasty, Western Chalukya Empire, Vijayanagara Empire and Maratha Empire. Of the early history, the main facts established are the growth of the Mauryan empire (300 BC) and after that the Deccan was ruled by the Satavahana dynasty which protected the Deccan against the Scythian invaders, the Western Satraps.[11] Prominent dynasties of this time include the Cholas (3rd century BC to 12th century AD), Chalukyas (6th to 12th centuries), Rashtrakutas (753ÿ982), Hoysalas (10th to 14th centuries), Kakatiya (1083 to 1323 AD) and Vijayanagara Empire (1336ÿ1646). Ahir Kings once ruled over the Deccan. A cave inscription at Nasik refers to the reign of an Abhira prince named Ishwarsena, son of Shivadatta.[12] After the collapse of the Satavahana dynasty the Deccan was ruled by the Vakataka dynasty from the 3rd century to 5th century.\\r\\nFrom the 6th to 8th century the Deccan was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty which produced great rulers like Pulakesi II who defeated the north India Emperor Harsha or Vikramaditya II whose general defeated the Arab invaders in the 8th century. From the 8th to 10th century the Rashtrakuta dynasty ruled this region. It led successful military campaigns into northern India and was described by Arab scholars as one of the four great empires of the world.[13] In the 10th century the Western Chalukya Empire was established which produced scholars like the social reformer Basava, Vij?ne?vara, the mathematician Bhskara II and Someshwara III who wrote the text Manasollasa. From the early 11th century to the 12th century the Deccan Plateau was dominated by the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty.[14] Several battles were fought between the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty in the Deccan Plateau during the reigns of Raja Raja Chola I, Rajendra Chola I, Jayasimha II, Someshvara I and Vikramaditya VI and Kulottunga I.[15]\\r\\nIn 1294, Alauddin Khalji, emperor of Delhi, invaded the Deccan, stormed Devagiri, and reduced the Yadava rajas of Maharashtra to the position of tributary princes (see Daulatabad), then proceeding southward to conquer the Andhra, Carnatic. In 1307, a fresh series of Muslim incursions led by Malik Kafur began in response to unpaid tributes, resulting in the final ruin of the Yadava power; and in 1338 the conquest of the Deccan was completed by Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq. The imperial hegemony was brief, as soon Andhra and Karnataka reverted to their former masters. These defections by the Hindu states was soon followed by a general revolt of the Muslim governors, resulting in the establishment in 1347 of the independent Muslim dynasty of Bahmani.[16] The power of the Delhi sultanate evaporated south of the Narmada River. The southern Deccan came under the rule of the famous Vijayanagara Empire which reached its zenith during the reign of Emperor Krishnadevaraya.[17]\\r\\nIn the power struggles which ensued, the Hindu kingdom of Andhra fell bit by bit to the Bahamani dynasty, who advanced their frontier to Golkonda in 1373, to Warangal in 1421, and to the Bay of Bengal in 1472. Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire defeated the last remnant of Bahmani Sultanate power after which the Bahmani Sultanate collapsed.[18] When the Bahmani empire dissolved in 1518, its dominions were distributed into the five Muslim states of Golkonda, Bijapur, Ahmednagar, Bidar and Berar, giving rise to the Deccan sultanates.[16] South of these, the Hindu state of Carnatic or Vijayanagar still survived; but this, too, was defeated, at the Battle of Talikota (1565) by a league of the Muslim powers. Berar had already been annexed by Ahmednagar in 1572, and Bidar was absorbed by Bijapur in 1619. Mughal interest in the Deccan also rose at this time; Ahmadnagar was partially incorporated in the Empire in 1598 and as fully in 1636, Bijapur in 1686, and Golkonda in 1688.\\r\\nIn 1674, Shivaji laid the foundation of the Maratha Empire which within 75 years of his death covered territory of over 250?million acres (1 million km2) or one-third of the Indian sub-continent. Marathas under Shivaji directly challenged the foreign rule of the Bijapur Sultanate and ultimately the mighty Mughal empire. Once the Bijapur Sultanate stopped being a threat to the Maratha Empire, Marathas became much more aggressive and began to frequently raid Mughal territory. The Marathas had conquered part of central and western India by Shivaji's death in 1680. After Shivaji, Sambhaji defended the Maratha empire from the Mughal onslaught led by Aurangzeb. Marathas defeated Mughals in the prolonged war. After 1707, the Marathas acquired the right to levy tribute in southern India. After the death of Chhatrapati Shahu, the Peshwas became the de facto leaders of the Empire from 1749 to 1761, while Shivaji's successors continued as nominal rulers from their base in Satara. The Marathas kept the British at bay during the 18th century. By 1760, with the defeat of the Nizam in the Deccan, Maratha power had reached its zenith. However, dissension between the Peshwa and their sardars (army commanders) saw a gradual downfall of the Empire leading to its eventual annexation by the British East India Company in 1818 after the three Anglo-Maratha wars.\\r\\nA few years later, the Aurangzeb's viceroy in Ahmednagar, Nizam-ul-Mulk, established the seat of an independent government at Hyderabad in 1724. Mysore was ruled by Hyder Ali. During the contests for power which ensued from about the middle of the 18th century between the powers on the plateau, the French and British took opposite sides. After a brief course of triumph, the interests of France declined, and a new empire in India was established by the British. Mysore formed one of their earliest conquests in the Deccan. Tanjore and the Carnatic were soon annexed to their dominions, followed by the Peshwa territories in 1818.\\r\\nIn British India, the plateau was largely divided between the presidencies of Bombay and Madras. The two largest native states at that time were Hyderabad and Mysore; many smaller states existed at the time, including Kolhapur, and Sawantwari.\\r\\nAfter independence in 1947, almost all native states were incorporated into the Republic of India. Hyderabad refused to join, and was annexed by the Indian Army in Operation Polo in 1948.[19] In 1956, the States Reorganisation Act reorganized states along linguistic lines, leading to the states currently found on the plateau.\\r\\nThe Deccan plateau is very rich in minerals and precious stones.[20] The plateaus mineral wealth led many lowland rulers, including those of the Mauryan (4thÿ2nd century BCE) and Gupta (4thÿ6th century CE) dynasties, to fight over it.[21] Major minerals found here include coal, iron ore, asbestos, chromite, mica, and kyanite. Since March 2011, large deposits of uranium have been discovered in the Tummalapalle belt and in the Bhima basin at Gogi in Karnataka. The Tummalapalle belt uranium reserve promises to be one of the top 20?uranium reserve discoveries of the world.[22][23][24]\\r\\nLow rainfall made farming difficult until the introduction of irrigation. Currently, the area under cultivation is quite low, ranging from 60% in Maharastra to about 10% in Western Ghats.[25] Except in developed areas of certain river valleys, double-cropping is rare. Rice is the predominant crop in high-rainfall areas and sorghum in low-rainfall areas. Other crops of significance include cotton, tobacco, oilseeds, and sugar cane. Coffee, tea, coconuts, areca, pepper, rubber, cashew nuts, tapioca, and cardamom are widely grown on plantations in the Nilgiri Hills and on the western slopes of the Western Ghats. Cultivation of Jatropha has recently received more attention due to the Jatropha incentives in India.\\r\\nDeccan style\\r\\nCalligraphic emblem of sculpted sandstone ÿ 16th century\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 17N 77E? / ?17N 77E? / 17; 77","input":"What type of soil is found in deccan plateau region?"},{"output":"Flathead Lake","context":"Flathead Lake (Salish: ?lq?etk? [3]) is the largest natural freshwater lake by surface area that is west of the Mississippi River in the contiguous United States,[4][5] if one takes Red Lake and Lake of the Woods to be north of the Mississippi River, rather than west of the river.\\r\\nWith a surface area of between 191.5?sq?mi (496?km2)[1] and 197?sq?mi (510?km2), Flathead Lake is slightly larger in surface area than Lake Tahoe, but it is much smaller in volume.[2]\\r\\nThe lake is a remnant of the ancient, massive glacial dammed lake, Lake Missoula of the era of the last interglacial.[6] Flathead Lake is 27.3?mi (43.9?km) long and up to 15.5?mi (24.9?km) wide. Flathead Lake has a maximum depth of 370.7?ft (113.0?m),[1] and an average of 164.7?ft (50.2?m). This makes Flathead Lake deeper than the average depths of the Yellow Sea or the Persian Gulf. Polson Bay, at the lake's outlet, was raised 10?ft (3.0?m) by Kerr Dam.[7] It is one of the cleanest lakes in the populated world for its size and type.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLocated in the northwest corner of the state of Montana, 7?miles (11?km) south of Kalispell, it is approximately 30?miles (50?km) long and 16?miles (25?km) wide, covering 191.5?square miles (495.9?km2), making it approximate in size to Minnesota's Mille Lacs Lake and half the area of San Francisco Bay (main bay). Flathead Lake is 30?miles (48?km) southwest of Glacier National Park and is flanked by two scenic highways, which wind along its curving shoreline. On the west side is U.S. Route 93, and on the east, is Route 35.\\r\\nThe lake is bordered on its eastern shore by the Mission Mountains and on the west by the Salish Mountains. The Flathead valley was formed by the glacial damming of the Flathead River and sustains a remarkably mild climate for a region located this far north and inland; the Pacific Ocean is almost 400 miles to the west. The mild climate allows for cherry orchards on the east shore and vineyards for wine production on the west shore. There are also apple, pear and plum orchards around the lake as well as vegetables, hay, honey, nursery tree, Christmas tree, sod/turf and wheat production bordering or near the lake.\\r\\nOnce known as \\"Salish Lake\\", this body of water takes its name from the Salish (Flathead) Indians who live at the southern end of the lake on the Flathead Indian Reservation. Kerr Dam, near Polson, regulates the lake's water level and provides hydroelectric power and water for irrigation. The lake has an irregularly-shaped shoreline and a dozen small islands, the largest of which is a state park called Wild Horse Island. These islands cover 5.5 square miles (14.2 square kilometers). Besides the Flathead River, the Swan River (known also as the Bigfork River where it enters the lake) is the lake's other major tributary. The lake is inhabited by the native bull trout and cutthroat trout, as well as the non-native lake trout, yellow perch, and lake whitefish. Local residents have reported sighting other aquatic fauna in the lake as well, such as sturgeon and the Flathead Lake Monster.[9]\\r\\nThe opossum shrimp, Mysis diluviana, were introduced by Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks in the Flathead drainage basin to encourage production of larger kokanee salmon and wound up in Flathead Lake.[10] Lake trout had been introduced 80 years prior but remained at low densities until nonnative Mysis became established. The bottom-dwelling mysids eliminated a recruitment bottleneck for lake trout by providing a deep water source of food where little was available previously. Lake trout subsequently flourished on mysids and this voracious piscivore now dominates the lake fishery; formerly abundant kokanee were extirpated, and native bull and westslope cutthroat trout are imperiled. Predation by Mysis shifted zooplankton and phytoplankton community size structure. Bayesian change point analysis of primary productivity (27-y time series) showed a significant step increase of 55?mg C m?2 d?1 (i.e., 21% rise) concurrent with the mysid invasion, but little trend before or after despite increasing nutrient loading. Mysis facilitated predation by lake trout and indirectly caused the collapse of kokanee, redirecting energy flow through the ecosystem that would otherwise have been available to other top predators (bald eagles).[11]\\r\\nFlathead Lake lies at the southern end of a geological feature called the Rocky Mountain Trench. The trench, which formed with the Rocky Mountains, extends north into the southern Yukon as a straight, steep valley, which also holds the headwaters of the Columbia River. During the last ice age this trench was filled by an enormous glacier. As the glacier moved southward it carved out the trench. The Polson Moraine, near present-day Polson, Montana, marks the southernmost extent of the glacier during the last ice age and thus is the site of the glacier's terminal moraine.[12]\\r\\nThe large size of the Polson Moraine indicates that the glacier stalled here for many years before retreating. As the climate warmed, a portion of the glacier in the Mission Valley receded more slowly than the main body, which kept the lake basin from being filled with sediment. Eventually this ice also melted, forming a lake behind the moraine. Once the water reached the top of this moraine dam, it began to cut a channel through it. Most moraine dammed lakes drain quickly because water cuts entirely through the moraine. However, Flathead Lake remains because a bedrock hill buried underneath the Polson Moraine prevented the moraine from being completely cut through so the meltwater never completely drained.[12]\\r\\nAt one time, probably when the valley was partially filled by a glacier, the level of Flathead Lake was about 500 feet (150 m) higher and drained through the valley west of Elmo, Montana, which is at the end of Big Arm Bay, bottom center in the aerial photo above. Water carved out a wide, flat-bottomed pass with a deeper, narrow channel at the south edge of the pass. The deeper channel and traces of the dry riverbed are still visible from Route 28.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlathead Lake is home to a number of native and non-native fishes, and is managed cooperatively by both Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. The lake is home to home to the semi-annual \\"Mack Days\\" Lake Trout fishing contest, which aims to reduce the mackinaw (lake trout) populations, as well as educate people about the Flathead Lake Fisheries Management Plan.[13][14] Like the majority of other nonnative species, they became established in the lake from the late 1800s-early 1900s. The introduction of lake trout has placed increased pressure on the ecologically similar threatened bull trout.[15] Since the inception of this event in 2002, over 402,000 lake trout have been harvested.[16]\\r\\nIn addition to these commonly-pursued game fish, the lake is also home to other native species that currently aren't actively managed by government fish and wildlife agencies, including the Longnose Sucker, Redside Shiner, and Slimy Sculpin.","input":"What is the largest lake west of mississippi?"},{"output":"18 January 2002","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n Sierra Leone\\r\\n\\r\\n?United Kingdom\\r\\nECOMOG Forces Executive Outcomes\\r\\nSupported by:\\r\\n?Guinea\\r\\n?United States\\r\\n UNAMSIL\\r\\n\\r\\n RUF\\r\\n AFRC\\r\\nWest Side Boys\\r\\n Liberia\\r\\n\\r\\nSupported by:\\r\\n?Libya\\r\\n\\r\\n 4,000+ government soldiers and militiamen (1999) \\r\\nECOMOG: 700+ Nigerian soldiers\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Leone Civil War (1991ÿ2002) began on 23 March 1991 when the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), with support from the special forces of Charles Taylors National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), intervened in Sierra Leone in an attempt to overthrow the Joseph Momoh government.  The resulting civil war lasted 11 years, enveloped the country, and left over 50,000 dead.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first year of the war, the RUF took control of large swathes of territory in eastern and southern Sierra Leone, which were rich in alluvial diamonds. The government's ineffective response to the RUF, and the disruption in government diamond production, precipitated a military coup d'tat in April 1992 by the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC).[8] By the end of 1993, the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) had succeeded in pushing the RUF rebels back to the Liberian border, but the RUF recovered and fighting continued. In March 1995, Executive Outcomes (EO), a South Africa-based private military company, was hired to repel the RUF. Sierra Leone installed an elected civilian government in March 1996, and the retreating RUF signed the Abidjan Peace Accord.  Under UN pressure, the government terminated its contract with EO before the accord could be implemented, and hostilities recommenced.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1997 a group of disgruntled SLA officers staged a coup and established the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) as the new government of Sierra Leone.[11] The RUF joined with the AFRC to capture Freetown with little resistance. The new government, led by Johnny Paul Koroma, declared the war over.  A wave of looting, rape, and murder followed the announcement.[12] Reflecting international dismay at the overturning of the civilian government, ECOMOG forces intervened and retook Freetown on behalf of the government, but they found the outlying regions more difficult to pacify.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1999, world leaders intervened diplomatically to promote negotiations between the RUF and the government.[13] The Lome Peace Accord, signed on 27 March 1999, was the result. Lome gave Foday Sankoh, the commander of the RUF, the vice presidency and control of Sierra Leone's diamond mines in return for a cessation of the fighting and the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force to monitor the disarmament process.  RUF compliance with the disarmament process was inconsistent and sluggish, and by May 2000, the rebels were advancing again upon Freetown.[14] As the UN mission began to fail the United Kingdom declared its intention to intervene in the former colony and Commonwealth member in an attempt to support the weak government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. With help from a renewed UN mandate and Guinean air support, the British Operation Palliser finally defeated the RUF, taking control of Freetown. On 18 January 2002, President Kabbah declared the Sierra Leone Civil War over.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961, Sierra Leone gained its independence from the United Kingdom. In the years following the death of Sierra Leones first prime minister Sir Milton Margai in 1964, politics in the country were increasingly characterized by corruption, mismanagement, and electoral violence that led to a weak civil society, the collapse of the education system, and, by 1991, an entire generation of dissatisfied youth were attracted to the rebellious message of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and joined the organization.[15][16] Albert Margai, unlike his half-brother Milton, did not see the state as a steward of the public, but instead as a tool for personal gain and self-aggrandizement and even used the military to suppress multi-party elections that threatened to end his rule.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Siaka Stevens entered into politics in 1968 Sierra Leone was a constitutional democracy. When he stepped down, seventeen years later, Sierra Leone was a one-party state.[18] Stevens' rule, sometimes called the 17 year plague of locusts,[19] saw the destruction and perversion of every state institution. Parliament was undermined, judges were bribed, and the treasury was bankrupted to finance pet projects that supported insiders.[20] When Stevens failed to co-opt his opponents, he often resorted to state sanctioned executions or exile.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, Stevens stepped down, and handed the nations preeminent position to Major General Joseph Momoh, a notoriously inept leader who maintained the status quo.[20] During his seven-year tenure, Momoh welcomed the spread of unchecked corruption and complete economic collapse. With the state unable to pay its civil servants, those desperate enough ransacked and looted government offices and property. Even in Freetown, important commodities like gasoline were scarce. But the government hit rock bottom when it could no longer pay schoolteachers and the education system collapsed. Since only wealthy families could afford to pay private tutors, the bulk of Sierra Leones youth during the late 1980s roamed the streets aimlessly.[22] As infrastructure and public ethics deteriorated in tandem, much of Sierra Leones professional class fled the country. By 1991, Sierra Leone was ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world, even though it benefited from ample natural resources including diamonds, gold, bauxite, rutile, iron ore, fish, coffee, and cocoa.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eastern and Southern districts in Sierra Leone, most notably the Kono and Kenema districts, are rich in alluvial diamonds, and more importantly, are easily accessible by anyone with a shovel, sieve, and transport.[25] Since their discovery in the early 1930s, diamonds have been critical in financing the continuing pattern of corruption and personal aggrandizement at the expense of needed public services, institutions, and infrastructure.[26] The phenomenon whereby countries with an abundance of natural resources tend to nonetheless be characterized by lower levels of economic development is known as the \\"resource curse\\".[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of diamonds in Sierra Leone invited and led to the civil war in several ways. First, the highly unequal benefits resulting from diamond mining made ordinary Sierra Leoneans frustrated. Under the Stevens government, revenues from the National Diamond Mining Corporation (known as DIMINCO) ÿ a joint government/DeBeers venture ÿ were used for the personal enrichment of Stevens and of members of the government and business elite who were close to him.[28][29] When DeBeers pulled out of the venture in 1984, the government lost direct control of the diamond mining areas. By the late 1980s, almost all of Sierra Leone's diamonds were being smuggled and traded illicitly, with revenues going directly into the hands of private investors.[30][31] In this period the diamond trade was dominated by Lebanese traders and later (after a shift in favor on the part of the Momoh government) by Israelis with connections to the international diamond markets in Antwerp.[32] Momoh made some efforts to reduce smuggling and corruption in the diamond mining sector, but he lacked the political clout to enforce the law.[28] Even after the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) took power in 1992, ostensibly with the goal of reducing corruption and returning revenues to the state, high-ranking members of the government sold diamonds for their personal gain and lived extravagantly off the proceeds.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiamonds also helped to arm the Revolutionary United Front rebels. The RUF used funds harvested from the alluvial diamond mines to purchase weapons and ammunition from neighboring Guinea, Liberia, and even SLA soldiers.[34] But the most significant connection between diamonds and war is that the presence of easily extractable diamonds provided an incentive for violence.[35] To maintain control of important mining districts like Kono, thousands of civilians were expelled and kept away from these important economic centers.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough diamonds were a significant motivating and sustaining factor, there were other means of profiting from the Sierra Leone Civil War. For instance, gold mining was prominent in some regions. Even more common was cash crop farming through the use of forced labor. Looting during the Sierra Leone Civil War did not just center on diamonds, but also included that of currency, household items, food, livestock, cars, and international aid shipments. For Sierra Leoneans who did not have access to arable land, joining the rebel cause was an opportunity to seize property through the use of deadly force.[37] But the most important reason why the civil war should not be entirely attributed to conflict over the economic benefits incurred from the alluvial diamond mines is that the pre-war frustrations and grievances did not just concern that of the diamond sector. More than twenty years of poor governance, poverty, corruption and oppression created the circumstances for the rise of the RUF, as ordinary people yearned for change.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the First Liberian Civil War, 80,000 refugees fled neighboring Liberia for the Sierra Leone ÿ Liberian border. This displaced population, composed almost entirely of children, would prove to be an invaluable asset to the invading rebel armies because the refugee and detention centers, populated first by displaced Liberians and later by Sierra Leoneans, helped provide the manpower for the RUFs insurgency.[39] The RUF took advantage of the refugees, who were abandoned, starving, and in dire need of medical attention, by promising food, shelter, medical care, and looting and mining profits in return for their support.[40] When this method of recruitment failed, as it often did for the RUF, youths were often coerced at the barrel of a gun to join the ranks of the RUF. After being forced to join, many child soldiers learned that the complete lack of law ÿ as a result of the civil war ÿ provided a unique opportunity for self-empowerment through violence and thus continued to support the rebel cause.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuammar al-Gaddafi both trained and supported Charles Taylor.[42] Gaddafi also helped Foday Sankoh, the founder of Revolutionary United Front.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian businessman Viktor Bout supplied Charles Taylor with arms for use in Sierra Leone and had meetings with him about the operations.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial rebellion could have easily been quelled in the first half of 1991. But the RUF ÿ despite being both numerically inferior and extremely brutal against civilians ÿ controlled two-thirds of Sierra Leone by the years end. The SLAs equally poor behavior made this outcome possible.[25] Often afraid to directly confront or unable to locate the elusive RUF, government soldiers were brutal and indiscriminate in their search for rebels or sympathizers among the civilian population. After retaking captured towns, the SLA would perform a mopping up operation in which the towns people were transported to concentration camp styled strategic hamlets far from their homes in Eastern and Southern Sierra Leone under the pretense of separating the population from the insurgents. However, in many cases, this was followed by much looting and theft after the villagers were evacuated.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SLA's sordid behavior inevitably led to the alienation of many civilians and pushed some Sierra Leoneans to join the rebel cause. With morale low and rations even lower, many SLA soldiers discovered that they could do better by joining with the rebels in looting civilians in the countryside instead of fighting against them.[12] The local civilians referred to these soldiers as sobels or soldiers by day, rebels by night because of their close ties to the RUF. By mid-1993, the two opposing sides became virtually indistinguishable. For these reasons, civilians increasingly relied on an irregular force called the Kamajors for their protection.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nA grassroots militia force, the Kamajors operated invisibly in familiar territory and was a significant impediment to marauding government and RUF troops.[47] For displaced and unprotected Sierra Leonans, joining the Kamajors was a means of taking up arms to defend family and home due to the SLAs perceived incompetence and active collusion with the rebel enemy. The Kamajors clashed with both government and RUF forces and was instrumental in countering government soldiers and rebels who were looting villages.[48] The success of the Kamajors raised calls for its expansion, and members of street gangs and deserters were also co-opted into the organization. However, the Kamajors became corrupt and deeply involved in extortion, murder, and kidnappings by the end of the conflict.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin one year of fighting, the RUF offensive had stalled, but it still remained in control of large territories in Eastern and Southern Sierra Leone leaving many villages unprotected while also disrupting food and government diamond production. Soon the government was unable to pay both its civil servants and the SLA. As a result, the Momoh regime lost all remaining credibility and a group of disgruntled junior officers led by Captain Valentine Strasser overthrew Momoh on 29 April 1992.[8][50] Strasser justified the coup and the establishment of the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) by referencing the corrupt Momoh regime and its inability to resuscitate the economy, provide for the people of Sierra Leone, and repel the rebel invaders. The NPRCs coup was largely popular because it promised to bring peace to Sierra Leone.[51] But the NPRCs promise would prove to be short lived.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1993, with much help from ECOMOG troops provided by Nigeria, the SLA recaptured the Koidu and Kono diamond districts and pushed the RUF to the Sierra Leone ÿ Liberia border.[53] The RUF was facing supply problems as the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) gains inside Liberia were restricting the ability of Charles Taylors NPFL to trade with the RUF. By the end of 1993, many observers thought that the war was over because for the first time in the conflict the Sierra Leone Army was able to establish itself in the Eastern and the Southern mining districts.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, with senior government officials neglectful of the conditions faced by SLA soldiers, front line soldiers became resentful of their poor conditions and began helping themselves to Sierra Leones rich natural resources.[55] This included alluvial diamonds as well as looting and sell game, a tactic in which government forces would withdraw from a town but not before leaving arms and ammunition for the roving rebels in return for cash.[25] Renegade SLA soldiers even clashed with Kamajor units on a number of occasions when the Kamajors intervened to halt the looting and mining. The NPRC government also had a motivation for allowing the war to continue, since as long as the country was at war the military government would not be called upon to hand over rule to a democratically elected civilian government.[54] The war dragged on as a low intensity conflict until January 1995 when RUF forces and dissident SLA elements seized the SIEROMCO (bauxite) and Sierra Rutile (titanium dioxide) mines in the Moyamba and Bonthe districts in the country's south west, furthering the governments economic struggles and enabling a renewed RUF advance on the capital at Freetown.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1995, with the RUF within twenty miles of Freetown, Executive Outcomes, a paramilitary group from South Africa, arrived in Sierra Leone. The government paid EO $1.8 million per month (financed primarily by the International Monetary Fund),[57] to accomplish three goals: return the diamond and mineral mines to the government, locate and destroy the RUFs headquarters, and operate a successful propaganda program that would encourage local Sierra Leoneans to support the government of Sierra Leone.[15] EOs military force consisted of 500 military advisers and 3,000 highly trained and well-equipped combat-ready soldiers, backed by tactical air support and transport. Executive Outcomes employed black Angolans and Namibians from apartheid-era South Africas former 32 Battalion, with an officer corps of white South Africans.[58] Harpers Magazine described this controversial unit as a collection of former spies, assassins, and crack bush guerrillas, most of whom had served for fifteen to twenty years in South Africas most notorious counter insurgency units.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a military force, EO was extremely skilled and conducted a highly successful counter insurgency against the RUF. In just ten days of fighting, EO was able to drive the RUF forces back sixty miles into the interior of the country.[58] EO outmatched the RUF forces in all operations. In just seven months, EO, with support from loyal SLA and the Kamajors battalions, recaptured the diamond mining districts and the Kangari Hills, a major RUF stronghold.[60] A second offensive captured the provincial capital and the largest city in Sierra Leone and destroyed the RUFs main base of operations near Bo, finally forcing the RUF to admit defeat and sign the Abidjan Peace Accord in Abidjan, C?te d'Ivoire on 30 November 1996.[61] This period of relative peace also allowed the country to hold parliamentary and presidential elections in February and March 1996.[62] Ahmad Tejan Kabbah (of the Sierra Leone People's Party [SLPP]), a diplomat who had worked at the UN for more than 20 years, won the presidential election.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Abidjan Peace Accord mandated that Executive Outcomes was to pull out within five weeks after the arrival of a neutral peacekeeping force. The main stumbling block that prevented Sankoh from signing the agreement sooner was the number and type of peacekeepers that were to monitor the ceasefire.[13][64] Additionally, continued Kamajor attacks and the fear of punitive tribunals following demobilization kept many rebels in the bush despite their dire situation. However, in January 1997, the Kabbah government ÿ beset by demands to reduce expenditures by the International Monetary Fund ÿ ordered EO to leave the country, even though a neutral monitoring force had yet to arrive.[10][61] The departure of EO opened up an opportunity for the RUF to regroup for renewed military attacks.[10] The March 1997 arrest of RUF leader Foday Sankoh in Nigeria also angered RUF members, who reacted with escalated violence. By the end of March 1997, the peace accord had collapsed.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the departure of Executive Outcomes, the credibility of the Kabbah government declined, especially among members of the SLA, who saw themselves being eclipsed by both the RUF on one side and the independent but pro-government Kamajors on the other.[66] On 25 May 1997, a group of disgruntled SLA officers freed and armed 600 prisoners from the Pademba Road prison in Freetown. One of the prisoners, Major Johnny Paul Koroma, emerged as the leader of the coup and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) proclaimed itself the new government of Sierra Leone.[11] After receiving the blessing of Foday Sankoh, who was then living under house arrest in Nigeria, members of the RUF ÿ supposedly on its last legs ÿ were ordered out of the bush to participate in the coup. Without hesitation and encountering only light resistance from SLA loyalists, 5,000 rag-tag rebel fighters marched 100 miles and overran the capital. Without fear or reluctance, RUF and SLA dissidents then proceeded to parade peacefully together. Koroma then appealed to Nigeria for the release of Foday Sankoh, appointing the absent leader to the position of deputy chairman of the AFRC.[67] The joint AFRC/RUF leadership then proclaimed that the war had been won, and a great wave of looting and reprisals against civilians in Freetown (dubbed \\"Operation Pay Yourself\\" by some of its participants) followed.[68][69] President Kabbah, surrounded only by his bodyguards, left by helicopter for exile in nearby Guinea.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AFRC junta was opposed by members of Sierra Leone's civil society such as student unions, journalists associations, women's groups and others, not only because of the violence it unleashed but because of its political attacks on press freedoms and civil rights.[71] The international response to the coup was also overwhelmingly negative.[72] The UN and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) condemned the coup, foreign governments withdrew their diplomats and missions (and in some cases evacuated civilians) from Freetown, and Sierra Leone's membership in the Commonwealth was suspended.[73] The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) also condemned the AFRC coup, and ECOMOG forces demanded that the new junta return power peacefully to the Kabbah government or risk sanctions and increased military presence.[74][75]\\r\\n\\r\\nECOMOGs intervention in Sierra Leone brought the AFRC/RUF rebels to the negotiating table where, in October 1997, they agreed to a tentative peace known as the Conakry Peace Plan.[76] Despite having agreed to the plan, the AFRC/RUF continued to fight. In March 1998, overcoming entrenched AFRC positions, the ECOMOG forces retook the capital and reinstated the Kabbah government, but let the rebels flee without further harassment.[77][78] The regions lying just beyond Freetown proved much more difficult to pacify. Thanks in part to bad road conditions, lack of support aircraft, and a revenge driven rebel force, ECOMOGs offensive ground to a halt just outside Freetown. ECOMOGs forces suffered from several weakness, the most important being, poor command and control, low morale, poor training in counterinsurgency, low manpower, limited air and sea capability, and poor funding.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnable to consistently defend itself against the AFRC/RUF rebels, the Kabbah regime was forced to make serious concessions in the Lome Peace Agreement of July 1999.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven that Nigeria was due to recall its ECOMOG forces without achieving a tactical victory over the RUF, the international community intervened diplomatically to promote negotiations between the AFRC/RUF rebels and the Kabbah regime.[81] The Lome Peace Accord, signed on 7 July 1999, is controversial in that Sankoh was pardoned for treason, granted the position of Vice President, and made chairman of the commission that oversaw Sierra Leones diamond mines.[82] In return, the RUF was ordered to demobilize and disarm its armies under the supervision of an international peacekeeping force which would initially be under the authority of both ECOMOG and the United Nations. The Lome Peace Agreement was the subject of protests both in Sierra Leone and by international human rights groups abroad, mainly because it handed over to Sankoh, the commander of the brutal RUF, the second most powerful position in the country, and control over all of Sierra Leones lucrative diamond mines.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the Lome Peace Agreement, the security situation in Sierra Leone was still unstable because many rebels refused to commit themselves to the peace process.[13][83] The DDR camps were an attempt to convince the rebel forces to literally exchange their weapons for food, clothing, and shelter.[84] During a six-week quarantine period, former combatants were taught basic skills that could be put to use in a peaceful profession after they return to society. After 2001, DDR camps became increasingly effective and by 2002 they had collected over 45,000 weapons and hosted over 70,000 former combatants.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1999 the UN established the United Nations Mission to Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). The main objective of UNAMSIL was to assist with the disarmament process and enforce the terms established under the Lome Peace Agreement.[13] Unlike other previous neutral peacekeeping forces, UNAMSIL brought serious military power.[86] The original multi-national force was commanded by General Vijay Jetley of India.[87] Jetley later resigned and was replaced by Lieutenant General Daniel Opande of Kenya in November 2000.[88] Jetley  had accused Nigerian political and military officials at the top of the UN mission of \\"sabotaging peace\\" in favor of national interests, and alleged that Nigerian army commanders illegally mined diamonds in league with RUF.[89] The Nigerian army called for General Jetley's resignation immediately after the report was released, saying they could no longer work with him.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nUNAMSIL forces began arriving in Sierra Leone in December 1999. At that time the maximum number of troops to be deployed was set at 6,000. Only a few months later, though, in February 2000, a new UN resolution authorized the deployment of 11,000 combatants.[90] In March 2001 that number was increased to 17,500 troops, making it at the time the largest UN force in existence,[88] and UNAMSIL soldiers were deployed in the RUF-held diamond areas. Despite these numbers, UNAMSIL was frequently rebuffed and humiliated by RUF rebels, being subjected to attacks, obstruction and disarmament. In the most egregious example, in May 2000 over 500 UNAMSIL peacekeepers were captured by the RUF and held hostage. Using the weapons and armored personnel carriers of the captured UNAMSIL troops, the rebels advanced towards Freetown, taking over the town of Lunsar to its northeast.[14] For over a year later, the UNAMSIL force meticulously avoided intervening in RUF controlled mining districts lest another major incident occur.[91] After the UNAMSIL force had essentially rearmed the RUF, a call for a new military intervention was made to save the UNAMSIL hostages and the government of Sierra Leone.[86] After Operation Palliser and Operation Khukri the situation stabilized and UNAMSIL gain control.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1999, the UN Security Council asked Russia for participation in a peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone. The Federation Council of Russia decided to send 4 Mil Mi-24 attack helicopters with 115 crew and technical personnel into Sierra Leone.[2] Many of them had combat experience in Afghanistan and Chechnya. The destroyed Lungi civil airfield in the suburbs of Freetown became their base of operations. A Ukrainian Detached Recovery and Restoring Battalion, and aviation team were stationed near Freetown. The two post-Soviet troop contingents got along well, and left together after the UN mandate for peacekeeping operations ended in June 2005.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOperation Khukri was a unique multinational operation launched in the United Nations Assistance Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), involving India, Nepal, Ghana, Britain and Nigeria. The aim of the operation was to break the two-month-long siege laid by armed cadres of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) around two companies of 5/8 Gorkha Rifles (GR) Infantry Battalion Group at Kailahun by affecting a fighting break out and redeploying them with the main battalion at Daru.[92]  About 120 special forces operators commanded by Major (now Lt. Col.) Harinder Sood were airlifted from New Delhi to spearhead the mission to rescue 223 men of the 5/8 Gorkha Rifles who were surrounded and besieged by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels for over 75 days. The mission was a total success which resulted in safe rescue of all the besieged men  and inflicted several hundreds of casualties on the RUF, where Indian troops were part of a multinational UN peacekeeping force.[93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2000, the situation on the ground had deteriorated to such an extent that British Paratroopers were deployed in Operation Palliser to evacuate foreign nationals and establish order.[95] They stabilized the situation, and were the catalyst for a ceasefire that helped end the war. The British forces, under the command of Brigadier David Richards, expanded their original mandate, which was limited to evacuating commonwealth citizens, and now aimed to save UNAMSIL from the brink of collapse. At the time of the British intervention in May 2000, half of the country remained under the RUFs control. The 1,200 man British ground force ÿ supported by air and sea power ÿ shifted the balance of power in favor of the government and the rebel forces were easily repelled from the areas beyond Freetown.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral factors led to the end of the civil war. First, Guinean cross-border bombing raids against villages believed to be bases used by the RUF working in conjunction with Guinean dissidents were very effective in routing the rebels.[97][98] Another factor encouraging a less combative RUF was a new UN resolution that demanded that the government of Liberia expel all RUF members, end their financial support of the RUF, and halt the illicit diamond trade.[99] Finally, the Kamajors, feeling less threatened now that the RUF was disintegrating in the face of a robust opponent, failed to incite violence like they had done in the past. With their backs against the wall and without any international support, the RUF forces signed a new peace treaty within a matter of weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 January 2002, President Kabbah declared the eleven-year-long Sierra Leone Civil War officially over.[100] By most estimates, over 50,000 people had lost their lives during the war.[7][101] Countless more fell victim to the reprehensible and perverse behavior of the combatants. In May 2002 President Kabbah and his party, the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), won landslide victories in the presidential and legislative elections. Kabbah was re-elected for a five-year term. The RUF's political wing, the Revolutionary United Front Party (RUFP), failed to win a single seat in parliament. The elections were marked by irregularities and allegations of fraud, but not to a degree that significantly affected the outcome.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Sierra Leone Civil War numerous atrocities were committed including war rape, mutilation, and mass murder, causing many of the perpetrators to be tried in international criminal courts, and the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission. A 2001 overview noted that there had been serious and grotesque human rights violations in Sierra Leone since its civil war began in 1991.The rebels, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), had committed horrendous abuses. The report noted that 25 times as many people had already been killed in Sierra Leone than had been killed in Kosovo at the point when the international community decided to take action. In fact, it has been pointed out by many that the atrocities in Sierra Leone have been worse than was seen in Kosovo.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese crimes included but are not limited to:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 July 2002 the British withdrew a 200-strong military contingent that had been in country since the summer of 2000, leaving behind a 140-strong military training team with orders to professionalize the SLA and Navy. In November 2002, UNAMSIL began a gradual reduction from a peak level of 17,800 personnel.[120] Under pressure from the British, the withdrawal slowed, so that by October 2003 the UNAMSIL contingent still stood at 12,000 men. As peaceful conditions continued through 2004, however, UNAMSIL drew down its forces to slightly over 4,100 by December 2004. The UN Security Council extended UNAMSILs mandate until June 2005 and again until December 2005. UNAMSIL completed the withdrawal of all troops in December 2005 and was succeeded by the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL).[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lome Peace Accord called for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to provide a forum for both victims and perpetrators of human rights violations during the conflict to tell their stories and facilitate healing. Subsequently, the Sierra Leonean government asked the UN to help set up a Special Court for Sierra Leone, which would try those who \\"bear the greatest responsibility for the commission of crimes against humanity, war crimes and serious violations of international humanitarian law, as well as crimes under relevant Sierra Leonean law within the territory of Sierra Leone since 30 November 1996.\\" Both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Special Court began operating in the summer of 2002.[122][123]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war many of the children who were abducted and used in the conflict need some form of rehabilitation, debriefing and care after the conflict came to an end. Only a handful of the children could be immediately sent home after six weeks of debriefing at a center for ex-combatants. This is due to many of the children suffering from drug withdraw symptoms, brainwashing, physical and mental wounds, as well as a lack of memory of who they were or where they came from before the conflict.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an estimated one to two million displaced persons and refugees who wanted to or needed to be returned to their villages.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nReportedly thousands of small villages had been severely damaged due to looting, and targeted destruction of property that was held by perceived enemies. There was also heavy destruction of clinics and hospitals, leading to a concern about infrastructure stability.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Union [EU] sent budgetary support with the support of the IMF, the World Bank and the UK in an effort to stabilize the economy and the government. The amount; ? 4,75 million was made available by the EU from 2000 to 2001, for the government finance interalia, and social services.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiamond revenues in Sierra Leone have increased more than tenfold since the end of the conflict, from $10 million in 2000 to about $130 million in 2004, although according to the UNAMSIL surveys of mining sites, \\"more than 50 per cent of diamond mining still remains unlicensed and reportedly considerable illegal smuggling of diamonds continues\\".[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 January 2003, a small group of armed men tried unsuccessfully to break into an armory in Freetown. Former AFRC-junta leader Koroma, after being linked to the raid, went into hiding. In March, the Special Court for Sierra Leone issued its first indictments for war crimes during the civil war. Foday Sankoh, already in custody, was indicted, along with notorious RUF field commander Sam \\"Mosquito\\" Bockarie, Koroma, the Minister of Interior and former head of the Civil Defense Force, Samuel Hinga Norman, and several others. Norman was arrested when the indictments were announced, while Bockarie and Koroma remained at large (presumably in Liberia). On 5 May 2003, Bockarie was killed in Liberia. President Charles G. Taylor expected to be indicted by the Special Court and had feared Bockaries testimony.[127] He is suspected of ordering Bockarie's murder, although no indictments are pending.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral weeks later, word filtered out of Liberia that Koroma had been killed as well, although his death remains unconfirmed. In June the Special Court announced Taylors indictment for war crimes.[129] Sankoh died in prison in Freetown on 29 July 2003 from a pulmonary embolism.[130] He had been ailing since a stroke the year prior.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2003 President Kabbah testified before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on his role during the civil war. On 1 December 2003, Major General Tom Carew, who had been the Chief of Defence Staff for the Government of Sierra Leone and an important figure in the Sierra Leonean Army, was reassigned to civilian duties. In June 2007, the Special Court found three of the eleven people indicted ÿ Alex Tamba Brima, Brima Bazzy Kamara and Santigie Borbor Kanu ÿ guilty of war crimes, including acts of terrorism, collective punishments, extermination, murder, rape, outrages upon personal dignity, conscripting or enlisting children under the age of 15 years into armed forces, enslavement and pillage.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe civil war served as the background for the 2006 movie Blood Diamond, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly.[133] During the end of the movie Lord of War, Yuri Orlov (played by Nicolas Cage) sells arms to militias during the civil war. The militias are allied with Andr Baptiste (Eamonn Walker), who is based on Charles Taylor.[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of children in both the rebel (RUF) military and the government militia is depicted in Ishmael Beah's 2007 memoir, A Long Way Gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2012 Documentary La vita non perde valore, by Wilma Massucco, former child soldiers and some of their victims talk about the way how they feel and live, ten years after the Sierra Leone civil war ending, thanks to the personal, familiar and social rehabilitation provided to them by Father Giuseppe Berton, an Italian missionary of the Xaverian order. The documentary has been analyzed in different Universities, becoming subject of various degrees,.[135][136]\\r\\n\\r\\nMariatu Kamara wrote about being attacked by the rebels and having her hands chopped off in her book The Bite of the Mango. Ishmael Beah wrote a foreword to Kamara's book.[137]\\r\\n\\r\\nJonathon Torgovnik wrote about eight women that he interviewed after the war had ended in his book; Girl Soldier: Life After War in Sierra Leone. In the book he describes the experiences of the eight women who were abducted during the war and forced to fight in it.[138]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe documentary movie Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars tells the story of a group of refugees who fled to Guinea and created a band to ease the pain of the constant difficulty of living away from home and community after the atrocities of war and mutilation.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000 the Sierra Leonean journalist, cameraman and editor, Sorious Samura released his documentary Cry Freetown. The self-funded film depicted the most brutal period of the civil war in Sierra Leone with RUF rebels capturing the capital city in the late 1990s. The film won, among other awards, an Emmy Award and a Peabody.","input":"When did the sierra leone civil war end?"},{"output":"Mohammad Yaqoob Mir","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Meghalaya High Court is the High Court of the state of Meghalaya.[1]  It was established in March 2013, after making suitable amendments in the Constitution of India and North-Eastern Areas (Re-organisation) Act of 1971.

R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. Such creatures first appeared in print in his novel The Lord of the Rings, where the Fellowship of the Ring encounter one known as Durin's Bane in the Mines of Moria. Balrogs figured in Tolkien's earlier writings that appeared posthumously in The Silmarillion and other books.\\r\\nBalrogs are described as tall and menacing with the ability to shroud themselves in fire, darkness, and shadow. They frequently appeared armed with fiery whips \\"of many thongs\\",[1] and occasionally used long swords. In Tolkien's later conception, they could not be readily vanquisheda certain stature was required by the would-be hero. Only dragons rivalled their capacity for ferocity and destruction,[2] and during the First Age of Middle-earth, they were among the most feared of Morgoth's forces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to The Silmarillion, the evil Vala Melkor corrupted lesser Maiar (angelic beings) to his service in the days of his splendor before the making of Arda.[3][4] These became known as \\"Demons of Might\\": Valaraukar in Quenya, and (with an anglicized plural) Balrogs in Sindarin.\\r\\nUpon the awakening of the Elves, the Valar captured Melkor and destroyed his fortresses Utumno and Angband. But they overlooked the deepest pits,[5] where, with many of Melkor's other allies, the Balrogs fled into hiding. When Melkor returned to Middle-earth from Valinor, now bearing the epithet Morgoth, he was attacked by Ungoliant, a spider-like creature; his piercing scream drew the Balrogs out of hiding to his rescue.\\r\\nWhen the Noldor arrived in Beleriand in pursuit of Morgoth, they won a swift victory over his Orcs in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. F?anor pressed on towards Angband, but the Balrogs came against him, and F?anor was mortally wounded by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs. F?anor's sons fought off the Balrogs, but F?anor died of his wounds shortly afterward.[6]\\r\\nIn The Lays of Beleriand, The Lay of Leithian mentions Balrog captains leading Orcs: \\"the Orcs went forth to rape and war, and Balrog captains marched before\\".[7]\\r\\nTolkien tells of two Balrogs slain by Elves in the fall of Gondolin.[8] During the assault on the city, Ecthelion of the Fountain fought Gothmog, and \\"each slew the other.\\" Glorfindel fought a Balrog who waylaid an escape party from the fallen city; both fell from the mountainside in the struggle and perished.\\r\\nIn the War of Wrath that ended the First Age, most of the Balrogs were destroyed, although some including the Balrog known as Durin's Bane, managed to escape and hide in \\"caverns at the roots of the earth\\".[9]\\r\\nIn The Fellowship of the Ring, the Fellowship ventured through Moria and were attacked in the Chamber of Mazarbul by Orcs and the Balrog.[10] Gandalf faced the Balrog at the Bridge of Khazad-d?m and broke the Bridge, but was dragged down by the Balrog. He slew the Balrog but perished himself at the same timeto be sent back as the more powerful Gandalf the White.\\r\\nTolkien's conception of Balrogs changed over time. In all his early writing, they are numerous. A host of a thousand of them is mentioned in the Quenta Silmarillion,[11] while at the storming of Gondolin Balrogs in the hundreds ride on the backs of the Dragons.[12] They are roughly of twice[13] human size,[14] and were occasionally killed in battle by Elves and Men.[15] They were fierce demons, associated with fire, armed with fiery whips of many thongs and claws like steel, and Morgoth delighted in using them to torture his captives.[16] They were loyal to Morgoth, and once came out of hiding to save him from capture.\\r\\nIn the published version of The Lord of the Rings, however, Balrogs became altogether more sinister and more powerful. Christopher Tolkien notes the difference, saying that in earlier versions they were \\"less terrible and certainly more destructible\\". He quotes a very late margin note[17] that was not incorporated into the text saying \\"at most seven\\" ever existed;[18] though in the Annals of Aman, written as late as 1958, after the publication of The Lord of the Rings, Melkor still commands \\"a host of Balrogs\\".[19] In later writings they ceased to be creatures, but are instead Maiar, lesser Ainur like Gandalf or Sauron, spirits of fire whom Melkor had corrupted before the creation of the World.[3] Power of the order of Gandalf's was necessary to destroy them,[20] and as Maiar, only their physical forms could be destroyed.\\r\\nTolkien says of the Valar (including the Maiar) that they can change their shape at will, and move unclad in the raiment of the world, meaning invisible and without form.[21] But it seems that Morgoth, Sauron, and their associated Maiar could lose this ability: Morgoth, for example, was unable to heal his burns from the Silmarils or wounds from Fingolfin and Thorondor;[22] and Sauron lost his ability to assume a fair-seeming form after his physical body was destroyed in the downfall of N~menor.[23]\\r\\nTolkien does not address this specifically for Balrogs though at least in his later conception they are Maiar. In \\"the Bridge of Khazad-d?m\\" in The Fellowship of the Ring, the Balrog appears \\"like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater\\". Though previously the Balrog had entered the \\"large square chamber\\" of Mazarbul, at the Bridge of Khazad-d?m it \\"drew itself to a great height, and its wings spread from wall to wall\\" in what was a vast hall.\\r\\nThe Balrog's size and shape, therefore, are not given precisely. When Gandalf threw it from the peak of Zirakzigil, the Balrog \\"broke the mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin\\".[24]\\r\\nWhether Balrogs have wings (and if so, whether they can fly) is unclear. This is due partly to Tolkien's changing conception of Balrogs, but mostly to his imprecise but suggestive and possibly figurative description of the Balrog that confronted Gandalf in Moria.[10]\\r\\nThe two key quotations:\\r\\nHis enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings.\\r\\n suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall \\r\\nThe argument hinges on whether the \\"wings\\" are physical wings or simply figurative wings of shadow. Many additional facts are adduced to the argument, but there is not enough firm description in Tolkien's writing to settle the matter definitively.[25][26]\\r\\nThe Balrog of Moria used a flaming sword (\\"From out of the shadow a red sword leapt flaming\\") and the characteristic many-thonged whip of flame in its battle with Gandalf. In The Silmarillion, they also used black axes and maces.[27] Earlier writings also speak of steel claws and iron mail.[28]\\r\\nIn earlier drafts of The Lord of the Rings, some further indications of Tolkien's evolving conceptions appear. Notably,\\r\\nA figure strode to the fissure, no more than man-high yet terror seemed to go before it. They could see the furnace-fire of its eyes from afar; its arms were very long; it had a red [?tongue].[29]\\r\\nAt this writing Tolkien contemplated an edict of the Valar concerning Balrogs, having Gandalf challenge the Balrog by saying:\\r\\nIt is forbidden for any Balrog to come beneath the sky since Fionwe son of Manwe overthrew Thangorodrim.[30]\\r\\nThe name \\"Balrog,\\" but not the meaning, emerges early in Tolkien's work: it appears in the Fall of Gondolin, one of the earliest texts Tolkien wrote (ca. 1918). An early list of names described Balrog as \\"an Orc-word with no pure equivalent in Tolkien's invented language of Quenya: 'borrowed Malaroko-'?\\".[31]\\r\\nIn Gnomish (another of Tolkien's invented languages) Balrog is parsed as balc 'cruel' + graug 'demon', with a Quenya equivalent Malkarauke. Variant forms of the latter include Nalkarauke and Valkarauke.[32]\\r\\nBy the 1940s, when Tolkien began writing The Lord of the Rings, he had come to think of Balrog as Noldorin balch 'cruel' + rhaug 'demon', with a Quenya equivalent Malarauko (from nwalya- 'to torture' + rauko 'demon').[33]\\r\\nThe last etymology, appearing in the invented languages Quendi and Eldar, derives Balrog as the Sindarin translation of the Quenya form Valarauko (Demon of Might). This etymology was published in The Silmarillion.[34]\\r\\nThe Sindarin plural for Balrog is not known. Tolkien consistently used Balrogs, but this is generally considered an anglicization because Sindarin does not form plurals that way. In one case Tolkien used Balrogath,[35] similar to Periannath 'Halflings' and Dagorath 'battles'. However, the -ath suffix was often used as a 'class plural' (cf. giliath 'all stars of the firmament'), and thus Balrogath might mean 'Balrogkind' rather than simply 'Balrogs'. Linguists disagree about how a simple Sindarin plural would be formed. The historically justified form would likely be *Balroeg. This takes into account the fact that the older singular would have been *Balraug (compare the Quenya cognate Valarauko): The Sindarin umlaut product of au is known to be oe. If analogy prevailed in later Sindarin, the plural form *Belryg might however have replaced the historically justified plural. Compare, for instance, annon \\"gate\\" having the plural form ennyn.\\r\\nThe plural of Quenya Valarauko (also Valarauka) is attested as Valaraukar.[34]\\r\\nGandalf on the bridge of Khazad-d?m calls the Balrog \\"flame of Ud?n\\" (Ud?n being the Sindarin name of Morgoth's fortress Utumno).\\r\\nAn etymon existing before Tolkien's languages (of which he surely would have known): the Norse 'bl' means 'fire,' and an epithet of Odin, likely referring to his warlike nature, was 'Bleygr,' or 'fire-eyed.'[citation needed]\\r\\nGothmog appears in various versions of Silmarillion material. He is physically massive and strong, and in one version he is some 12 feet tall.[37] He wields a black axe and whip of flame as his weapons.\\r\\nHe holds the titles of the Lord of the Balrogs (but see Lungorthin below), the High Captain of Angband, and Marshal of the Hosts.\\r\\nIn the Second Battle, Dagor-nuin-Giliath, he leads a force that ambushes F?anor and wounds him mortally. He leads Balrogs, Orc-hosts, and Dragons as Morgoth's commander in the field in the Fifth Battle, Nrnaeth Arnoediad, and slays Fingon, High King of the Noldor. In that same battle, he captures H~rin of Dor-l܇min, who had slain his personal guard of Battle-trolls, and brings him to Angband. As Marshal of the Hosts, he is in command of the Storming of Gondolin. He is about to kill Tuor when Ecthelion of the Fountain, a Noldorin Elf-lord, intervenes. Gothmog fights Ecthelion in single combat, and they kill each other.\\r\\nIn The Book of Lost Tales, Tolkien describes Kosomot, the original version of Gothmog, as a son of Morgoth and the ogress Fluithuin or Ulbandi.[38]\\r\\nGothmog is Sindarin and means 'Dread Oppressor'.[39]\\r\\nKosomot is often considered Gothmog's Quenya name;[40] however, in the Quenya name-list of The Fall of Gondolin another version appears, Kosomoko.[41]\\r\\nIn The Lord of the Rings, a different character bears the name \\"Gothmog\\"; see Gothmog (Third Age).\\r\\nLungorthin appears in Tolkien's early Lay of the Children of H~rin as \\"Lungorthin, Lord of Balrogs\\". This might be another name for Gothmog (above), though Christopher Tolkien thought it more likely that Lungorthin was simply \\"a Balrog lord\\".[42]\\r\\nThis Balrog appears in The Lord of the Rings, encountered by the Fellowship of the Ring in the Mines of Moria.\\r\\nIt survived the defeat of Morgoth in the War of Wrath and escaped to hide beneath the Misty Mountains.[43] For more than five millennia, the Balrog remained in its deep hiding place at the roots of Caradhras,[44] one of the Mountains of Moria, until in the Third Age the mithril-miners of the Dwarf-kingdom of Khazad-d?m disturbed it (or released it from its prison) in T.A.?1980. The Balrog promptly killed Durin VI, the King of Khazad-d?m, whereafter it was called Durin's Bane by the Dwarves.[43][45]\\r\\nThe Dwarves attempted to fight the Balrog, but its power was far too great. In their efforts to hold Khazad-d?m against it, many Dwarves were killed: Durin's successor King Nin only a year after his father. The survivors were forced to flee. This disaster also reached the Silvan Elves of L܇rien, many of whom also fled the \\"Nameless Terror\\"[43] (it was not recognized as a Balrog at the time). The Elves called the place Moria, the \\"Black Pit\\"[46] or \\"Black Chasm\\"[47] (though the name Moria also appears on the West Gate of Moria, constructed thousands of years earlier in the Second Age).\\r\\nFor another 500 years, Moria was left to the Balrog; though according to Unfinished Tales, Orcs crept in almost immediately after the Dwarves were driven out, leading to Nimrodel's flight.[48] Around T.A.?2480 Sauron began to put his plans for war into effect, and he sent Orcs and Trolls to the Misty Mountains to bar all of the passes:[45] Some of these creatures came to Moria, and the Balrog allowed them to remain.\\r\\nDuring the reign of Thrin II, the Dwarves attempted to retake Moria in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, culminating in the Battle of Azanulbizar before the eastern gate of Moria in T.A.?2799. This was a victory for the Dwarves, but the presence of the Balrog prevented them from reoccupying Moria. Din Ironfoot, having slain the Orc Azog near the gate, perceived the terror of the Balrog within[43] and warned Thrin that Moria was unachievable until some force could change the world and remove the Balrog. The Dwarves thus departed and resumed their exile. In T.A.?2989, despite Din's warning, Balin made another attempt to retake Moria.[45] Though his party was initially successful in starting a colony, they were massacred a few years later.\\r\\nIn 'January' T.A.?3019, the Fellowship of the Ring travelled through Moria on the way to Mount Doom. They were attacked in the Chamber of Mazarbul by Orcs.[10] The Fellowship fled through a side door, but when the wizard Gandalf the Grey tried to place a \\"shutting spell\\" on the door to block the pursuit behind them, the Balrog entered the chamber on the other side and cast a \\"terrible\\" counterspell. Gandalf spoke a word of Command to stay the door, but the door shattered and the chamber collapsed. Gandalf was severely weakened by this encounter. The company fled with him, but the Orcs and the Balrog, taking a different route, caught up with them at the bridge of Khazad-d?m. The Elf Legolas instantly recognized the Balrog and Gandalf tried to hold the bridge against it. As Gandalf faced the Balrog he proclaimed, \\"You cannot pass, flame of Ud?n!\\", and broke the bridge beneath the Balrog. As it fell, the Balrog wrapped its whip about Gandalf's knees, dragging him to the brink. As the Fellowship looked on in horror, Gandalf cried \\"Fly, you fools!\\" and plunged into the darkness below.\\r\\nAfter a long fall, the two crashed into a deep subterranean lake, which extinguished the flames of the Balrog's body; however it remained \\"a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake\\". They fought in the water, with the Balrog clutching at Gandalf to strangle him, and Gandalf hewing the Balrog with his sword, until finally the Balrog fled into ancient tunnels of unknown origin. Gandalf pursued the creature for eight days, until they climbed to the peak of Zirakzigil, where the Balrog was forced to turn and fight once again, its body erupting into new flame. Here they fought for two days and nights. In the end, the Balrog was defeated and cast down, breaking the mountainside where it fell \\"in ruin\\".[24] Gandalf himself died shortly afterwards, but he was later sent back to Middle-earth with even greater powers, as Gandalf the White, \\"until his task was finished\\".\\r\\nAs there are no known dimensions for a Balrog, there are differing representations in the various film adaptations, some of which are capable of flight.","input":"What is the creature in the mines of moria?"},{"output":"early care and education","context":"Child and Youth Care (CYC) is a profession or craft which focuses on the developmental needs of children and families within the space and time of their daily lives.[1] Child and Youth Care is primarily a way of working with others and practitioners can be found in a variety of roles including direct care, private practice, educator, trainer, writer, supervisor, manager, researcher, and more.

Resources for this were always extremely limited and minimally staffed and the service could seldom see beyond a bed with a bedside locker and minimal food and adult attention. There was little or no staff training, with child-staff ratios often being as poor as 1:30.\\r\\nIt was those same staff members who originally bootstrapped their own training programs by soliciting the help of well-intentioned social workers and teachers into voluntary training opportunities, and rudimentary syllabi were developed into shared coursework. Similar grassroots efforts led to the formation, for example, of the National Association of Child Care Workers in South Africa, who over the years took over much of the organisation and work of this (largely voluntary) corps of teachers and child care workers, and who established further connections with helpful professionals.\\r\\nPractitioners work in a variety of settings, such as early care and education, community-based child and youth development programs, parent education and family support, school-based programs, community mental health, group homes, residential centers, rehabilitation programs, pediatric health care, and juvenile justice programs.\\r\\nThe scope of practice from the Council of Canadian Child and Youth Care Associations provides a helpful definition of the field:\\r\\n\\"Child and youth care practitioners work with children, youth and families with complex needs.

Child and youth care workers specialize in the development and implementation of therapeutic programs and planned environments and the utilization of daily life events to facilitate change. At the core of all effective child and youth care practice is a focus on the therapeutic relationship; the application of theory and research about human growth and development to promote the optimal physical, psycho-social, spiritual, cognitive, and emotional development of young people towards a healthy and productive adulthood; and a focus on strengths and assets rather than pathology.\\" [2]\\r\\nThe first week of May is International Child and Youth Care Week with the first Thursday being Thank a Youth Worker Day.\\r\\nThere are a number of professional associations for Child and Youth Care Workers around the world.\\r\\nEducation for Child and Youth Care Practitioners varies around the world.

The company is owned by the British Government's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, through Postal Services Holding Company Limited.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPost Office branches, along with the Royal Mail delivery service, were formerly part of the General Post Office and later the Post Office corporation. Post Office Counters Ltd was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Post Office corporation in 1986. After the Post Office corporation was renamed Royal Mail Group in 2001, Post Office Counters Ltd became Post Office Ltd.[3]\\r\\nPost Office Ltd has in recent years announced losses; a reported S102 million in 2006. This has raised many concerns in the media regarding Post Office Ltd's ability as a company to operate efficiently.[4] Plans to cut the S150m-a-year subsidy for rural post offices led to the announcement that 2,500 local post offices were to be closed. This announcement resulted in a backlash from local communities that relied on the service.\\r\\nIn 2007, the government gave a S1.7 billion subsidy to Royal Mail Group so that it could turn a profit by 2011. This was to be used to invest across the whole network of Royal Mail, Post Office Ltd and Parcelforce. 85 Crown post offices were closed, 70 of which were sold to WHSmith. This followed a trial of six Post Office outlets in WHSmith stores. WHSmith was expected to make up to S2.5 million extra in annual profit. 2,500 sub-post offices closed between 2008 and 2009. Redundancy packages were provided from public funding (subpostmasters were paid over 20 months salary, roughly S65,000 each).[5]\\r\\nIn November 2010, the government committed S1.34 billion of funding up to 2015 to Post Office Ltd to enable it to modernise the Post Office network.[6]\\r\\nAs part of the Postal Services Act 2011, Post Office Ltd became independent of Royal Mail Group on 1 April 2012.[7] A ten-year inter-business agreement was signed between the two companies to allow post offices to continue issuing stamps and handling letters and parcels for Royal Mail.[8] The Act also contained the option for Post Office Ltd to become a mutual organisation in the future.[9]\\r\\nOn 8 February 2013, Post Office Ltd announced it was planning to move around seventy of its Crown post offices into shops. This would reduce the Crown network, which it stated was losing S40 million a year, to around 300.[10]\\r\\nOn 27 November 2013, the government committed an additional S640 million of funding for 2015 to 2018 to allow Post Office Ltd to complete its network modernisation.[11]\\r\\nThere are currently around 11,500 post office branches across the UK, of which 300 are directly managed by Post Office Ltd (known as Crown offices).

The incumbent president, Goodluck Jonathan sought his second and final term.\\r\\nThe elections were first scheduled to be held on 14 February 2015. However, the electoral commission postponed it by six weeks to 28 March, mainly due to the poor distribution of Permanent Voter Cards, and also to curb ongoing Boko Haram insurgency in certain north-eastern states.[5] The government closed its land and sea borders from midnight on 25 March until the end of the polling date.[6] The election was extended to 29 March due to delays and technical problems with the biometric card readers.[7]\\r\\nIt was the most expensive election ever to be held on the African continent.[8] Nigeria is the continent's most populous country, has its largest economy and is its leading oil producer. Opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari won the presidential election by more than 2.5?million votes.[9] Incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan conceded defeat on 31 March, before the results from all 36 states had been announced.[10] The election marks the first time an incumbent president has lost re-election in Nigeria. The President-elect was sworn-in on 29 May 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 134 (2) of the Nigerian Constitution stipulates that a presidential candidate will be duly elected after attaining both the highest number of votes cast, and having received at least a quarter of the votes at each of at least two-thirds of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). If no candidate satisfies the requirement, a second election will be held between the two leading candidates within seven days from the pronouncement of the result.[11]\\r\\nIt had long been assumed that incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan would run for re-election, as despite declining approval ratings, he was still thought to be popular and had several high-profile supporters.[12] Jonathan officially confirmed his candidacy on 11 November at a rally in Abuja, announcing to cheering supporters:[13]\\r\\n\\"After seeking the face of God, and in the quiet of my family, and after listening to the clarion call of Nigerians, I have accepted to present myself to serve a second term.\\"\\r\\nJonathan ran unopposed in the People's Democratic Party (PDP) primaries on 10 December 2014, receiving the nomination of the party. However, this was against an unwritten rule that the PDP's presidential candidacy should alternate between Muslim northerners and Christian southerners, and opposition to Jonathan's candidacy had led to the defection of dozens of PDP MPs in the House of Representatives.[14]\\r\\nPrior to the elections,[when?] the All Progressives Congress was formed as an alliance of four opposition parties, the Action Congress of Nigeria, the Congress for Progressive Change, the All Nigeria Peoples Party, and the All Progressives Grand Alliance.[citation needed]\\r\\nIts primaries, also held on 10 December, were won by retired Major General Muhammadu Buhari,[14] who defeated Kano State Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha and newspaper editor Sam Nda Isaiah.[15] On 17 December, APC chose Professor Yemi Osinbajo as the running mate of General M. Buhari.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs of February 2015, \\"Though the APC's voter base is in the north, it enjoys support all over the country, unlike the opposition in 2011.\\"[16]\\r\\nA presidential and Vice presidential Debate was conducted by the Nigerian media with majority of the candidates attending. The debate was attended by the then incumbent president Goodluck Jonathan, and his vice Namadi Sambo, while as predicted, the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Muhammadu Buhari boycotted the debate while his vice presidential nominee attended. The debate which lasted for approximately an hour was watched by over 20 million people in Nigeria, with radios and the Internet conveying through other means.\\r\\nFourteen candidates contested the election.[17]\\r\\nThe main opposition Goodluck Jonathan faced was from Muhammadu Buhari of the APC. While inaugurating a 250-bed Orthopaedic Hospital in Wamakko, Buhari said: We will stop corruption and make the ordinary people, the weak and the vulnerable our top priority.[18]\\r\\nAfter a botched governor's election in Anambra State, there were serious concerns that the election would not go smoothly. The country's election commission had promised a better election process, hoping that combating electoral fraud would prevent the violence that had plagued previous Nigerian elections.[12] Despite this, a pre-election poll by Gallup noted that only 13% of Nigerians had confidence in the honesty of elections.[20]\\r\\nThe Socialist Party of Nigeria filed for registration as a political party to contest the election, but the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) refused the registration. The SPN sued the INEC at the Federal High Court, claiming that INEC had failed to respond to their petition within 30 days as prescribed by law and that thus it would have to be registered automatically.[21]\\r\\nThe presidential election was a trending topic in Nigeria on Twitter, one social media platform reflecting public opinion; although PDP/GEJ may simply have had better support on social media, which is not representative of the population as a whole. According to Impact Social, based on data from 40,000 tweets, Facebook messages, blogs, and other internet outlets that mention PDP or GEJ, 70% of public opinion toward President Jonathan is positive, but messaging on the economy has taken up 6% of election conversation and was seen as a key PDP strength. Social media support for Buhari/APC was a bit \\"noisier\\" without a single issue leveraged by the campaign to gain traction: there was general frustration that the campaign lacked consistency, content and focus on the important issues at hand.[22]\\r\\nIn January 2015, the #bringbackourgirls campaign raised alarm over plans by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to exclude Chibok and some communities currently under the control of the Boko Haram from getting the permanent voter cards (PVCs) for the February elections.[23] Jonathan's already controversial handling of the situation was exacerbated by the Twitter campaign that was launched in mid 2014, #BringBackJonathan2015, which was widely considered to be insensitive to the victims and their families. Jonathan eventually called for banners containing the hashtag to be taken down and asked for the hashtag to not be used.[24]\\r\\nOn 8 February 2015, the Independent National Electoral Commission announced that \\"presidential and national assembly elections will now hold on 28 March while the governorship and state assemblies election will take place on 11 April,[25]\\" mainly due to the poor distribution of Permanent Voter Cards, and also the security concerns related to the Boko Haram insurgency in certain north eastern states.\\r\\nThe postponement was called on the grounds of the INEC failing to deliver Permanent Voters' Cards to millions (around 34%) of voters ÿ reportedly only around 45.1mn of 68.8mn registered voters had received PVC's. Additionally, on 5 February, the National Council of State (chaired by President Jonathan) told INEC that it had just launched a major, decisive offensive against Boko Haram for six weeks. Due to the assets and resources that would go into this offensive, the military would be unable to provide security and logistics support for elections. This is a disputable claim, since election security is the primary responsibility of not the military (which should only act as support) but the police and civil defence corps. There is speculation over whether or not the postponement was motivated by politics rather than security and has raised questions over the political neutrality of the military as well as the independence of INEC.[26]\\r\\n[27] Sambo Dasuki, Nigerian national security advisor, told the commission \\"that operations against Boko Haram militants meant the military \\"will be unable to provide adequate security\\" for the 14 February vote.\\"[28] \\"Seventeen out of the 28 registered political parties\\" supported postponing the elections; 12 opposed, \\"including the leading opposition party, All Progressives Congress\\".[29] By 30 January, \\"Boko Haram was in total occupation/complete control of 13 local governments (and other swathes of land) in Borno and 2 each in Yobe and Adamawa.\\"[30] Critics of the postponement view it as a political move on behalf of GEJ/PDP rather than one made in the interest of national security. GEJ/PDP are losing traction due to gains by Boko Haram in January, economic strains from the slide in global oil price (Nigerias key export), and GEJ/PDPs slow progress on fighting corruption and improving infrastructure. According to primaries in December 2014, Buhari/APC is viewed as more equipped to fight insecurity and corruption.\\r\\nCritics have pointed out that even with the postponement, the Nigerian government is unlikely to re-establish control in all the affected areas by the date of the election. Distribution of the Permanent Voters' Card (PVC) has begun in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) from the three affected states. Estimates of the number of IDPs range from 868,235 to 1.5 million people, and is not yet clear how successful efforts will be to organise elections under these circumstances.[30] Key Government officials in Nigeria are publicly stating their opposition to the postponement. Senator Chris Ngige, for example, has accused the PDP of pressuring INEC to postpone the general elections.[31]\\r\\nIn addition to growing criticism within Nigeria, on 8 February Vanguard reported that \\"the United States said it was 'deeply disappointed' by the delay.\\" US Secretary of State John Kerry, who had urged that elections be held on time, \\"[warned] the Nigerian government against using 'security concerns as a pretext for impeding the democratic process.'\\"[32] Additionally, the British Foreign Secretary, Phillip Hammond, has revealed that he, too, is disgruntled by the news: The security situation should not be used as a reason to deny the Nigerian people from exercising their democratic rights. It is vital that the elections are kept on track and held as soon as possible. [33] Deutsche Welle reported that \\"The postponement has been seen by critics as a ploy by President Goodluck Jonathan and the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) to buy time to sway support from the popular main opposition candidate and former military dictator, Muhammadu Buhari.\\"[28]\\r\\nBy 7 February 2015, threats of post-election violence from both sides remained a concern, given that hundreds of people died in the rioting that followed the 2011 Nigerian presidential election,[28] and rhetoric was running high. It was reported that \\"the Council of Imams and Ulamas in Kaduna State ... told the Niger Delta militants threatening chaos if President Goodluck Jonathan loses the presidential election that they stand to lose if there is a war.\\"[34] The GMB Volunteers, a group described as a \\"frontline voluntary organization made up of professionals, ethnic and religious groups,\\" has criticised hate advertisements directed against APC candidate General Muhammadu Buhari.[35]\\r\\nOn 9 February, although \\"Nigerian civil society\\" was \\"in uproar\\" over the postponement, the north east remained calm, and voters there appeared willing to wait.[36]\\r\\nGroups such as the Nigeria Stability and Reconciliation Programme (NSRP) have \\"advised political parties to stop making hate speeches against opponents.\\"[37]\\r\\nThe Nigeria Women Platform for Peaceful Election (NWPPE) is collaborating with United Nations Women to hold training sessions for journalists on gender-based violence and gender sensitive reporting. A \\"women situation room\\", similar to a \\"civil society situation room\\" is planned for monitoring violence against women during the elections.[38]\\r\\nSenator Abubakar Bukola Saraki, who has called the postponement \\"an obstruction of democracy\\", nonetheless released a statement saying \\"I charge Nigerians to be calm, non-violent and steadfast. We must be determined to make sure postponement does not demoralize or disenfranchise us. We must see this as a challenge for us to remain resolute in yearning for a new democratic government; one that will not see itself as above the people.\\"[39]\\r\\nOn 31 January, a concert was held in Owerri, Imo State, as part of the RSVP concert series, urging young people to RSVP ÿ Register, Select, Vote and Protect. \\"Register ÿ pick your Permanent Voters' card-PVC, Select (select your candidates), and Vote ÿ vote not Fight, and Protect ÿ protect your mandate.\\" A second RSVP concert was planned for Lagos on 8 February.[40]\\r\\nThe postponement was the topic of a Council on Foreign Relations online conference call with John Campbell on 28 February 2015.[41]\\r\\nAccording to the Nigerian Constitution, the presidential election must be held by 28 April.[36] As Section 25 of the 2010 Electoral Act states, the date is to be no later than 30 days before the expiration of the previous office holder's term of office.[42]\\r\\nBuhari was supported by The Economist \\"with a heavy heart\\" as \\"the least awful\\" option; the newspaper was scathing about the repression and economic policy of Buhari's previous regime, but praised his subsequent adherence to democratic process, anti-corruption stance, and the legitimacy he held in the Muslim North as a stronger platform with which to combat Boko Haram.[43]\\r\\nThe website of the Independent National Electoral Commission was hacked on election day by a group calling itself the Nigerian Cyber Army.[44]\\r\\nVoting was extended due to technical problems with electronic card readers.[45] The technology was introduced to prevent voter fraud, but was opposed by President Goodluck Jonathan who called it a \\"huge national embarrassment\\" when problems caused a delay. President Jonathan himself failed to be accredited by the card reader, which was shown live on national television.[46]\\r\\nBoko Haram attempted to disrupt the election by attacking voting centres, killing 41 people.[47][48] An opposition politician, Umaru Ali, was gunned down in one attack.[49][50]\\r\\nThe Jos Forum Inter-communal Dialogue Process was established to serve as a sustainable and impartial dialogue mechanism to be used by the communities to handle disputes.[51] In 2015, the Jos Peace Dialogue Forum has already served as a platform for various political parties to discuss challenges and commit to peaceful elections in 2015.[52]\\r\\nElection observer missions [EOM] were deployed from the African Union (AU), Commonwealth of Nations, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the European Union (EU); and were led by Amos Sawyer,[53] Bakili Muluzi,[54] John Kufuor,[55] and Santiago Fisas respectively.[56]\\r\\nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated the citizens and the government for conducting a peaceful and orderly election.[57] The AUEOM concluded that the elections were conducted in a \\"peaceful atmosphere\\" and met the \\"continental and regional principles of democratic elections\\".[53] ECOWAS EOM said that it met the \\"criteria of being free and transparent\\" despite \\"pockets of incidents and logistical challenges.\\"[55] The Commonwealth EOM described the conduct as \\"generally peaceful and transparent.\\"[58]","input":"When was the last election conducted in nigeria?"},{"output":"On 20 July 1954","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench Indochina (previously spelled as French Indo-China)[1] (French: Indochine fran?aise; Lao: ???????????????; Khmer: ?????????????; Vietnamese: ??ng D??ng thu?c Php/?|??, IPA:?[???w?m j???? t???k fҊp], frequently abbreviated to ??ng Php; Chinese: YCHE), officially known as the Indochinese Union (French: Union indochinoise)[2] after 1887 and the Indochinese Federation (French: Fdration indochinoise) after 1947, was a grouping of French colonial territories in Southeast Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nA grouping of the three Vietnamese regions of Tonkin (north), Annam (centre), and Cochinchina (south) with Cambodia was formed in 1887. Laos was added in 1893 and the leased Chinese territory of Guangzhouwan in 1898. The capital was moved from Saigon (in Cochinchina) to Hanoi (Tonkin) in 1902 and again to Da Lat (Annam) in 1939. In 1945 it was moved back to Hanoi.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Fall of France during World War II, the colony was administered by the Vichy government and was under Japanese occupation until March 1945, when the Japanese overthrew the colonial regime. After the Japanese surrender, the Viet Minh, a communist organization led by H? Ch Minh, declared Vietnamese independence, but France subsequently took back control of French Indochina. An all-out independence war, known as the First Indochina War, broke out in late 1946 between French and Viet Minh forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to create a political alternative to the Viet Minh, the State of Vietnam, led by former Emperor B?o ??i, was proclaimed in 1949. On 9 November 1953 the Kingdom of Cambodia proclaimed its independence. Following the Geneva Accord of 1954, the French evacuated Vietnam and French Indochina came to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranceÿVietnam relations started in early 17th century with the mission of the Jesuit missionary Alexandre de Rhodes. At this time, Vietnam was only just beginning to occupy the Mekong Delta, former territory of the Indianised kingdom of Champa which they had defeated in 1471.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean involvement in Vietnam was confined to trade during the 18th century. In 1787, Pierre Pigneau de Behaine, a French Catholic priest, petitioned the French government and organised French military volunteers to aid Nguy?n nh in retaking lands his family lost to the Tay S?n. Pigneau died in Vietnam but his troops fought on until 1802 in the French assistance to Nguy?n nh.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance was heavily involved in Vietnam in the 19th century; often French intervention was undertaken in order to protect the work of the Paris Foreign Missions Society in the country. For its part, the Nguy?n dynasty increasingly saw Catholic missionaries as a political threat; courtesans, for example, an influential faction in the dynastic system, feared for their status in a society influenced by an insistence on monogamy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1858, the brief period of unification under the Nguy?n dynasty ended with a successful attack on Da Nang by French Admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly under the orders of Napoleon III. Diplomat Charles de Montigny's mission having failed, Genouilly's mission was to stop attempts to expel Catholic missionaries. His orders were to stop the persecution of missionaries and assure the unimpeded propagation of the faith.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1858, fourteen French gunships, 3,000 men and 300 Filipino troops provided by the Spanish[5] attacked the port of Tourane (present day Da Nang), causing significant damage and occupying the city. After a few months, Rigault had to leave the city due to supply issues and illnesses.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSailing south, de Genouilly then captured the poorly defended city of Saigon on 18 February 1859. On 13 April 1862, the Vietnamese government was forced to cede the three provinces of Bin Ha, Gia ??nh and ??nh T??ng to France. De Genouilly was criticised for his actions and was replaced by Admiral Page in November 1859, with instructions to obtain a treaty protecting the Catholic faith in Vietnam, but refrain from territorial gains.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench policy four years later saw a reversal, with the French continuing to accumulate territory. In 1862, France obtained concessions from Emperor T? ??c, ceding three treaty ports in Annam and Tonkin, and all of Cochinchina, the latter being formally declared a French territory in 1864. In 1867 the provinces of Chau ??c, H Tin and V?nh Long were added to French-controlled territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1863, the Cambodian king Norodom had requested the establishment of a French protectorate over his country. In 1867, Siam (modern Thailand) renounced suzerainty over Cambodia and officially recognised the 1863 French protectorate on Cambodia, in exchange for the control of Battambang and Siem Reap provinces which officially became part of Thailand. (These provinces would be ceded back to Cambodia by a border treaty between France and Siam in 1906).\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance obtained control over northern Vietnam following its victory over China in the Sino-French War (1884ÿ85). French Indochina was formed on 17 October 1887 from Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina (which together form modern Vietnam) and the Kingdom of Cambodia; Laos was added after the Franco-Siamese War in 1893.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federation lasted until 21 July 1954. In the four protectorates, the French formally left the local rulers in power, who were the Emperors of Vietnam, Kings of Cambodia, and Kings of Luang Prabang, but in fact gathered all powers in their hands, the local rulers acting only as figureheads.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench troops landed in Vietnam in 1858 and by the mid-1880s they had established a firm grip over the northern region. From 1885 to 1895, Phan ?nh Phng led a rebellion against France. Nationalist sentiments intensified in Vietnam, especially during and after World War I, but all the uprisings and tentative efforts failed to obtain sufficient concessions from the French.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerritorial conflict in the Indochinese peninsula for the expansion of French Indochina led to the Franco-Siamese War of 1893. In 1893 the French authorities in Indochina used border disputes, followed by the Paknam naval incident, to provoke a crisis. French gunboats appeared at Bangkok, and demanded the cession of Lao territories east of the Mekong River.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Chulalongkorn appealed to the British, but the British minister told the King to settle on whatever terms he could get, and he had no choice but to comply. Britain's only gesture was an agreement with France guaranteeing the integrity of the rest of Siam. In exchange, Siam had to give up its claim to the Thai-speaking Shan region of north-eastern Burma to the British, and cede Laos to France.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French continued to pressure Siam, and in 1902 they manufactured another crisis.[clarification needed] This time Siam had to concede French control of territory on the west bank of the Mekong opposite Luang Prabang and around Champasak in southern Laos, as well as western Cambodia. France also occupied the western part of Chantaburi.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1904, to get back Chantaburi, Siam had to give Trat and Koh Kong to French Indochina. Trat became part of Thailand again on 23 March 1907 in exchange for many areas east of the Mekong like Battambang, Siam Nakhon and Sisophon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1930s, Siam engaged France in a series of talks concerning the repatriation of Siamese provinces held by the French. In 1938, under the Front Populaire administration in Paris, France had agreed to repatriate Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Siem Reap, Siem Pang and the associated provinces (approximately 13) to Siam. Meanwhile, Siam took over control of those areas, in anticipation of the upcoming treaty. Signatories from each country were dispatched to Tokyo to sign the treaty repatriating the lost provinces.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 February 1930, there was an uprising by Vietnamese soldiers in the French colonial army's Yn Bi garrison. The Yn Bi mutiny was sponsored by the Vi?t Nam Qu?c Dan ??ng (VNQD?). The VNQD? was the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. The attack was the largest disturbance brewed up by the C?n V??ng monarchist restoration movement of the late 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of the revolt was to inspire a wider uprising among the general populace in an attempt to overthrow the colonial authority. The VNQD? had previously attempted to engage in clandestine activities to undermine French rule, but increasing French scrutiny of their activities led to their leadership group taking the risk of staging a large scale military attack in the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, Thailand took the opportunity of French weaknesses to reclaim previously lost territories, resulting in the Franco-Thai War between October 1940 and 9 May 1941. The Thai forces generally did well on the ground, but Thai objectives in the war were limited. In January, Vichy French naval forces decisively defeated Thai naval forces in the Battle of Ko Chang. The war ended in May at the instigation of the Japanese, with the French forced to concede territorial gains for Thailand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1940, during World War II, the newly created regime of Vichy France granted Japan's demands for military access to Tonkin following the Japanese occupation of French Indochina, which lasted until the end of the Pacific War. This allowed Japan better access to China in the Second Sino-Japanese War against the forces of Chiang Kai-shek, but it was also part of Japan's strategy for dominion over the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThailand took this opportunity of weakness to reclaim previously lost territories, resulting in the Franco-Thai War between October 1940 and 9 May 1941.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 March 1945, with France liberated, Germany in retreat, and the United States ascendant in the Pacific, Japan decided to take complete control of Indochina and destroyed the French colonial administration. Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were proclaimed as independent states, members of Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Japanese kept power in Indochina until the news of their government's surrender came through in August. The general disorganization of French Indochina, coupled with several natural disasters, caused a dreadful famine in Northern and Central Vietnam. Several hundred thousands people ÿ possibly over one million ÿ are believed to have starved to death in 1944ÿ45.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the World War, France petitioned for the nullification of the 1938 Franco-Siamese Treaty and reasserted itself in the region, but came into conflict with the Viet Minh, a coalition of Communist and Vietnamese nationalists led by H? Ch Minh, founder of the Indochinese Communist Party. During World War II, the United States had supported the Viet Minh in resistance against the Japanese; the group had been in control of the countryside since the French gave way in March 1945.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican President Roosevelt and General Stilwell privately made it adamantly clear that the French were not to reacquire French Indochina after the war was over. He told Secretary of State Cordell Hull the Indochinese were worse off under the French rule of nearly 100 years than they were at the beginning. Roosevelt asked Chiang Kai-shek if he wanted Indochina, to which Chiang Kai-shek replied: \\"Under no circumstances!\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war, 200,000 Chinese troops under General Lu Han  sent by  Chiang Kai-shek  invaded northern Indochina north of the 16th parallel to accept the surrender of Japanese occupying forces, and remained there until 1946.[7] The Chinese used the VNQD?, the Vietnamese branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, to increase their influence in Indochina and put pressure on their opponents.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nChiang Kai-shek threatened the French with war in response to manoeuvering by the French and Ho Chi Minh against each other, forcing them to come to a peace agreement, and in February 1946 he also forced the French to surrender all of their concessions in China and renounce their extraterritorial privileges in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina and allowing French troops to reoccupy the region starting in March 1946.[9][10][11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter persuading Emperor B?o ??i to abdicate in his favour, on 2 September 1945 President Ho Chi Minh declared independence for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. But before September's end, a force of British and Free French soldiers, along with captured Japanese troops, restored French control. Ho Chi Minh agreed to negotiate with the French in order to gain autonomy, but the Fontainebleau Agreements of 1946 failed to produce a satisfactory solution. Bitter fighting ensued in the First Indochina War as Ho and his government took to the hills. In  1949, in order to provide a political alternative to Ho Chi Minh, the French favored the creation of a unified State of Vietnam?: former Emperor B?o ??i was put back in power. Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia became associated states of the French Union and were granted more autonomy. \\r\\n\\r\\n1950, however was the turning point of the war. Ho's government was recognised by the fellow Communist governments of China and the Soviet Union and Mao's government subsequently gave a fallback position to Ho's forces, as well as abundant supplies of weapons. In October 1950, the French army suffered its first major defeat with the battle of Route Coloniale 4. Subsequent efforts by the French military managed to improve their situation only in the short term.  B?o ??i's State of Vietnam proved a weak and unstable government, and Norodom Sihanouk's Cambodia proclaimed its independence in November 1953.  Fighting lasted until May 1954, when the Viet Minh won the decisive victory against French forces at the gruelling battle of ?i?n Bin Ph?.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 20 July 1954, the Geneva Conference produced the Geneva Agreements between North Vietnam and France. Provisions included supporting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Indochina, granting it independence from France, declaring the cessation of hostilities and foreign involvement in internal Indochina affairs, and delineating northern and southern zones into which opposing troops were to withdraw. The Agreements mandated unification on the basis of internationally supervised free elections to be held in July 1956.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at this conference that France relinquished any claim to territory in the Indochinese peninsula. The United States and South Vietnam rejected the Geneva Accords and never signed. South Vietnamese leader Diem rejected the idea of nationwide election as proposed in the agreement, saying that a free election was impossible in the communist North and that his government was not bound by the Geneva Accords. France did withdraw, turning the north over to the Communists while the B?o ??i regime, with American support, kept control of the South.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events of 1954 marked the beginnings of serious United States involvement in Vietnam and the ensuing Vietnam War. Laos and Cambodia also became independent in 1954, but were both drawn into the Vietnam War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vietnamese, Lao and Khmer ethnic groups formed the majority of their respective colony's populations. Minority groups such as the Muong, Tay, Chams, and Jarai, were collectively known as Montagnards and resided principally in the mountain regions of Indochina. Ethnic Han Chinese were largely concentrated in major cities, especially in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, where they became heavily involved in trade and commerce. Around 95% of French Indochina's population was rural in a 1913 estimate, although urbanisation did slowly grow over the course of French rule.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal religion in French Indochina was Buddhism, with Mahayana Buddhism influenced by Confucianism more dominant in Vietnam, while Theravda Buddhism was more widespread in Laos and Cambodia. In addition, active Catholic missionaries were widespread throughout Indochina and roughly 10% of Tonkin's population identified as Catholic by the end of French rule. Cao ?i's origins began during this period as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike Algeria, French settlement in Indochina did not occur at a grand scale. By 1940, only about 34,000 French civilians lived in French Indochina, along with a smaller number of French military personnel and government workers. The principal reasons why French settlement did not grow in a manner similar to that in French North Africa (which had a population of over 1 million French civilians) were because French Indochina was seen as a colonie d'exploitation conomique (economic colony) rather than a colonie de peuplement (settlement colony helping Metropolitan France from being overpopulated), and because Indochina was distant from France itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring French colonial rule, the French language was the principal language of education, government, trade, and media and French was widely introduced to the general population. French became widespread among urban and semi-urban populations and became the principal language of the elite and educated. This was most notable in the colonies of Tonkin and Cochinchina (Northern and Southern Vietnam respectively), where French influence was most heavy, while Annam, Laos and Cambodia were less influenced by French education.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the dominance of the French language, local populations still largely spoke their native languages. After French rule ended, the French language was still largely used among the new governments (with the exception of North Vietnam) but since then English, increasingly taught in schools across the country, has massively replaced French as the second language. Today, less than 0.5% of the population of Vietnam can speak French.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench Indochina was designated as a colonie d'exploitation (colony of economic exploitation) by the French government. Funding for the colonial government came by means of taxes on locals and the French government established a near monopoly on the trade of opium, salt and rice alcohol. The French administration established quotas of consumption for each Vietnamese village, thereby compelling villagers to purchase and consume set amounts of these monopolised goods.[15] The trade of those three products formed about 44% of the colonial government's budget in 1920 but declined to 20% by 1930 as the colony began to economically diversify.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colony's principal bank was the Banque de l'Indochine, established in 1875 and was responsible for minting the colony's currency, the Indochinese piastre. Indochina was the second most invested-in French colony by 1940 after Algeria, with investments totalling up to 6.7 million francs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the 1930s, France began to exploit the region for its natural resources and to economically diversify the colony. Cochinchina, Annam and Tonkin (encompassing modern-day Vietnam) became a source of tea, rice, coffee, pepper, coal, zinc and tin, while Cambodia became a centre for rice and pepper crops. Only Laos was seen initially as an economically unviable colony, although timber was harvested at a small scale from there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the growing automobile industry in France resulted in the growth of the rubber industry in French Indochina, and plantations were built throughout the colony, especially in Annam and Cochinchina. France soon became a leading producer of rubber through its Indochina colony and Indochinese rubber became prized in the industrialised world. The success of rubber plantations in French Indochina resulted in an increase in investment in the colony by various firms such as Michelin. With the growing number of investments in the colony's mines and rubber, tea and coffee plantations, French Indochina began to industrialise as factories opened in the colony. These new factories produced textiles, cigarettes, beer and cement which were then exported throughout the French Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen French Indochina was viewed as an economically important colony for France, the French government set a goal to improve the transport and communications networks in the colony. Saigon became a principal port in Southeast Asia and rivalled the British port of Singapore as the region's busiest commercial centre. By 1937 Saigon was the sixth busiest port in the entire French Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1936, the Trans-Indochinois railway linking Hanoi and Saigon opened. Further improvements in the colony's transport infrastructures led to easier travel between France and Indochina. By 1939, it took no more than a month by ship to travel from Marseille to Saigon and around five days by aeroplane from Paris to Saigon. Underwater telegraph cables were installed in 1921.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench settlers further added their influence on the colony by constructing buildings in the form of Beaux-Arts and added French-influenced landmarks such as the Hanoi Opera House (modeled on the Palais Garnier), the  Hanoi St. Joseph's Cathedral (resembling the Notre Dame de Paris) and the Saigon Notre-Dame Basilica. The French colonists also built a number of cities and towns in Indochina which served various purposes from trading outposts to resort towns. The most notable examples include ? L?t in southern Vietnam and Pakse in Laos.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe governments of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have previously been reluctant to promote their colonial architecture as an asset for tourism; however, in recent times, the new generation of local authorities has somewhat 'embraced' the architecture and advertise it[16].\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 210200N 1055100E? / ?21.0333N 105.8500E? / 21.0333; 105.8500","input":"When did indochina gain independence from the french?"},{"output":"an average of 178 months (roughly 15 years) between sentencing and execution","context":"Death row is a special section of a prison that houses inmates who are awaiting execution after being sentenced to death for the conviction of capital crimes. The term is also used figuratively to describe the state of awaiting execution (\\"been on death row\\"), even in places where no special facility or separate unit for condemned inmates exists. After a person is found guilty of a capital offense, the judge will give the jury the option of imposing a death sentence or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. It is then up to a jury to decide whether to give the death sentence; this usually has to be a unanimous decision. If the jury agrees on death, the defendant will remain on death row during appeal and habeas corpus procedures, which may continue for several years.\\r\\nOpponents of capital punishment claim that a prisoner's isolation and uncertainty over his or her fate constitute a form of mental cruelty and that especially long-time death row inmates are liable to become mentally ill, if they are not already. This is referred to as the death row phenomenon. In extreme cases some inmates may attempt to commit suicide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, prisoners may wait many years before execution can be carried out due to the complex and time-consuming appeals procedures mandated in the jurisdiction. The time between sentencing and execution has increased relatively steadily between 1977 and 2010, including a 22% jump between 1989 and 1990 and a similar jump between 2008 and 2009. In 2010, a death row inmate waited an average of 178 months (roughly 15 years) between sentencing and execution.[1] Nearly a quarter of inmates on death row in the U.S. die of natural causes while awaiting execution.[2]\\r\\nThere were 3,125 people on death row in the United States on January 1, 2013.[3] Since 1977, the states of Texas (464), Virginia (108) and Oklahoma (94) have executed the most death row inmates.[1] As of 2010, California (683), Florida (390), Texas (330) and Pennsylvania (218) housed more than half of all inmates pending on death row. As of 2008, the longest-serving prisoner on death row in the US who has been executed was Jack Alderman who served over 33 years. He was executed in Georgia in 2008.[4] However, Alderman only holds the distinction of being the longest-serving executed inmate so far. A Florida inmate, Gary Alvord, arrived on Florida's death row in 1974. On April 9, 2013, Alvord had been on death row for exactly 39 years when he died on May 19, 2013 from a brain tumor, having been longer on death row than any other United States inmate.[5] The oldest prisoner on death row in the United States was Leroy Nash, age 94, in Arizona. He died of natural causes on February 12, 2010.[6]\\r\\nNotes: 1Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar is the only facility in the United States Department of Defense designated to house female Level III inmates.\\r\\nWhen the United Kingdom had capital punishment, sentenced inmates were given one appeal. If that appeal was found to involve an important point of law it was taken up to the House of Lords, and if the appeal was successful, at that point the sentence was changed to life in prison.[45] The Home Secretary in the United Kingdom had the power to exercise the Sovereign's royal prerogative of mercy to grant a reprieve on execution and change the sentence to life imprisonment.\\r\\nIn some Caribbean countries that still authorize execution, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the ultimate court of appeals.

The study also provides an example of stimulus generalization. It was carried out by John B. Watson and his graduate student, Rosalie Rayner, at Johns Hopkins University. The results were first published in the February 1920 issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology.\\r\\nAfter observing children in the field, Watson hypothesized that the fearful response of children to loud noises is an innate unconditioned response. He wanted to test the notion that by following the principles of the procedure now known as \\"classical conditioning\\", he could use this unconditioned response to condition a child to fear a distinctive stimulus that normally would not be feared by a child (in this case, furry objects).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of Watson and Rayner was to condition a phobia in an emotionally stable child.[1] For this study they chose a nine-month old infant from a hospital referred to as \\"Albert\\" for the experiment.[2] Watson followed the procedures which Pavlov had used in his experiments with dogs.[3]\\r\\nBefore the experiment, Albert was given a battery of baseline emotional tests: the infant was exposed, briefly and for the first time, to a white rat, a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks (with and without hair), cotton, wool, burning newspapers, and other stimuli. Albert showed no fear of any of these items during the baseline tests.\\r\\nIn further experiments, Little Albert seemed to generalize his response to the white rat. He became distressed at the sight of several other furry objects, such as a rabbit, a furry dog, and a seal-skin coat, and even a Santa Claus mask with white cotton balls in the beard. However, this stimulus generalization did not extend to everything with hair.[4]\\r\\nFor the experiment proper, Albert was put on a mattress on a table in the middle of a room. A white laboratory rat was placed near Albert and he was allowed to play with it. At this point, Watson and Rayner made a loud sound behind Albert's back by striking a suspended steel bar with a hammer each time the baby touched the rat. Albert responded to the noise by crying and showing fear. After several such pairings of the two stimuli, Albert was presented with only the rat. Upon seeing the rat, Albert got very distressed, crying and crawling away. Apparently, the infant associated the white rat with the noise. The rat, originally a neutral stimulus, had become a conditioned stimulus, and it was eliciting an emotional response (conditioned response) similar to the distress (unconditioned response) originally given to the noise (unconditioned stimulus).[4] It should be noted that Watson's experiment had many failings by modern standards. For example, it had only a single subject and no control subjects. Furthermore, such an experiment could be hard to conduct in compliance with current law and regulations, given the expected risks to the subject.\\r\\nAlbert was about one year old at the end of the experiment, and he reportedly left the hospital shortly thereafter.[5] Though Watson had discussed what might be done to remove Albert's conditioned fears, he had no time to attempt such desensitization with Albert, and it is likely that the infant's fear of furry things continued post-experimentally.[6]\\r\\nWatson later gave a series of weekend lectures describing the Little Albert study. One of these lectures was attended by Mary Cover Jones, which sparked her interest in pursuing graduate work in psychology. She became known as the \\"Mother of Behavior Therapy\\" following a study she conducted on a three-year-old.[7]\\r\\nAccording to some textbooks, Albert's mother worked in the same building as Watson and didn't know the tests were being conducted. When she found out, she took Albert and moved away, letting no one know where they were going. A 2009 report, however, disputes that.[8] The original report had stated that the baby's mother was a wet nurse at the hospital, who may have felt coerced and unable to turn down a request for her baby to be used in Watson's experiment.\\r\\nIn 2009, psychologists Hall P. Beck and Sharman Levinson published an article in which they claimed to have discovered the true identity of \\"Albert B.\\"[9] After reviewing Watson's correspondence and publications, as well as research in public documents (such as the 1920 United States Census and state birth and death records), Beck argued that \\"Albert B.\\" was a pseudonym for Douglas Merritte, the son of Arvilla Merritte, then a woman who appears to have been a wet nurse at the Harriet Lane Home.[9] Recent research has shown, however, that Douglas Merritte may not have been \\"Little Albert\\",[10] who may in fact have been young William Barger.\\r\\nThe identity claimed by Beck, Levinson, and Irons has been contested by psychology researchers, Russ Powell and Nancy Digdon, as well as Watson scholar, Ben Harris, who offer an alternative identity based on available data.[10][11] William Barger had been born within a day of Merritte, was known by friends and family as \\"Albert\\" (even though his given name was William), and his mother had also worked at the hospital where the experiment was conducted. In addition, his size and developmental condition much more closely matched the experiment's documentation of the subject baby's condition.[12] Through the use of a professional genealogist, the researchers learned Barger had died in 2007 at age 87 and identified one close living relative, a niece. In an interview, Barger's niece stated that she and her uncle had been quite close throughout his life, acknowledged Barger's antipathy toward dogs as a well-known fact that family members would tease him about (the researchers noted there was no way to determine whether or not this behavior was linked to Watson's experiment), and stated that she did not recall any other phobias. The researchers concluded that Barger would have been unaware of his role as an infant test subject.[13]\\r\\nAlthough he probably continued to fear various furry objects for a time, Albert would likely go on to experience extinction later in life, losing the mental association between furry objects and loud noises. Nonetheless, the experiment today would be considered unethical according to the American Psychological Association's ethic code, and legislation has been passed to prevent such potentially harmful experiments.[citation needed] In the early 1970s, following widely publicized cases of research abuse, The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (NCPHS) was created to study issues surrounding the protection of humans in research.[citation needed] In 1979, the Commission issued a report entitled Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research (commonly called the Belmont Report), which provided the ethical framework on which current federal regulations for the protection of human participants in research are based.[14][15] Under the NCPHS standards set in the late 1970s, an experiment such as Watson's would not have been allowed.[16][17] There are also regulations now put in place by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Public Health Service Act, as well as required education since 2000 in the use of human research participants required by the National Institutes of Health.[citation needed]\\r\\nA detailed review of the original study and its subsequent interpretations by Ben Harris (1979)[18] stated:\\r\\nCritical reading of Watson and Rayner's (1920) report reveals little evidence either that Albert developed a rat phobia or even that animals consistently evoked his fear (or anxiety) during Watson and Rayner's experiment. It may be useful for modern learning theorists to see how the Albert study prompted subsequent research [...] but it seems time, finally, to place the Watson and Rayner data in the category of \\"interesting but uninterpretable\\" results.\\r\\nIt is difficult to be certain exactly what happened during the Little Albert Experiment since concrete evidence and scientific records are lacking. Though a film was shot during the experiment, textbooks interpret the movie differently. Various sources give contradicting accounts of events that took place, and they raise questions about exactly what stimuli were used, which stimuli the baby came to fear, and what happened to the child after the experiment. It was said that most textbooks \\"suffer from inaccuracies of various degrees\\" while referring to Watson and Rayner's study. Texts often misrepresent, exaggerate, or minimize the range of Albert's post-conditioning fears.[19]\\r\\nOther criticisms stem from the health of the child (cited as Douglas Merritte) who was not a \\"healthy,\\" \\"normal\\" infant as claimed in the study, but one who was very ill and had exhibited symptoms of hydrocephalus since birthaccording to relatives he never learned to walk or talk later in life. The child would die five years after the experiment due to complications from the congenital disease. It is stated that the study's authors were aware of the child's severe cognitive deficit, abnormal behavior, and unusually frequent crying, but continued to terrify the sick infant and generalize their findings to healthy infants, an act criticized as academic fraud.[20][21] These accusations have been challenged in another academic article which states that the child was actually William (called Albert by his family) Barger, and that the child was, in fact, healthy.[11]","input":"What was the neutral stimulus in little albert?"},{"output":"at least 7000 BC","context":"Trans-Saharan trade requires travel across the Sahara (north and south) to reach sub-Saharan Africa from the North African coast, Europe, to the Levant. While existing from prehistoric times, the peak of trade extended from the 8th century until the early 17th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sahara once had a very different environment. In Libya and Algeria, from at least 7000 BC, there was pastoralism, the hearding of sheep, goats, large settlements, and pottery. Cattle were introduced to the Central Sahara (Ahaggar) from 4000 to 3500 BC. Remarkable rock paintings (dated 3500 to 2500 BC), in places which are currently very dry, portray vegetation, and animal presence rather different from modern expectations.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a desert, Sahara is now a hostile expanse that separates the Mediterranean economy from the economy of the Niger basin. As Fernand Braudel points out that crossing such a zone (especially without mechanized transport) is worthwhile only when exceptional circumstances cause the expected gain to outweigh the cost and danger.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade, beginning around 300 CE,[citation needed] was conducted by caravans of camels.   According to Ibn Battuta, the explorer who accompanied one of the caravans, the average size per caravan was 1,000 camels; some caravans were as large as 12,000.[3][4]  The caravans would be guided by highly paid Berbers who knew the desert and could ensure safe passage from their fellow desert nomads.  The survival of a caravan was precarious and would rely on careful coordination.  Runners would be sent ahead to oases so that water could be shipped out to the caravan when it was still several days away, as the caravans could not easily carry enough with them to make the full journey. In the middle of the 14th century Ibn Battuta crossed the desert from Sijilmasa via the salt mines at Taghaza to the oasis of Oualata. A guide was sent ahead and water was brought on a journey of four days from Oualata to meet the caravan.[5] Culture and religion were also exchanged on the Trans-Saharan Trade Route. These colonies eventually adopted the language and region of the country and became absorbed into the Muslim population.[6] These colonies that were being discussed in E.W. Bovill's book were Christian captives who were brought to Africa as slaves and eventually they converted to Islam and became part of the Muslim population. Like some other people in Africa, there were some benefits of becoming part of the Muslim population. During the Muslim control of some of the Western African nations during this time there was a non-Muslim tax and many people converted so they would not have to pay that tax and also for the Christian slaves, it is against the Islamic religion to have slaves so it was one way to gain their freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient trade spanned the northeastern corner of the Sahara in the Naqadan era.  Predynastic Egyptians in the Naqada I period traded with Nubia to the south, the oases of the Western Desert to the west, and the cultures of the eastern Mediterranean to the east. Many trading routes went from oasis to oasis to resupply on both food and water. These oases were very important.[7]  They also imported obsidian from Ethiopia to shape blades and other objects.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overland route through the Wadi Hammamat from the Nile to the Red Sea was known as early as predynastic times;[9] drawings depicting Egyptian reed boats have been found along the path dating to 4000 BC.[10]  Ancient cities dating to the First Dynasty of Egypt arose along both its Nile and Red Sea junctions,[9] testifying to the route's ancient popularity.  It became a major route from Thebes to the Red Sea port of Elim, where travelers then moved on to either Asia, Arabia or the Horn of Africa.[9]  Records exist documenting knowledge of the route among Senusret I, Seti, Ramesses IV and also, later, the Roman Empire, especially for mining.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Darb el-Arbain trade route, passing through Kharga in the south and Asyut in the north, was used from as early as the Old Kingdom for the transport and trade of gold, ivory, spices, wheat, animals and plants.[12]  Later, Ancient Romans would protect the route by lining it with varied forts and small outposts, some guarding large settlements complete with cultivation.[13]  Described by Herodotus as a road \\"traversed ... in forty days\\", it became by his time an important land route facilitating trade between Nubia and Egypt,[14] and subsequently became known as the Forty Days Road.  From Kobbei, 40 kilometres (25?mi) north of al-Fashir, the route passed through the desert to Bir Natrum, another oasis and salt mine, to Wadi Howar before proceeding to Egypt.[15]  The Darb el-Arbain trade route was the easternmost of the central routes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe westernmost of the three central routes was the Ghadames Road, which ran from the Niger River at Gao north to Ghat and Ghadames before terminating at Tripoli.  Next was the easiest of the three routes: the Garamantean Road, named after the former rulers of the land it passed through and also called the Bilma Trail.  The Garamantean Road passed south of the desert near Murzuk before turning north to pass between the Alhaggar and Tibesti Mountains before reaching the oasis at Kawar.  From Kawar, caravans would pass over the great sand dunes of Bilma, where rock salt was mined in great quantities for trade, before reaching the savanna north of Lake Chad.  This was the shortest of the routes, and the primary exchanges were slaves and ivory from the south for salt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe western routes were the Walata Road, from the Sngal River, and the Taghaza Trail, from the Mali River, which had their northern termini at the great trading center of Sijilmasa, situated in Morocco just north of the desert.[15]  The growth of the city of Aoudaghost, founded in the 5th century BCE, was stimulated by its position at the southern end of a trans Saharan trade route.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the east, three ancient routes connected the south to the Mediterranean.  The herdsmen of the Fezzan of Libya, known as the Garamantes, controlled these routes as early as 1500 BC. From their capital of Germa in the Wadi Ajal, the Garamantean Empire raided north to the sea and south into the Sahel.  By the 4th century BC, the independent city-states of Phoenecia had expanded their control to the territory and routes once held by the Garamantes.[15]  Shillington states that existing contact with the Mediterranean received added incentive with the growth of the port city of Carthage. Founded c. 800 BCE, Carthage became one terminus for West African gold, ivory, and slaves. West Africa received salt, cloth, beads, and metal goods. Shillington proceeds to identify this trade route as the source for West African iron smelting.[16]  Trade continued into Roman times. Although there are Classical references to direct travel from the Mediterranean to West Africa (Daniels, p.?22f), most of this trade was conducted through middlemen, inhabiting the area and aware of passages through the drying lands.[17]  The Legio III Augusta subsequently secured these routes on behalf of Rome by the 1st century AD, safeguarding the southern border of the empire for two and half centuries.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHerodotus had spoken of the Garamantes hunting the Ethiopian Troglodytes with their chariots; this account was associated with depictions of horses drawing chariots in contemporary cave art in southern Morocco and the Fezzan, giving origin to a theory that the Garamantes, or some other Saran people, had created chariot routes to provide Rome and Carthage with gold and ivory. However, it has been argued that no horse skeletons have been found dating from this early period in the region, and chariots would have been unlikely vehicles for trading purposes due to their small capacity.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest evidence for domesticated camels in the region dates from the 3rd century.  Used by the Berber people, they enabled more regular contact across the entire width of the Sahara, but regular trade routes did not develop until the beginnings of the Islamic conversion of West Africa in the 7th and 8th centuries.[18] Two main trade routes developed.  The first ran through the western desert from modern Morocco to the Niger Bend, the second from modern Tunisia to the Lake Chad area.  These stretches were relatively short and had the essential network of occasional oases that established the routing as inexorably as pins in a map.  Further east of the Fezzan with its trade route through the valley of Kaouar to Lake Chad, Libya was impassable due to its lack of oases and fierce sandstorms.[19]  A route from the Niger Bend to Egypt was abandoned in the 10th century due to its dangers.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rise of the Ghana Empire,  now called Mali, Senegal, and  southern Mauritania, paralleled the increase in trans-Saharan trade.  Mediterranean economies were short of gold but could supply salt, taken by places like the African salt mine of Taghaza, whereas West African countries like Wangara had plenty of gold but needed salt. The trans-Saharan slave trade was also important because large numbers of Africans were sent north, generally to serve as domestic servants or slave concubines.[20] The West African states imported highly trained slave soldiers. It has been estimated that from the 10th to the 19th century some 6,000 to 7,000 slaves were transported north each year.[21] Perhaps as many as nine million slaves were exported along the trans-Saharan caravan route.[22]  Several trade routes became established, perhaps the most important terminating in Sijilmasa (Morocco) and Ifriqiya to the north. There, and in other North African cities, Berber traders had increased contact with Islam, encouraging conversions, and by the 8th century, Muslims were traveling to Ghana. Many in Ghana converted to Islam, and it is likely that the Empire's trade was privileged as a result. Around 1050, Ghana lost  Aoudaghost to the Almoravids, but new goldmines around Bure reduced trade through the city, instead benefiting the Malinke of the south, who later founded the Mali Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike  Ghana, Mali was a Muslim kingdom since his foundation, and under it, the goldÿsalt trade continued.  Other, less important trade goods were slaves, kola nuts from the south and slave beads and cowry shells from the north (for use as currency).  It was under Mali that the great cities of the Niger bendincluding Gao and DjennȨprospered, with Timbuktu in particular becoming known across Europe for its great wealth. Important trading centers in southern West Africa developed at the transitional zone between the forest and the savanna; examples include Begho and Bono Manso (in present-day Ghana) and Bondoukou (in present-day C?te d'Ivoire). Western trade routes continued to be important, with Ouadane, Oualata and Chinguetti being the major trade centres in what is now Mauritania, while the Tuareg towns of Assod and later Agadez grew around a more easterly route in what is now Niger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eastern trans-Saharan route led to the development of the long lived Kanem-Bornu empire as well as the Ghana, Mali, and Songhai empires, centred on the Lake Chad area.  This trade route was somewhat less efficient and only rose to great prominence when there was turmoil in the west such as during the Almohad conquests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Portuguese journeys around the West African coast opened up new avenues for trade between Europe and West Africa. By the early 16th century, European trading bases, the \\"Factories\\" established on the coast since 1445, and trade with the wealthier Europeans became of prime importance to West Africa. North Africa had declined in both political and economic importance, while the Saharan crossing remained long and treacherous. However, the major blow to trans-Saharan trade was the Battle of Tondibi of 1591ÿ92. Morocco sent troops across the Sahara and attacked Timbuktu, Gao and some other important trading centres, destroying buildings and property and exiling prominent citizens. This disruption to trade led to a dramatic decline in the importance of these cities and the resulting animosity reduced trade considerably.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough much reduced, trans-Saharan trade continued. But trade routes to the West African coast became increasingly easy, particularly after the French invasion of the Sahel in the 1890s and subsequent construction of railways to the interior. A railway line from Dakar to Algiers via the Niger bend was planned but never constructed.  With the independence of nations in the region in the 1960s, the northÿsouth routes were severed by national boundaries.  National governments were hostile to Tuareg nationalism and so made few efforts to maintain or support trans-Saharan trade, and the Tuareg Rebellion of the 1990s and Algerian Civil War further disrupted routes, with many roads closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional caravan routes are largely void of camels, but the shorter Azalai routes from Agadez to Bilma and Timbuktu to Taoudenni are still regularlyif lightlyused. Some members of the Tuareg still use the traditional trade routes, often traveling 2,400?km (1,500?mi) and six months out of every year by camel across the Sahara trading in salt carried from the desert interior to communities on the desert edges.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe African Union and African Development Bank support the Trans-Sahara Highway from Algiers to Lagos via Tamanrasset which aims to stimulate trans-Saharan trade. The route is paved except for a 200?km section in northern Niger, but border restrictions still hamper traffic. Only a few trucks carry trans-Saharan trade, particularly fuel and salt. Three other highways across the Sahara are proposed: for further details see Trans-African Highways. Building the highways is difficult because of sandstorms.","input":"When did the trans saharan trade routes begin?"},{"output":"Aimee Semple McPherson","context":"The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel (ICFG), commonly referred to as the Foursquare Church, is an evangelical Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1923 by preacher Aimee Semple McPherson. As of 2000, it had a worldwide membership of over 8,000,000, with almost 60,000 churches in 144 countries. The headquarters is in Los Angeles, California, United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1922, Aimee Semple McPherson (1890ÿ1944), an evangelist known as \\"Sister Aimee\\", explains for the first time its definition of the term Foursquare Gospel (theological concept \\"Full Gospel\\"). [1] According to chapter 1 of Book of Ezekiel, Ezekiel had a vision of God as revealed to be four different aspects: a man, a lion, an ox and an eagle. It also represents the four aspects of the Department of Christ; Savior, Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, Healer and Soon-coming King. This will be the vision and the name that she will give at Foursquare Church, founded in 1923 to Los Angeles.[2] Los Angeles was her center of operations, and Angelus Temple, seating 5,300 people, was opened in Echo Park in 1923.[3] The attendance has become a megachurch with 10 000 people. [4] McPherson was a flamboyant celebrity in her day, participating in publicity events, such as weekly Sunday parades through the streets of Los Angeles, along with the mayor and movie stars, directly to Angelus Temple. She built the temple, as well as what is now known as Life Pacific College adjacent to it, on the northwest corner of land that she owned in the middle of the city.\\r\\nMcPherson's celebrity status continued after her death, with biopics such as the 1976 Hallmark Hall of Fame drama The Disappearance of Aimee depicting her life, as well as the 2006 independent film Aimee Semple McPherson, which particularly focused on her month-long disappearance in MayÿJune 1926 and the legal controversy that followed.[5][6][7]\\r\\nAfter Aimee Semple McPherson's death in 1944, her son Rolf K. McPherson became president and leader of the church, a position he held for 44 years.[8] [9] The Foursquare Church formed the \\"Pentecostal Fellowship of North America\\" in 1948 in Des Moines, Iowa, in an alliance with the Assemblies of God, the Church of God, the Open Bible Standard Churches, the Pentecostal Holiness Church, and others. In 1994, 46 years after the founding of the Pentecostal Fellowship, it was reorganized as the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America after combining with African-American organizations, most significantly the Church of God in Christ.\\r\\nOn May 31, 1988, John R.

The church teaches that salvation is by grace through faith and not by good works.[20] Believers are justified by faith and born again upon repentance and acceptance of Christ as Lord and king.[21] Consistent with its belief in human free will, the Foursquare Church also teaches that it is possible for a believer to backslide or commit apostasy.[22]\\r\\nThe Foursquare Church teaches that sanctification is a continual process of spiritual growth.[23] Christian perfection and holiness can be attained through surrender and consecration to God. This spiritual growth is believed to be promoted by Bible study and prayer.[24] The Foursquare Church believes in the baptism with the Holy Spirit as an event separate from conversion that empowers the individual and the wider church to fulfill the church's mission of evangelization. The Foursquare Church expects Spirit baptism to be received in the same manner as recorded in the Book of Acts, namely that the believer will receive spiritual gifts, possibly (though not necessarily) including speaking in tongues.[25] The evidence of the Spirit-filled life is the Fruit of the Spirit. The church believes that spiritual gifts continue in operation for the edification of the church.[26]\\r\\nThe Foursquare Church believes that divine healing is a part of Christs atonement. It teaches that the sick can be healed in response to prayer.[27] The Foursquare Church anticipates a premillennial return of Christ to earth.[28] It believes that there will be a future final judgment where the righteous will receive everlasting life and the wicked everlasting punishment. The Foursquare Church observes believer's baptism by immersion and the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion as ordinances.[29] Open communion is practiced.[30] Anointing of the sick and tithing are practiced as well.[31]\\r\\nThe Foursquare Convention is the chief decision making body of the Foursquare Church. Meeting regularly every year, the convention's voting membership includes international officers and licensed ministers. Each Foursquare church located in the United States has the right to send one voting delegate per every 50 church members.[32] National Foursquare Churches outside of the United States may send one official delegate to the convention.[33]\\r\\nA board of 12 to 20 directors manages the Foursquare Church. In addition to overseeing the Church's activities, the board of directors appoints officers and is responsible for licensing and ordaining ministers. Members of the board include the president, vice presidents, and at least nine ministers representing geographic regions. Church members in good standing may also be appointed to the board.[34]\\r\\nLocal Foursquare churches are subordinate parts of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel and are operated according to the bylaws of the international church. There are two categories of Foursquare churches.[35] A \\"charter member church\\" is a member church that has no legal existence apart from the international church and whose property is owned by the international church. The second category is \\"covenant member church\\", which include \\"pioneer churches\\" and previously non-member churches. Pioneer churches are recently established church plants that have not been upgraded to charter member status. Covenant member churches might also be previously non-member churches that join the Foursquare Church but choose not to transfer their real property to the international church.[36]\\r\\nNon-member churches may choose to affiliate with the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel without becoming a full member of the international church. These \\"community member churches\\" retain their separate legal identities and autonomy. They are not under the control or authority of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, and they license or ordain their own ministers. Community member churches affiliate with the Foursquare Church \\"on a relational basis of shared principles, endeavors, goals and purpose\\". This relationship between the international church and the community member church can be terminated by either party with or without cause.[37] Members of community member churches are not members of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel.[38]\\r\\nIn the United States, the church is divided into districts, divisions, and individual churches. A General Supervisor oversees the national office and district supervisors; district supervisors oversee divisional superintendents who have oversight of individual churches within the local region. Rev. Tammy Dunahoo currently (2014) serves as General Supervisor.\\r\\nTwo colleges are affiliated with the Foursquare Church. These are: Life Pacific College, formerly \\"L. I. F. E. Bible College,\\" in San Dimas, California, and Pacific Life Bible College in Surrey, British Columbia.\\r\\nThe update in the 2008 Foursquare Church Annual Report provides 2007 data of the movement's statistics in the United States, as of April 1, 2008:\\r\\nOver 30 churches from Louisiana and Mississippi are said to be formalizing into the Foursquare Church as of October, 2010.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2006, membership in the United States was 353,995 in 1,875 churches.[39] While congregations are concentrated along the West Coast, the denomination is well distributed across the United States.[40] The states with the highest membership rates are Oregon, Hawaii, Montana, Washington, and California.[40]\\r\\nIn Canada, Anna D. Britton, a graduate of L.I.F.E. Bible College in Los Angeles, moved to Vancouver, B.C. in 1927, established L.I.F.E. Bible College of Canada in 1928 and grew a small group of believers into a congregation of nearly 1,000, known as Kingsway Foursquare Church. Her vision prompted her to extend the Foursquare Gospel to the three western provinces of Canada over which she served as Supervisor for many years. Other Supervisors of the Western Canada District have been, B.A. McKeown, Clarence Hall, Warren Johnson, Guy Duffield, Charles Baldwin, Harold Wood, Roy Hicks Sr., and John Holland.\\r\\nVictor Gardner became Supervisor of the Western Canada District in 1974. Eventually, in order to comply with Canadian law, The Western Canada District needed to register all properties in the name of a Canadian Corporation and gain control of all finances as well. Victor Gardner led the development of the Constitution and Bylaws, the Administrative Manual and oversaw the transfer of all the legal documents so on March 5, 1981, the Foursquare Gospel Church of Canada (FGCC) came into being.[41][not in citation given]\\r\\nTim Peterson was President of the FGCC from 1992ÿ2007. His wife, Laurene, also worked in the National Office of FGCC, and together they oversaw the establishment of a healthy corporate structure and developed National Teams.\\r\\nBarry Buzza, who planted the largest Foursquare Church in Canada, Northside Church, a three-campus church in the Tri-Cities (Coquitlam, and two in Port Coquitlam) in the Vancouver metropolitan area of British Columbia was elected as President on July 1, 2007. His inauguration took place at the FGCC Convention on Thursday, October 25, 2007 at the Chandos Pattison Auditorium in Surrey, British Columbia.\\r\\nSteve Falkiner was appointed President in 2012 and currently serves in this role.\\r\\nThe church has a major presence in Nigeria. It entered Nigeria in 1955 through the ministry of Rev. & Mrs Harold Curtis who established the LIFE Theological Seminary at Herbert Macurley Road, Yaba, Lagos.[citation needed] The missionary couples trained a group of young boys and taught them the doctrines of Foursquare as contained in the 22 tenets of faith of the movement.[citation needed] Today, the church is the second largest in Nigeria. The church is currently headed by Rev. Felix Meduoye in Nigeria. The headquarter of Foursquare Gospel Church In Nigeria is at 62/66 Akinwunmi Street, Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria. The church has an international conference center at Orinsunmibare Idimu, Lagos.[42]","input":"Who is the founder of four square gospel church?"},{"output":"16 teams","context":"The Little League Baseball World Series is an annual baseball tournament in the eastern United States for children aged 11 to 13 years old. [1] Originally called the National Little League Tournament, it was later renamed for the World Series in Major League Baseball. The Series was first held 70 years ago in 1947 and is held every August in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania.[2] (Although the postal address of the organization is in Williamsport, the Series itself is played at Howard J. Lamade Stadium and Volunteer Stadium at the Little League headquarters complex in South Williamsport.)\\r\\nInitially, only teams from the US competed in the Series but it has since become a worldwide tournament. The tournament has gained popular renown, especially in the United States, where games from the Series and even from regional tournaments are broadcast on ESPN. In 2006, the age limit was changed to include players who turn 13 after April 30 of the same year, rather than after July 31, as had previously been the case. As the Series takes place in August, many of the players will have already turned 13 before the Series starts. In 2014 Little League originally voted to change the age cut off from April 30th to December 31st. However, this caused outrage by parents because the players born between May 1 and August 31, 2005 would have lost their 12 year old season because they would be considered to be 13 years old even though they have not reached their 13th birthday. Effective November, 2015, a new implementation plan was established, which \\"grandfathers\\" players born between May 1 and August 31, 2005 as 12-year-olds for the 2018 seasons, using the current April 30 age determination date for the 2018 season. Beginning with 2019, a new determination date of August 31 will be used, which will ban 13 year old players from participating in the Series. Thus, players would have to have their 13th birthday after August 31st.\\r\\nWhile the Little League Baseball World Series is frequently referred to as just the Little League World Series, it is actually one of twelve tournaments sponsored by Little League International, in twelve different locations. Each of them brings community teams from different Little League International regions around the world together in baseball (five age divisions), girls' softball (four age divisions), and boys' softball (three divisions). The tournament structure described here is that used for the Little League Baseball World Series. The structure used for the other World Series is similar, but with different regions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer months leading up to the Little League World Series, held each year in August, Little Leagues around the world select an All-Star team made up of players from its league. It is these All-Star teams that compete in district,[3] sectional and/or divisional, and regional tournaments,[citation needed] hoping to advance to Williamsport for the Little League World Series. How many games a team has to play varies from region to region. In the United States, the tournaments at the lowest (district) level lack nationwide standardization. Some use pool play or double elimination, while others use single elimination.\\r\\nIn the United States, the fate of district winners varies widely from state to state. In some larger states such as Pennsylvania, New York, and California, the district winners advance to one of many sectional tournaments.[3] The winners of each sectional tournament then advance to a state or divisional tournament, the latter only being held in Texas and California and are similar to the state tournaments held in less densely populated states.[3] Most smaller states lack competition at the sectional level and go straight from district to state tournaments. A handful of states are composed of only one district, and the district champion is the automatic state champion.[3]\\r\\nWith 4 exceptions, every state as well as the District of Columbia crowns a state champion,[4] and sends that team to represent it to one of eight regional tournaments. The exceptions involve California, Texas, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Because of their large geographic and population sizes, California and Texas send two representatives to their regional tournament; Northern California and Southern California in the West region tournament and Texas East and Texas West (whose areas encompass more than the geographical areas of East Texas and West Texas, splitting roughly along the I-35/I-37 corridor) compete in the Southwest region tournament.[3] Conversely, North Dakota has only one city (Fargo) that operates Little Leagueÿsponsored competitions; the Dakotas have one district spanning the two states, and its winner becomes the joint champion and advances to the Midwest region tournament.[3]\\r\\nThe state champions (as well as the Northern California, Southern California, Texas East, Texas West, and Dakotas champions) compete in one of eight different regional tournaments. Each regional tournament winner then advances to the Little League World Series. See [4] for a comprehensive breakdown of current and historical US regional tournament locations, participants and results.\\r\\nOther countries and regions pick their own way of crowning a champion.[3] Little League Canada holds tournaments at the provincial and divisional level to field six champions (five provincial and one divisional) at the national tournament: Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and the Atlantic Provinces.[5] The host site of the national tournament varies from year to year, and the host team gets an automatic berth as the seventh team. The tournament is played as a round robin and uses the page playoff format. The winner of the national tournament earns the right to represent Canada at the Little League World Series.\\r\\nThe Little League World Series consists of 16 teamsÿ8 from the United States, and 8 from other countries. Prior to 2001 there were eight teams in the LLWS: four U.S. teams (Central, South, East, and West) and four international (Canada, Latin America, Europe, and the Far East). It should be noted that in 1975 there were only four teams in the LLWS, all from the United States.[6] The international teams returned in 1976.[6] Starting in 1976, two brackets were established, with the four U.S. regions competing in the U.S. bracket and the four non-U.S. regions competing in the International bracket. The U.S. national champion and the International champion then compete for the World Series title.[6]\\r\\nIn 2001, the number of regions was doubled to 16, from which the 16 regional champions continued to be divided into the two brackets: 8 in the United States Bracket and 8 in the International Bracket. From 2001 to 2009, however, each team was then randomly assigned to one of two \\"pools\\" in their respective bracket. In the opening days of the tournament, the teams competed round-robin within their own pool. The top two teams in each pool advanced to the semifinal of their bracket, where the first place team from one pool competed against the second place team from the other. The respective winners advanced to play in either the United States or International Final. The U.S. champion and the International champion advanced to compete in the Little League World Series Championship Game.\\r\\nOn April 14, 2010, Little League announced that starting in 2010, round robin play would be replaced by a double-elimination bracket in each pool. The winners of each pool would advance to single elimination US and International Championship games, and the winners of those games would advance to the World Championship game. Every team would play a minimum of three games: the four teams that lost their first two games would cross over and play U.S. vs. International games.[7]\\r\\nOn June 16, 2011, it was announced that the double-elimination format had been modified. The pools were eliminated, with the eight U.S. teams continuing to compete in one bracket and the eight International teams in another bracket. The tournament remains double-elimination until the U.S. and International Championship games, where it becomes single-elimination. (That is, if the team that advances through the winner's bracket loses the championship game they are eliminated and the teams do not play a rubber game.) Each team still plays a minimum of three games, playing a \\"crossover\\" (U.S. vs. International) consolation game if eliminated after their second game.[8][9]\\r\\nThe eight regional tournament winners which compete in the United States Bracket of the Little League World Series, as well as the states those regional champions could possibly hail from are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eight divisions which compete in the International Bracket are as follows:\\r\\nThe eight divisions which compete in the United States bracket represent 96% of the players in Little League with over 2.2 million players while the eight divisions in the International bracket represent 4% of the Little League or less than 130 thousand players.\\r\\nPrior to 2008, instead of two separate geographic regions, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa held two coterminous regions:[10]\\r\\nThe Transatlantic and EMEA regions were geographically identical. Leagues from the Transatlantic region generally consisted of children and other dependents of American expatriates, typically Armed Forces personnel, international organization members, and oil company workers (such as the team representing the Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran, which advanced to the World Series 19 times through 2007, including all the tournaments from 2001 through 2007). The leagues within the \\"EMEA\\" region consisted of players native to the league's own country. Representative teams for the Trans-Atlantic region had to have at least 51% nationals of Canada, the U.S. or Japan, while teams for the EMEA region could have no more than three players from those three countries.\\r\\nTeams in the reorganized Europe and MEA regions did not have nationality restrictions, as evidenced by the 2009 series. In that year, both regions were won by teams made up primarily of children of American expatriates. Europe was represented by a team from Ramstein Air Base, a United States Air Force base in Germany, while MEA was represented for the second time in its two-year existence by the team from the Saudi Aramco camp.\\r\\nOn August 29, 2012, Little League announced a significant realignment of the international regions, which took effect in 2013:[11]\\r\\nTwo venues host World Series games: Howard J. Lamade Stadium and Little League Volunteer Stadium. Lamade Stadium has hosted games since 1959, and added lights in 1992.[12] Volunteer Stadium opened in 2001 when the field expanded to 16 teams. Prior to 1959, the Little League World Series was held at Original Little League on West Fourth Street in Williamsport.[13]\\r\\nBoth fields have symmetrical fences, with a distance of 68.6 m (225?feet) from home plate to each of the outfield positions. That distance had been 62.5 m (205?feet) before 2006.\\r\\nAdmission to all LLWS games is free for all spectators. However, stadium seats for the championship game are distributed in a random drawing of all interested parties due to high demand. Some early round games, mostly games with Pennsylvania teams, will use first-come, first-served admission if a big crowd is to be expected.[14] Lamade Stadium has a berm beyond the fences that has allowed the facility to hold up to 45,000 spectators.\\r\\nThe first broadcast of the Little League World Series on television was on ABC Sports (now ESPN on ABC) in 1963. For years, only the championship game was televised. Since the late 1980s, when the tournament was reorganized, both the U.S. and international championships, the \\"semifinals\\", have been shown. As the years passed, more telecasts were added on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2. In 2006, 28 of the 36 games were televised on the three networks.\\r\\nThe 2006 world championship game was to be the last telecast on ABC Sports before ESPN's complete takeover of the sports division and name change. However, the final was postponed one day because of rain and was shown by ESPN2.\\r\\nIn January 2007, it was announced that ESPN, ESPN2, and ABC had extended their contract with the Little League organization through 2014.[21] That year, every game of the LLWS was scheduled to be televised for the first time, with all but one game live on ESPN, ESPN2, or ABC. (The other game was to be available online at ESPN360, then shown on ESPN2 the next day.)[22] In addition, a number of games were to be shown in high-definition on ESPN, ESPN2, and ABC. The championship games in all other divisions, as well as the semifinals and finals of the Little League Softball World Series, was scheduled for either ESPN, ESPN2 or ESPNU.\\r\\nIn June 2011, it was announced that ESPN would add 17 games to its schedule on ESPN 3D.[23]\\r\\nCoverage of the qualifying games has increased in the US recently: as of 2014, all regional group games (with the exception of the Southwest and New England regions) are streamed online via the ESPN3 platform, with the semifinals joining the finals on an ESPN network. The aforementioned Southwest and New England regional games are aired in full on the Longhorn Network (itself owned by ESPN) and NESN, respectively. The increased level of participation, competition, and publicity of the Little League World Series in recent years has established a trend in the opposite direction of most other preteen sports.\\r\\nMost LLWS games are broadcast live on local radio station WRAK 1400AM, which is owned by Clear Channel. The radio broadcasts are also streamed online at the LLWS page at littleleague.org.\\r\\nEach of the other eleven divisions of Little League Baseball has its own World Series format (including three in boys' softball).\\r\\nCoordinates: 4114N 7659W? / ?41.23N 76.98W? / 41.23; -76.98","input":"How many little league teams make it to williamsport?"},{"output":"20ÿ134","context":"Listed below are the Major League Baseball teams with the worst season won-lost records, as determined by winning percentage (.300 or less), minimum 120 games played.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following teams finished the season with a .300 winning percentage or lower.\\r\\nThe 1899 Cleveland Spiders own the worst single-season record of all time (minimum 120 games) and for all eras, finishing at 20ÿ134 (.130 percentage) in the final year of the National League's 12-team era in the 1890s; for comparison, this projects to 21ÿ141 under the current 162-game schedule, and Pythagorean expectation based on the Spiders' results and the current 162-game schedule predicts a record of 25ÿ137.\\r\\nThe Spiders had a fair amount of success in the 1890s, with seven straight winning seasons from 1892 to 1898 and a Temple Cup victory in 1895. Meanwhile, the once four-time American Association champion St. Louis Browns had fallen to 29ÿ102 in 1897 and to 39ÿ111 (including 19ÿ67 on the road) in 1898. But the Spiders ownership, the Robison brothers, bought the Browns in time for the 1899 season, creating a conflict-of-interest situation which was later outlawed. On the eve of the season, they traded almost all of Cleveland's good players to St. Louis for very little in return, with respectable results for St. Louis and disastrous results for Cleveland.\\r\\nThe 1899 Spiders set the major league record for most consecutive losses in a season (24, from July 26 to September 16), and had six losing streaks of 10 games or more. The Spiders lost 40 of their last 41 games, finishing 84 games behind the 1899 National League champion Brooklyn Dodgers and 35 games behind the second-last-placed Washington Senators. They lost 27 games in September, a record for the most games lost in a month until the 1909 Washington Senators went 5ÿ29 in July. Due to paltry attendances, the Spiders played 112 games on the road, finishing with a road record of 11ÿ101 (the 101 road losses is a record which is unbreakable under the current MLB scheduling rules, which allow a maximum of 81 road games).\\r\\nThe 1899 Browns, renamed the \\"Perfectos\\" and staffed with all the best players from the 1898 Spiders (six of the Spiders' eight starting position players and four starting pitchers, including the great Cy Young) improved by 44? games, from 39ÿ111 to 84ÿ67. However, all St. Louis did ultimately was to trade places with Cleveland in the standings. The Browns/Perfectos were renamed the St. Louis Cardinals in 1900, and are unrelated to the American League St. Louis Browns that adopted the discarded nickname and also appear on this list.\\r\\nAfter the 1899 season, the National League contracted from twelve to eight clubs for the 1900 season, with the Spiders, the original Baltimore Orioles, Louisville Colonels (Louisville has never had another major league team since), and the original Washington Senators folding operations. Baltimore had also been stripped of its best players by Brooklyn in 1899, to somewhat less dramatic effect, but still enough to speed their demise. The smaller 1900 National League allowed the Western League to fulfill its dreams of becoming a major league, filling the void in a number of cities by renaming itself the American League in 1900 and declaring itself a major league in 1901.\\r\\nWith shorter schedules before 1886, it was much more common for teams to finish with sub-.300 winning percentages, as there was less of the evening out effect of a longer season.\\r\\nFour teams have finished with worse overall winning percentages than the 1899 Spiders, but these teams played less than 50 games during their seasons, and in leagues whose status as \\"major\\" is questionable.\\r\\nThree of these occurred in the National Association (the status of the National Association as a major league has long been disputed):\\r\\nThe Wilmington Quicksteps of the 1884 Union Association played only 18 games, finishing with a 2ÿ16 record (.111 percentage) before they dropped out of the Association and folded. For comparison, this projects to 18ÿ144 under the current schedule, and Pythagorean expectation based on the Quicksteps' results and the current 162-game schedule predicts a record of 14ÿ148. However, while the Union Association is conventionally listed as a major league, this status has been questioned due to the league's overall lack of playing talent and poor organizational structure.\\r\\nContemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league, with the earliest record referencing the Union Association as a major league dating to 1922.[1]\\r\\nThe 1890 Alleghenys were gutted before the season when nearly all of their best players defected to the Pittsburgh Burghers of the Players' League. Poor attendances meant that they played 97 of their 136 games on the road, finishing with a road record of 9ÿ88 (the 88 road losses remained a record until 1899, and is unreachable under current MLB scheduling rules). The Alleghenys .093 road winning percentage is the lowest in MLB history for a minimum of 60 games.\\r\\nThe Philadelphia Athletics were a good team in the early 1910s, winning American League pennants in 1913 and 1914 and the World Series in 1913. However, owner-manager Connie Mack felt that he was unable to pay his star players' salaries while the Federal League was in operation, and he sold or traded most of them after the 1914 World Series ended. The Athletics then finished in last place from 1915ÿ1922. In 1916, they went 36ÿ117, including 13ÿ64 on the road. The 1916 Athletics .235 winning percentage is the sixth-lowest of any MLB team and the lowest since 1900.\\r\\nThe 1935 Boston Braves featured Hall of Famers Rabbit Maranville (age 43) and Babe Ruth (age 40). Braves owner Emil Fuchs had promised Ruth an ownership stake in the Braves and a chance to manage the club in the near future, but had little intention of delivering either. Ruth retired on June 1, 1935, having hit .181 in 72 at-bats for the Braves, with six home runs (the last three all coming on the same day, May 25, 1935, at Pittsburgh). Fuchs, who had been plagued by financial problems for a decade, was forced to give up control of the Braves before the end of the season. The Braves' home winning percentage of .167 is the fifth-lowest of any MLB team and the lowest since 1900.\\r\\nThe 1939 Browns drew 386 fans to the park for a 7ÿ4 home loss to Detroit on September 27.[2]\\r\\nThe 1962 New York Mets were an expansion team created to fill the void after the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers left New York City at end of the 1957 season. The Mets, filled with castoffs like \\"Marvelous\\" Marv Throneberry as well as aging Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn and low-talent rookies such as Choo-Choo Coleman, finished with the third-worst winning percentage in the modern era and the modern-era record for most losses. The Mets went on to finish last or next-to-last for seven years in a row, before they shocked the baseball world by winning the 1969 World Series.\\r\\nThe 2003 Tigers seemed like a sure bet to break the 1962 Mets' modern record for most losses when they stood at 38ÿ118 after 156 games, but they won five of their last six to avoid ignominy. On September 27, in their penultimate game, the Tigers came back from an 8ÿ0 deficit to beat the Minnesota Twins 9ÿ8 (the Twins, having just clinched the division, were resting their starters).[3] When the Tigers won the season finale to avoid tying the record, they received a standing ovation from the crowd. Mike Maroth, a starting pitcher for the 2003 Detroit Tigers, went 9ÿ21 and became the first pitcher to lose 20 games in a season since Brian Kingman dropped 20 games for the 1980 Oakland Athletics.[4] Ram܇n Santiago of the Tigers became only the 12th Triple Crown loser (a player who finishes last in all of the three Triple Crown categories) in modern MLB history.[5] One baseball statistician described the Tigers as possibly \\"the worst team of all time without a good excuse\\", as virtually every other team on the list had been reduced to minor-league status, plagued by financial problems or was a first-year expansion team.[6]\\r\\nThree years after losing 119 games, the Detroit Tigers went 95ÿ67 and won their 10th American League pennant, before losing the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. Players common to the 2003 and 2006 Tigers teams included Brandon Inge, Ram܇n Santiago (who spent 2004 and 2005 with the Seattle Mariners), Craig Monroe, Dmitri Young (released in September 2006), Omar Infante, Mike Maroth, Jeremy Bonderman, Nate Robertson, Jamie Walker, Wilfredo Ledezma, and Fernando Rodney.","input":"What is the worst season record in mlb history?"},{"output":"a list of rules to get over a former boyfriend","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"New Rules\\" is a song by English singer Dua Lipa from her eponymous debut studio album (2017). The track was written and produced by Ian Kirkpatrick, with an additional writing from Caroline Ailin and Emily Warren. It was released to contemporary hit radio in the United Kingdom on 15 July 2017 as the album's sixth single. It impacted the same format in the United States on 22 August.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"New Rules\\" is a tropical house, EDM and electropop song with a drum and horn instrumentation. In the lyrics, the singer states a list of rules to get over a former boyfriend. It has received positive reviews from music critics, with many of them labelling it as a break-up and female empowerment anthem. It reached number one in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium (Flanders), Ireland, Israel and Romania, while peaking within the top ten in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and several other countries. \\"New Rules\\" became the singer's third entry and first top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number six.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accompanying music video for the song was directed by Henry Scholfield and premiered through Lipa's YouTube account on 7 July 2017. It shows the artist staying in a hotel room with her friends, who prevent her from getting back together with her former boyfriend. The visual gained the attention of many music critics, who commended its themes of female empowerment. It was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Choreography at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.[1] The track's commercial success has been attributed to the popularity of the music video. Lipa has performed \\"New Rules\\" during awards ceremonies such as the BBC Radio 1 Teen Awards and the 2018 Brit Awards, and also included it on the set list of her tour, The Self-Titled Tour (2017ÿ18).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"New Rules\\" was written by Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren and its producer Ian Kirkpatrick during a writing camp for British band Little Mix.[2][3] Kirkpatrick also engineered and programmed the track, while Chris Gehringer mastered it and Josh Gudwin mixed it.[4] \\r\\nAccording to Warren, she was told in the early years of her career to never write a song where the male partner will not \\"get it\\", but later stopped following that because she thinks the \\"best writing\\" happens when she stops worrying about what to do and just expresses herself. She added that she applied this approach with \\"New Rules\\", whose lyrics were inspired by Ailin's struggles with the temptation of getting back together with a former boyfriend.[5] The song was passed down by a few artists, including one who thought it did not have a notable hook.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2017, Lipa announced through her Facebook account that she was postponing the release of her eponymous debut studio album to 2 June of that year in order to record more songs.[7] After this, she traveled to Los Angeles, California, where Kirkpatrick played her \\"New Rules\\" and she recorded it.[8] When asked about the fact that she did not write the song after saying in past interviews that she preferred to write her own music, Lipa stated that her perspective had changed and that:\\r\\n\\r\\nI still take a lot of pride in being able to write my own songs. My story's coming from me. But 'New Rules' is a song that I felt like I had been in the room and written. I'm so close with Emily [Warren] and Caroline [Ailin] and Ian [Kirkpatrick], who had worked on it, that I feel like it was a song they had written with me in mind. I'm proud of it as if I had been in that room. I just feel so closely to it. I guess I don't have that perspective anymore. But like I said, I still love writing everything. And I'm still going to do it. But it's a song that I feel like I can relate to on a personal level, that I also feel that when I do perform it, it becomes mine and I embody it in a different way.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"New Rules\\" has been described as a tropical house, EDM,[9] and electropop song[10] with elements of bashment, featuring a drum and horn instrumentation.[11] According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, the song is composed in the key of A minor, and has a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Lipa's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5.[12] In the lyrics, the singer sets a list of rules that prevent her from getting back together with an ex-boyfriend. The rules are: \\"One: Don't pick up the phone, you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone / Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again / Three: Don't be his friend, you know you're going to wake up in his bed in the morning.\\" [13] Lipa confessed in an interview with NPR that \\"[t]hey're not necessarily rules I've been able to stick by. But [they're] rules that I feel like it's important to be able to tell yourself, to tell your friends... There's a reason people break up, and it's probably the same reason why you shouldn't get back together.\\"[14] Warren explained through an annotation on website Genius that the track was a self-reminder for people recovering from a break-up to not succumb to a momentary temptation since it is not \\"a good idea in the long term\\".[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nTalking about the song, the artist explained that \\"'New Rules' is quite different to a lot of tracks on the album.

Yeung called it a \\"house-inflected shine\\" in which Lipa makes \\"a cautionary list\\".[22] Writing for Clash, Alex Green felt tracks like \\"New Rules\\" demonstrate \\"exactly why critics picked Lipa out as one to watch [the previous year].\\"[11] Dayna Evans of The Cut labeled it a \\"breakup anthem\\",[23] while Melinda Newman of Billboard considered it a \\"female-empowerment anthem\\".[16] Anjali Raguraman of The Straits Times also called the song a \\"breakup anthem\\" and an \\"addictive, horn-laced pop tune\\", adding that, \\"The track, with its slick production and stellar vocals, oozes self-confidence and sass.\\"[13] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH stated that the song had themes of \\"assertiveness and outright feminine power\\" and that it felt more convincing than \\"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\\" (2016).[24] Beat Media's Ryan Cole commended the recording's lyrics, and considered the production its \\"most distinctive element\\".[25] James Barker of The Edge wrote that Dua Lipa starts to \\"wind down [...] with the dizzying synth for 'New Rules'\\".[26] Rachael Scarsbrook of Renowned for Sound opined that \\"'New Rules' and 'Begging' make sure the upbeat melodies continue long into the final moments of Lipa's record, the album may almost be over but the party is just beginning.\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nLarisha Paul of Baeble Music deemed it as an \\"absolute banger\\" and a \\"timeless song\\".[28] On his review of the album, Sebas E. Alonso of Spanish website Jenesaispop noted that \\"New Rules\\" had influences of the music of the 1990s.[29] Alonso further included the track on his list of the best songs of 2017, calling it a \\"summer hit\\".[30] Hannah J Davies of The Guardian stated that it was \\"infused with EDM and tropical house without sounding too consciously trend-chasing\\",[9] while Luke Holland of the same publication called it the track of the week and praised the lyrical content, though he further stated that \\"disposable pop is now actually this good\\".[31] In a more negative review, DIY's Alim Kheraj stated that the song \\"is a flat tropically-tinged empowerment track that already sounds dated.\\"[32] Billboard editor Patrick Crowley ranked it at number four on his list of the best gay anthems of 2017,[33] while Raisa Bruner of Time selected it as the best song of the year, writing that, \\"'New Rules' works so well because it's both stylish and layered: As an escapist fantasy of girl-power, it's a triumph, but as a rallying cry to buck the status quo, it's even better.\\"[34] Other publications that included the track among their lists of the best songs of 2017 were Entertainment Weekly,[35] Esquire,[36] and The New York Times.[37] \\"New Rules\\" won the Best Single Award at the BBC Radio 1 Teen Awards in 2017.[38] It was also nominated for the British Single accolade at the 2018 Brit Awards, but lost to \\"Human\\" by Rag'n'Bone Man.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe track's commercial success has been attributed to the popularity of its music video.[19][47][48] In the United Kingdom, \\"New Rules\\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 75, on the issue dated 14 July 2017.[49] On the week of 4 August, it reached the ninth position, becoming her third top ten on the chart, after \\"No Lie\\" and \\"Be the One\\".[50] Two weeks later, it rose to number one, becoming Lipa's first chart-topping song in the United Kingdom.[51] In doing so, it also became the first song in almost two years by a female solo artist to reach the top, since \\"Hello\\" by Adele in 2015.[52] It remained at number one the following week,[53] and was certified two-times Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 2 February 2018.[54] In Ireland, it also spent eight non-consecutive weeks at number one in the singles chart.[55] In Netherlands, it reached the number one on both the Dutch Top 40 and Single Top 100 charts on the week ending 16 September 2017.[56][57] The song also topped the Flemish Ultratop 50 in Belgium. It became her second number one in the territory after \\"Be The One\\" reached number one in March 2016.[58] \\"New Rules\\" has further peaked within the top ten in Finland,[59] Germany,[60] Norway,[61] and Sweden.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, after spending two weeks on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, \\"New Rules\\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 90, becoming her third entry on the ranking, after \\"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\\" and her collaboration with Dutch DJ Martin Garrix \\"Scared to Be Lonely\\" (2017).[63] The track later peaked at number six, becoming Lipa's first top 10 hit in the United States; it also became Lipa's third number one on the Dance Club Songs chart.[64][65] \\"New Rules\\" also topped the Pop Songs chart for four weeks in February 2018.[66] On the list dated 23 June 2018, it spend its forty-second week, becoming the track with the most weeks on the chart.[67] \\"New Rules\\" has been successful in Oceania. On the report dated 29 July 2017, it debuted at number 46 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart.[68] In its ninth week on the chart, it reached number two.[69] The track entered the New Zealand Top 40 Singles chart at number 26 on the report dated 7 August 2017.[70] On the week of 11 September, \\"New Rules\\" reached the third position.[71] It was certified double-platinum by the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) for sales of 60,000.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nLipa talking about the music video's themes.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music video for \\"New Rules\\" was directed by Henry Scholfield, who also shot Lipa's previous visual, \\"Lost in Your Light\\". The singer invited Scholfield for a cup of tea in London in order to discuss her ideas for the clip. Lipa had saved a picture of model Naomi Campbell holding another woman in her back during a campaign in the 1980s as a \\"reference point\\", explaining that, \\"I loved the idea of girls looking after each other like that, holding each other, that sense of humility, that sense of strength.\\" Lipa also had the idea of including a group of flamingos into the clip, as she considered them a good representation of female friendship. The director contacted Teresa Barcelo to choreograph the dance routine and bring that \\"narrative of togetherness and empowerment\\" into it.[23] Barcelo also took inspiration from the flamingos' movements while planning the choreography.[16] More than 200 women auditioned for the video, with eight being selected.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe filming took place in June 2017 at The Confidante, a hotel located in Miami Beach that is part of the Unbound Collection brand by Hyatt.[16] Hyatt's vice president of global brands, Sandra Micek, stated that the collaboration between the artist and the hotel made sense to her because \\"[The Confidante's] inspiration and its name came from the notion of being a trusted friend\\".[73] Regarding the shooting, Scholfield commented that the camera was quite near during the dance routines, in order to film more uninterrupted single takes.[23] During an interview with NPR, Lipa commented that, \\"What I wanted to convey in this video is the unity and togetherness of women supporting each other, helping each other and looking after each other in a situation.\\"[14] The visual premiered through Lipa's YouTube account on 7 July 2017.[10] After this, Hyatt released two behind-the-scenes clips of the shooting.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video starts with a shot of the outside view of The Confidante hotel and two flamingos. In the next scene, and in the context of the track, Lipa is lying on a bed, thinking of giving her ex a second chance, while her friends are by her side. As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer his call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape to the hallway.[10] There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other.[14] They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they walk over the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the song's bridge, one of the women makes plans of reuniting with her former boyfriend, but is stopped by Lipa, who gives her the advice she received at the beginning of the visual. After this, the group perform a choreography in front of the pool, in which they pull \\"each other in closer, in an unbreakable ring of limbs\\". This is Lipa and Scholfield's favorite scene, with the latter stating, \\"That wrapped up the whole story for me. The viewer is on the outside, but that choreography pulls you into them, and makes you a part of that connection, too.\\"[23] The video ends with the women standing in front of the pool, with the camera turning upside-down and then showing a group of flamingos at the same location.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the release of the music video, Lipa debuted on Billboard's Social 50 chart at number 26.[74] It was nominated for the British Music Video of the Year accolade at the 2018 Brit Awards, but lost to \\"Sign of the Times\\" by Harry Styles.[39] In February 2018, the clip surpassed one billion views on YouTube, making Lipa the youngest female artist to accomplish that.[75] As of  July?2018[update], it has received over 1.3 billion views on the website.[76] The music video for \\"New Rules\\" gained many positive reviews from critics, who praised its themes of female empowerment.[77][78] Aliza Abarbanel of Refinery29 commented on the visual, \\"'New Rules', and all the epic outfits in it, perfectly encapsulates the joy of female friendshipand the joy in getting dressed up together.\\"[79] Paper's Claire Valentine labelled it Lipa's \\"strongest video so far.\\"[80] Hafeezah Nazim of Nylon called it \\"a empowering visual\\",[81] while New Statesman writer Anna Leszkiewicz described it as a \\"colourful and acutely choreographed video\\", as well as considering it one of the best clips released in July 2017.[82] Alessia Scappaticci of The Loop praised the visual's themes of self-esteem, diversity and friendship, adding that it \\"definitely deserves all of the positive attention it's been getting\\".[83] T.L. Stanley of Adweek noted that in the plot, the women are \\"standing together, mirroring a current trend in pop culture and entertainment that shows women supporting each other (catfights are so yesterday).\\"[73] BBC reporter Mark Savage wrote that the video is \\"unquestionably brilliant\\" and should have won British Video of the Year at the 2018 Brit Awards.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music video also received positive comments from artists like Lorde, Charli XCX and Tegan and Sara through their respective Twitter accounts.[14] On 12 July 2017, Lipa thanked her fans for the visual's popularity, and recommended them to use the hashtag #DuasNewRules when uploading covers of the track in order to include them on a compilation video.[74] The next day, Filmmaker Jake Wilson uploaded a gay parody of the music video using the hashtag, which drew the attention of some blogs and the artist herself.[85][86] On 4 August 2017, the singer released the compilation video of covers and parodies of the song and the visual on her YouTube account.[87] Owen Myers of The Fader praised the female-empowerment themes of the clip, and furthermore commented on its importance on Lipa's career, stating that, \\"The release of 'New Rules' gave Lipa something else that until then mostly eluded her: credibility. She has often talked in interviews about her feminist beliefs, and taking pride in her involvement with every aspect of her music.\\"[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nLipa performed \\"New Rules\\" at the Glastonbury Festival in England on 23 June 2017.[88] She also sang it on Europa Plus Live in Russia on 30 July 2017.[89] On 4 October 2017, the singer performed \\"New Rules\\" on The Jonathan Ross Show, where she was accompanied by a group of dancers with whom she recreated the scenes of the music video.[90] Later that month, the artist sang the song during the BBC Radio 1 Teen Awards, where she received the Best Single award for the track, and on Later... with Jools Holland.[38][91] On 9 December, she performed \\"New Rules\\" at the Jingle Bell Ball concert in London.[92] Days later, Lipa appeared on the fifth season of Spanish musical competition La Voz, where she sang the song alongside the finalists.[93] Lipa also performed the track during the encore of The Self-Titled Tour (2017ÿ18).[94][95]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 February 2018, Lipa sang \\"New Rules\\" and \\"Homesick\\" on Saturday Night Live.[96] Alex Robert Ross of Noisey reviewed positively the performance, calling it \\"ultimately professional\\" and praising Lipa for her vocal rendition.[97] Ten days later, she appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she performed \\"New Rules\\" accompanied by a group of dancers wearing sleepwear similar to that of the music video.[98] The next day, Lipa sang an acoustic version of the track on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge segment.[99] On 14 February,[100] the artist performed \\"New Rules\\" and \\"IDGAF\\" on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The performance was not aired until 19 March 2018, around the time the singer cancelled two shows in Australia to remove her wisdom teeth.[101] This led journalist Richard Wilkinson, thinking the performance occurred on the air date, to accuse the singer of lying on Nine News. Lipa responded through her Twitter account, indicating the difference between the dates and stating that she was still recovering from the surgery in Australia.[102] Although Wilkinson apologised, the artist later told KIIS FM that she have found his comments \\"dangerous\\" and \\"really upsetting\\".[103] The singer performed \\"New Rules\\" during the 2018 Brit Awards on a summer-styled stage, moments after winning the British Female Solo Artist accolade. Billboard's Rachel George deemed the performance as \\"girl-power inspired\\".[104][105] Lipa's appearance helped her eponymous debut studio album, which had previously peaked at number five, to reach number three on the UK Albums Chart.[106][107] On 20 May 2018, the artist performed \\"New Rules\\" at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards.[108] Six days later, Lipa sang the track as part of a medley of her most successful songs during the opening ceremony of the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final in Kiev, Ukraine.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Dua Lipa.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone^shipments figures based on certification alonesales+streaming figures based on certification alone","input":"What is dua lipa's new rules song about?"},{"output":"Released between 1977 and 2017","context":"The music of the Star Wars franchise is composed and produced in conjunction with the development of the feature films, television series, and other merchandise within the epic space opera franchise created by George Lucas. The music for the primary feature films (which serves as the basis for the rest of the related media) was written by John Williams. Williams' scores for the eight saga films count among the most widely known and popular contributions to modern film music, and utilize a symphony orchestra and features an assortment of fifty recurring musical themes to represent characters and other plot elements: one of the largest caches of themes in the history of film music.\\r\\nReleased between 1977 and 2017, the music for the primary feature films was, in the case of the first two trilogies, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and, in select passages, by the London Voices chorus. Williams also scored the seventh and eighth episodes in the franchise's sequel trilogy, and he is currently slated to score the ninth (and last) episode as well. The sequel trilogy was largely orchestrated and conducted by William Ross, and it was performed by a freelance Hollywood orchestra and (in a few passages) by the Los Angeles Master Chorale.[1]\\r\\nAdditionally, music for several animated television series spinoffs has been written by Kevin Kiner and Ryan Shore.[2] Music for the spin-off films, other television programs, and video games, as well as the trailers of the various installments, were created by various other composers, with this material occasionally revisiting some of Williams' principal themes, and - with the latest spin-off film, with Williams actually writing a new theme for the composer to use. Michael Giacchino was the composer of the first Anthology film, Rogue One, while John Powell will score the Star Wars film Solo.\\r\\nThe scores are primarily performed by a symphony orchestra of varying size joined, in several sections, by a choir of varying size.[3] They each make extensive use of the leitmotif, or a series of musical themes that represents the various characters, objects and events in the films. Throughout all of the franchise, which consists of a total of over 18 hours of music,[4] Williams has written approximately fifty themes in one of the largest, richest collection of themes in the history of film music.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNew London Children's Choir\\r\\nBoy choir (synth)\\r\\nBoy choir (synth)\\r\\nWilliam Ross\\r\\nJohn Williams\\r\\n(main theme)\\r\\nKevin Kiner composed the score to the film Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008), the predecessor to the animated TV series of the same name. Both properties loosely use some of the original themes and music by John Williams. Kiner's own material for the film includes a theme for Anakin Skywalker's Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, as well as a theme for Jabba the Hutt's uncle Ziro. Kiner went on to score the TV series' entire six seasons, which concluded in 2014. A soundtrack album was released that same year by Walt Disney Records.[9]\\r\\nKiner continued his work with the franchise for the animated series Star Wars Rebels (2014), which also incorporates Williams' themes.[10]\\r\\nRyan Shore serves as the composer for Star Wars: Forces of Destiny (2017ÿpresent).\\r\\nThe scores utilize an eclectic variety of musical styles, many culled from the Late Romantic idiom of Richard Strauss and his contemporaries that itself was incorporated into the Golden Age Hollywood scores of Erich Korngold and Max Steiner. The reasons for this are known to involve George Lucas's desire to allude to the underlying fantasy element of the narrative rather than the science-fiction setting, as well as to ground the otherwise strange and fantastic setting in well-known, audience-accessible music. Indeed, Lucas maintains that much of the films' success relies not on advanced visual effects, but on the simple, direct emotional appeal of its plot, characters and, importantly, music.[11]\\r\\nLucas originally wanted to use tracked orchestral and film music in a similar manner to 2001: A Space Odyssey, itself a major inspiration for Star Wars. Williams, however, advised to form a soundtrack with recurring musical themes to augment the story, while Lucas's choice of music could be used as a temporary track for Williams to base his musical choices on. This resulted in several nods or homages to the music of Gustav Holst, William Walton, Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky in the score to Star Wars.[12] Williams relied less and less on references to existing music in the latter seven scores, incorporating more strains of modernist orchestral writing with each progressive score, although occasional nods continue to permeate the music. The love theme from Empire Strikes Back is closely related to Williams' composition for Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.[13] The score to Revenge of the Sith has clear resemblances to the successful scores of other contemporary composers of the time, namely Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings, Hans Zimmer's Gladiator and Tan Dun's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, with which the movie was most likely scored temporarily.[14] Otherwise, however, his later scores were mostly tracked with music of his own composition,[15] mainly from previous Star Wars films.[16] Yet, In Williams' score to The Last Jedi he, for the first time in the series, went so as far as to incorporate direct quotes of other compositions, namely \\"Aquarela Do Brasil\\" by Ary Barroso (in a nod to the 1985 Terry Gilliam film Brazil) and from his own theme for The Long Goodbye (co-composed by Johnny Mercer).[17] Nevertheless, Williams also started to develop his style throughout the various films, incorporating other instruments, unusual orchestral set-ups (as well as various choral ensembles) and even electronic or electronically-attenuated music as the films progressed. Williams often composed the music in a heroic but tongue-in-cheek style.[18]\\r\\nStar Wars was one of the film scores that heralded the revival of grand symphonic scores in the late 1970s. One technique that particularly influenced these scores is Williams' use of the leitmotif, which was most famously associated with the operas of Richard Wagner and, in early film scores, with Steiner. A leitmotif is a phrase or melodic cell that signifies a character, place, plot element, mood, idea, relationship or other specific part of the film. It is commonly used in modern film scoring as a device for mentally anchoring certain parts of a film to the soundtrack.[19] Of chief importance for a leitmotif is that it must be strong enough for a listener to latch onto while being flexible enough to undergo variation and development along the progression of the story. The more varied and nuanced the use of leitmotif is, the more memorable it typically becomes. A good example of this is the way in which Williams subtly conceals the intervals of \\"The Imperial March\\" within Anakin's Theme in The Phantom Menace, implying his dark future to come.\\r\\nAlso important is the density in which leitmotifs are used: the more leitmotifs are used in a piece of a given length, the more thematically rich it is considered to be. Film music, however, typically needs to strike a balance between in terms of the number of leitmotives used, so as to not become too dense for the audience (being preoccupied with the visuals) to follow. John Williams' music of Star Wars is unique in that it is relatively dense for film scoring, with approximately 11 themes used in each two-hour film, of which about 90% is scored.[20]\\r\\nWilliams re-recorded some of his suites from the first trilogy with the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra as an album. Several of his later themes were released as singles and music videos, and were later released a collection of suites from the six films as a compilation that played to a series of clips from the films, with sparse dialogue and sound effects. These became the basis for a series of hour-long concerts which featured Star Wars music to images from the films, Star Wars: In Concert, which took place in 2009 and 2010. First performed in London, it went on to tour across the United States and Canada, last playing in London, Ontario, Canada on July 25, 2010.\\r\\nThe scores of the first trilogy (in the form of its Blu-Ray Special Edition release) and The Force Awakens are performed as Live to Projection concerts, but with greatly reduced forces. The performances follow the music of the finished film, with some of the music looped, tracked or omitted entirely, and do not feature any of the diegetic pieces and often omit the choral parts.[21][22]\\r\\nJohn Williams sketched the score for his various orchestrations and wrote the music for a full symphony orchestra (ranging from 79 to 113 players overall[23]) and, in several passages, chorus (ranging from 12 to 120 singers overall) and a few non-orchestral instruments. The orchestration is not consistent throughout the different films,[24] but generally the score makes use of a considerable brass section over a comparatively smaller string section, giving the series its heraldic, brassy sound.\\r\\nSeveral of the scores require larger forces, including a large (over 100-piece) romantic-period orchestra, a mixed choir and even a boy choir, although none of the scores call for particularly immense forces compared to larger film or theater works.[25] Nevertheless, due to added high woodwinds and percussion parts, scores such as Empire Strikes Back and Attack of the Clones call for 106 and 110 players, respectively. The former called for a third harp and fourth bassoon, while the latter (and all prequel scores) utilized a fuller string section. Revenge of the Sith also utilized a second set of timpani. Comparatively, the original Star Wars trilogy and the sequel trilogy films call for much smaller forces of as little as 82 players, and small choral accompaniment in select cues.[26] The first spin off film, Rogue One, followed the prequel trilogy's instrumentation, using a 110-piece orchestra and 90-piece mixed choir.\\r\\nIn live performances, the forces are usually greatly reduced: Official Star Wars Concerts were held with as little as 60-piece orchestras and 50-piece mixed choral ensembles or with the choir omitted altogether.[27] However, to recreate the eight scores as they were originally recorded, the following instrumentation is required:\\r\\nJohn Williams wrote a series of themes and motifs for certain characters and ideas in each of the Star Wars films. The multiple installments allowed Williams to compose some 52 themes (and counting) and reprise some of them extensively, continually developing them over a long period of screen time.\\r\\nWilliams introduced a few themes in each episode (six themes on average) and focused on making each of his principal themes long-lined and melodically distinct from the others so as to increase their memorability. Williams occasionally forges small connections between some of these themes, sometimes for a narrative purpose and sometimes in the more general favor of cohesion. This technique allowed him (especially in his scores to the first trilogy) to have each theme play out for a large number of occasions (the Force Theme plays over one hundred times in the series) and over long periods of time.\\r\\nEach score can be said to have a \\"main theme\\", which is developed and repeated frequently throughout the film, often to unusual extents (such as the frequency in which The Imperial March is revisited during Empire Strikes Back).[37] Besides the main theme and a handful of other principal themes, Williams forged several smaller motifs for each episode, which are generally not as memorable and at times interchangeable. A main theme for the franchise exists as well (which is the music of the main titles) but, interestingly, a main theme does not exist to represent a particular trilogy. Instead, each trilogy (and to a lesser extent, each film) has its own style or soundscape.[38]\\r\\nWilliams' Star Wars catalog remains one of the largest collections of leitmotifs in the history of cinema,[39] although it still falls short of Wagner's use of leitmotifs in the Ring Cycle or even Howard Shore's work on the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings films.[40] Both works feature many more themes for a similar or shorter running time; and use the themes more clearly and with more nuance, where Williams prefers to write fewer themes (to allow him to focus on them better) and use them in a more straightforward manner and sometimes, solely for their romantic effect. Shore and Wagner's themes are also inter-related and arranged into sets of subsets of related themes through various melodic or harmonic connections, whereas Williams prefers greater distinction between his themes.[41]\\r\\nWilliams' use of his themes in Star Wars is at times romantic rather than strictly thematic,[42] the themes sometimes being used randomly because their mood fits a certain scene, rather than for a narrative purpose. For instance, the theme for Luke Skywalker is also used as the main theme for the entire franchise, as well as a generic \\"heroic theme\\" in conjunction with various characters without any connection to its namesake. Princess Leia's Theme is used for the death of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original Star Wars, which has little to do with her character even though she is present in the scene.[43] Yoda's Theme appears several times during the Cloud City sequences in The Empire Strikes Back.[44] The concert piece Duel of the Fates is used several times throughout the prequel trilogy, appearing over the entire final battle in The Phantom Menace (as opposed to just the lightsaber duel for which it was written); Anakin Skywalker's search for his mother in Attack of the Clones;[45] and the unrelated Yoda and Darth Sidious's duel in Revenge of the Sith. Williams' original composition for the Geonosis Battle Arena in Attack of the Clones was used for the Utapau assault in Revenge of the Sith. Multiple uses of the Force Theme are also non-thematic.[46]\\r\\nThe Rebel Fanfare is applied to the Millennium Falcon throughout the original Star Wars, The Force Awakens, and The Last Jedi. It is also used for R2-D2's heroics during the opening action scene in Revenge of the Sith. Kylo Ren's secondary theme, meant to evoke his more conflicted side, is often used interchangeably with his main theme, in a similarly menacing setting.[13] The Emperor's theme is used in The Last Jedi when Supreme Leader Snoke tortures Rey. Even the melodic connections between some of the themes sometimes do not represent a straightforward dramatic purpose, such as the connection of \\"Across the Stars\\" to Count Dooku's motif and the Battle of Geonosis in Attack of the Clones. In fact, Some of Williams' themes are written from the outset purely to convey a certain mood rather than evoke a character or setting, such as the Throne Room music of the original Star Wars or the Pursuit motif from The Force Awakens.\\r\\nSome of this music was re-tracked into other parts of the film, or even another film in the series, by the filmmakers. Attack of the Clones, the first film to be shot digitally, had major edits made after the scoring process, leading to the inclusion of tracked music over many of the digitally-created sequences such as the Droid Factory on Geonosis or the Clone Army's arrival to the battle. These scenes used music such as Yoda's theme or incidental music from The Phantom Menace with little dramatic connection to what is occurring on screen. In the original Star Wars, some of the music for the Death Star's Trash Compactor scene was used over an extended shot of the arrival into Mos Eisley inserted in the film's Special Edition. Musical similarities exist between the final scenes of The Phantom Menace with Finn's confession to Rey in The Force Awakens, probably a result of temp-track choice.[47] In other cases, the material wasn't tracked but rather lifted from the original composition and re-recorded, such as in the big action scenes of Return of the Jedi, both of which lift material from the Battle of Yavin and Ben's death.\\r\\nOther composers for the franchise used Williams' principal themes in their own compositions, whether it be for the trailers to the main films, spin-off films, television series, or video games. More often than not, these composers also use the principal themes more for their emotional effect for their respective projects. Michael Giacchino, for instance, uses the Force Theme in some of the scenes where Rogue One's Starship takes off.\\r\\nBecause Williams scores one episode at a time[48] and attempts to base each score on new material as much as possible, the musical material does not have a particularly cohesive structure as a whole: the themes for each score are only devised during each film's post-production, so Williams will often come up with a new theme that, in hindsight, would have been preferably introduced, at least in embryonic form, in a previous score: This can be said for the love theme \\"Across the Stars\\" (for Anakin Skywalker and Padm Amidala), introduced only in \\"Attack of the Clones\\"[49] or even \\"The Imperial March\\", introduced in Empire Strikes Back. The same can be said about some themes only composed for the prequels (such as Duel of the Fates), which would have been perfectly applicable to the films in the first trilogy, had they been produced in the narrative order. In fact, since the prequels featured both their own stock of leitmotives and recurring themes from the previous films, they boasted a larger catalog of themes, whereas the use of the leitmotifs in a cycle of works typically involves increasing density towards the later installments in the narrative order. Also, the themes in the prequels appear in shorter, blockier statements and the motives themselves are often short, rhythmic ideas, as opposed to longer melodies used in the first trilogy. Also, in the prequels the motives are often associated with places and events, rather than with characters as they are in the rest of the scores, creating a further discrepancy in the musical narrative.\\r\\nEven within each trilogy, Williams often abandons a motif after a single score or two (as he did with Anakin's theme), writes (across several films) multiple motifs that serve a similar function (e.g. the Rebel fanfare, the Throne Room March and the Triumph Fanfare in Return of the Jedi), or writes a motif that he only uses in one installment, such as the Droid motif. In other cases, a motif is supplanted by a new one, as the Imperial March replaced the original, Imperial motif - a problem only confounded when he returned to that theme with the prequels, only for it to disappear entirely for what is now supposed to be the fourth episode; sometimes, the existing motif simply changes its thematic meaning: Ben Kenobi's theme turned into a theme for The Force by Empire Strikes Back, and Luke's theme - into the \\"Star Wars theme\\".\\r\\nThe Last Jedi, specifically, departs from Williams method of relying primarily on new thematic material, and instead relies heavily on pre-existing themes, in keeping with Johnson's temp-track choices. As a result, a number of themes and motifs from the previous films are constantly repeated, often in very familiar settings, such as statements of Yoda's and Leia's theme that are lifted from the concert arrangements, a reprise of the Binary Sunset rendition of the Force theme, and recurring statements of Rey's and Kylo's themes. There are some incidental phrases similar to existing themes such as Battle of the Heroes, The Immolation scene, etcetra, and some deliberate, tongue-in-cheek references, such as a quote of the Death Star motif for a scene with a clothes iron that is shot to look like a landing Star Destroyer.\\r\\nListed below are 51 leitmotifs identified in Williams' scores (and another one written by Williams for John Powell's upcoming score to Solo) thus far, although a few of them could be contested. Other pieces of music, described either erroneously or tenuously as leitmotifs, are discussed under \\"unconfirmed leitmotifs\\" below.\\r\\nReturning: Throne Room Victory March;[66] Luke's Theme; The Rebel Fanfare; The Force Theme; Princess Leia's Theme\\r\\nReturning: Spaceship Battle Motif;[56][76] Luke's Theme; The Rebel Fanfare; The Force Theme; Princess Leia's Theme; The Imperial March; Han Solo and the Princess; Yoda's Theme\\r\\nReturning: Luke's Theme, The Rebel Fanfare, The Force Theme, The Imperial March, Yoda's Theme, Jabba's Theme, The Emperor's Theme\\r\\nReturning: Shmi's Theme;[88] Luke's Theme, The Rebel Fanfare, The Force Theme, The Imperial March, The Emperor's Theme, Anakin's Theme, Trade Federation March, Duel of the Fates\\r\\nReturning: Jedi Funeral Theme,[98] Coruscant Fanfare;[99] Luke's Theme, The Rebel Fanfare, The Force Theme, The Imperial March, The Emperor's Theme, Anakin's Theme, Trade Federation March, Duel of the Fates, Across the Stars\\r\\nReturning: Luke's Theme, The Rebel Fanfare, The Force theme, Leia's Theme[105], The Imperial March, Han Solo and the Princess\\r\\nReturning: Luke's Theme, The Rebel Fanfare, The Force Theme, Leia's Theme, Yoda's Theme, Luke and Leia, Han Solo and the Princess, The Imperial March, Spaceship Battle Motif, The Emperor's Theme, Poe's Theme, Rey's Theme, Kylo Ren's themes, Snoke's Theme\\r\\nSince neither Williams nor his office ever provided a full list of the leitmotifs used in every Star Wars film, there is some controversy around the exact number of themes, with some taking an inclusive approach that identifies various leitmotifs, even where the composer probably never intended for,[120] and others taking an exclusive approach.[121]\\r\\nOne of the key differences between the two approaches in the way in which Williams' main, long themes are approached: some view them as comprised of several leitmotives that can appear (once or several times) in isolation from the unabridged theme, and may even represent a different facet of the plot element or character that the theme stands for,[122] while others see them as a single theme with multiple components, which can appear in fragmented form by use of only one of the said components to suggest the entire theme. The featured list of themes follows what could be deduced to be Williams own approach, seeing as how he - in his liner notes - didn't refer to such pieces as the B-phrase of Luke's theme, or the ostinato accompaniment or B-phrase of the Imperial March, distinct as they are, as separate thematic ideas. Its also, largely, the approach taken by Matessino and Adams.\\r\\nCertain analysts will also list a single melody multiple times under various guises. For instance, the emperor's theme can also be labeled separately (in the same glossary) as the \\"dark side\\" theme, Darth Sidius' theme, etc...[13][123]\\r\\nThe inclusive approach also tends to identify leitmotives even where they don't meet the criteria of recurrence. This is the result of Williams' propensity (in these scores and otherwise) to write material that is either melodic, rhythmic, harmonic or timbral specifically to an individual setpiece or none-recurring plot-element in the film, such as The Battle of Hoth, the Chase through Coruscant, or The Battle of Crait. These individual pieces of music have sometimes been described as having thematic significance,[124] occasionally (in fleeting comments) even by Williams himself,[125] but since they do not recur in a different part of the narrative, they are not truly thematic in any way.[126]\\r\\nEven when some of these figures do recur, it is often unclear whether they are substantial enough to be assigned with thematic significance, as these instances often includes material that is incidental in nature (such as several figures used in the finale of The Empire Strikes Back);[127] material that is purely rhythmic or timbral like various \\"bouncing\\" horn figures for Luke's landspeeder search in the original Star Wars,[125] the use of the synthesizer to represent Vader's menace in The Empire Strikes Back, a women's chorus for the underwater scenes of The Phantom Menace; material that is of a generic nature, such as his use of \\"mournful homophonic\\" choir in The Last Jedi for climactic moments;[128] or material that is part of Williams' stylistic choices as a composer, more than a thematic statement unique to the series. For instance, his use of tritones often denotes mystery, a device he uses for the droids landing on Tatooine and again in the concert arrangement of \\"The Throne Room.\\" He uses a related device to reflect the mystery of Luke's whereabouts in The Force Awakens. However, similar devices are also used in Indiana Jones to represent the mysteries of the Ark[129] and the Crystal Skull. Hence, it is more of a way for Williams to evoke mystery, than a motif conceived specifically for any one of these scores.\\r\\nSimilarly, other gestures taken from pre-existing music (such as Williams' use of the Dies Irae melody to denote impending doom) have been falsely identified as leitmotifs, even though Williams clearly described sections of music that rely on this gesture, such as his original take of the binary sunset, as non-thematic.[130]\\r\\nIn fact, sometimes the supposedly recurring material is similar, but not in fact identical. A good example would be the variety of gestures relating to the dark side, following a piece of music used in the opera-house scene. Lehamn however clarifies that those alleged following statements are \\"similar but inexact\\" to the earlier gesture.[56] In other cases, variations on the same thematic ideas are erroneously labeled as two or more separate themes, such as a secondary droid motif or a motif for Anakin's immolation, which is in fact a variation on his lament theme.[123]\\r\\nSometimes, the recurring material is question is not part of the original composition but is rather tracked after-the-fact, or at least lifted, from existing material into a different section of the film. This includes the Podracing fanfare and the ostinato accompaniment of the Rebel Fanfare,[13][131] which otherwise doesn't appear isolated from the unabridged theme more than once; the mournful writing for French horn at Shmi's funeral, the Arena March from Attack of the Clones[89][56] etc.\\r\\nEven within the featured list of themes, some of the motifs are not entirely beyond questioning. The Jawa theme, for instance, is technically setpiece-specific (with only a short segue to the Imperial material breaking it up); The Throne Room March doesn't have a clear association with any narrative element and therefore is \\"certainly not a theme in the leitmotivic sense\\" according to Adams,[13] and similar doubts can be cast at some of the infrequent motives such as the quote of the \\"Coruscant\\" fanfare during Revenge of the Sith, the triumph fanfare from Return of the Jedi, the mystery arpeggios from Attack of the Clones,[132] Shmi's music,[88] etc...\\r\\nThe first Star Wars Anthology score for Rogue One, written by Michael Giacchino, utilizes several themes (and recurring interstitial material) from John Williams, mostly for their Romantic sweep (such as The Force Theme and hints of the Main Theme). It has its own catalog of themes, independent from Williams' material, including a new, third theme for the Empire, although Giacchino also quotes both the original Imperial Motif and The Imperial March.\\r\\n[133][134]\\r\\nFor Solo, John Williams will contribute a theme for the character Han Solo; all other leitmotifs and other material will be written and adapted by John Powell, the main composer for the film.[135]\\r\\nInstead of offering a full recording release of a particular film, Williams typically releases a condensed score on album, in which the music is arranged out of the film order and more within the veins of a concert program. These album releases typically include several concert suites, written purely for the end credits or the album itself, where a specific theme is developed continuously throughout the piece. Williams also re-edited some of his existing cues after the fact in order to \\"concertize\\" theme on the behest of conductors such as Charles Gerhardt. Five of the eight films also have unique credit suites that features alternate concert arrangements of themes and/or a medley of the main themes of a particular film.\\r\\nFrom Star Wars\\r\\n[57][61][55]\\r\\nFrom The Empire Strikes Back\\r\\n[75][73][68]\\r\\nFrom Return of the Jedi\\r\\n[80][78]\\r\\nFrom The Phantom Menace\\r\\n[49][137][138]\\r\\nFrom Attack of the Clones\\r\\n[92][140][141]\\r\\nFrom Revenge of the Sith\\r\\n[100][101][142]\\r\\nFrom The Force Awakens[110]\\r\\n[110][108][144]\\r\\nFrom The Last Jedi\\r\\nFrom Rogue One\\r\\n[146][147][134]\\r\\nDiegetic music is music \\"that occurs as part of the action (rather than as background), and can be heard by the film's characters\\".[148] In addition to the orchestral scope that was brought on by John Williams' musical score, the Star Wars franchise also features many distinguishing diegetic songs that enrich the detail of the audio mise-en-scne. Some of this diegetic music was written by John Williams; some by his son, Joseph; and some by various other people.[149]\\r\\nFrom Star Wars\\r\\nFrom Return of the Jedi\\r\\nFrom The Phantom Menace\\r\\nFrom Attack of the Clones\\r\\nFrom The Force Awakens\\r\\nFrom The Last Jedi\\r\\nThe score for the original Star Wars film of 1977 won John Williams the most awards of his career:\\r\\nHe also received the 1977 Saturn Award for Best Music for both the Star Wars score and his score for Close Encounters of the Third Kind.[155]\\r\\nWilliams's score for the 1980 sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, also earned him a number of awards:\\r\\nThe Empire Strikes Back was also nominated in 1981 for Best Original Score the 53rd Academy Awards (the award was won by Michael Gore for Fame).[158]\\r\\nWilliams's subsequent Star Wars film music was nominated for a number of awards; in 1984 his score for Return of the Jedi was nominated for Best Original Score at the 56th Academy Awards.[159] His compositions for the prequel trilogy also received nominations: the score for The Phantom Menace was nominated for Best Instrumental Composition at the 2000 Grammy Awards[160] and Revenge of the Sith was nominated at the 2006 Grammy Awards for Best Soundtrack Album.[161]\\r\\nIn 2005 the 1977 soundtrack for Star Wars was voted as the \\"most memorable film score of all time\\" by the American Film Institute in the list AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores, based on the assessment of a jury of over 500 artists, composers, musicians, critics and historians from the film industry.[162]\\r\\nIn 2016, John Williams was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Score, his 50th overall nomination, for his score to Star Wars: The Force Awakens. He would later go on to win the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for the film, his 23rd Grammy win overall.\\r\\nThe soundtracks to both Star Wars and Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace have been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of at least 1 million units, with the albums for The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones being certified Gold (500,000 units).[163] The British Phonographic Industry certified Star Wars and Episode I as Gold for shipments of over 100,000 units in the UK.[164]","input":"When was the star wars theme song composed?"},{"output":"Hilton Head Island, sometimes referred to as simply Hilton Head","context":"Hilton Head Island, sometimes referred to as simply Hilton Head, is a Lowcountry resort town and barrier island in Beaufort County, South Carolina, United States.[2] It is 20 miles (32?km) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, and 95 miles (153?km) southwest of Charleston. The island is named after Captain William Hilton, who in 1663 identified a headland near the entrance to Port Royal Sound, which he named \\"Hilton's Head\\" after himself. The island features 12 miles (19?km) of beachfront on the Atlantic Ocean and is a popular vacation destination. In 2004, an estimated 2.25 million visitors pumped more than $1.5 billion into the local economy.[3] The year-round population was 37,099 at the 2010 census,[4] although during the peak of summer vacation season the population can swell to 150,000.[5] Over the past decade, the island's population growth rate was 32%.[6] Hilton Head Island is a primary city within the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 207,413 in 2015.\\r\\nThe island has a rich history that started with seasonal occupation by Native Americans thousands of years ago, and continued with European exploration and the Sea Island Cotton trade. It became an important base of operations for the Union blockade of the Southern ports during the Civil War. Once the island fell to Union troops, hundreds of ex-slaves flocked to Hilton Head, which is still home to many \\"native islanders\\", many of whom are descendants of freed slaves known as the Gullah (or Geechee) who have managed to hold on to much of their ethnic and cultural identity.[7]\\r\\nThe Town of Hilton Head Island incorporated as a municipality in 1983 and is well known for its eco-friendly development.[8] The town's Natural Resources Division enforces the Land Management Ordinance which minimizes the impact of development and governs the style of buildings and how they are situated amongst existing trees.[9] As a result, Hilton Head Island enjoys an unusual amount of tree cover relative to the amount of development.[10] Approximately 70% of the island, including most of the tourist areas, is located inside gated communities.[11] However, the town maintains several public beach access points, including one for the exclusive use of town residents, who have approved several multimillion-dollar land-buying bond referendums to control commercial growth.[12]\\r\\nHilton Head Island offers an unusual number of cultural opportunities for a community its size, including plays at the Arts Center of Coastal Carolina, the 120-member full chorus of the Hilton Head Choral Society, the Hilton Head Symphony Orchestra, an annual outdoor, tented wine tasting event on the east coast, and several other annual community festivals. It also hosts the Heritage Golf Classic, a PGA Tour tournament played on the Harbour Town Golf Links in Sea Pines Resort.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sea Pines shell ring can be seen near the east entrance to the Sea Pines Forest Preserve. The ring, one of only 20 in existence, is 150 feet (46?m) in diameter and is believed to be over 4,000 years old. Archeologists believe that the ring was a refuse heap, created by Indians who lived in the interior of the ring, which was kept clear and used as a common area. Two other shell rings on Hilton Head were destroyed when the shells were removed and used to make tabby for roads and buildings. The Green's Shell Enclosure, Sea Pines, and Skull Creek shell rings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places and are protected by law.[14]\\r\\nSince the beginning of recorded history in the New World, the waters around Hilton Head Island have been known, occupied and fought for in turn by the English, Spanish, French, and Scots.[15]\\r\\nA Spanish expedition led by Francisco Cordillo explored the area in 1521, initiating European contact with local tribes.[16] In 1663, Captain William Hilton sailed on the Adventure from Barbados to explore lands granted by King Charles II of England to the eight Lords Proprietor. In his travels, he identified a headland near the entrance to Port Royal Sound. He named it \\"Hilton's Head\\" after himself.[17] He stayed for several days, making note of the trees, crops, \\"sweet water\\", and \\"clear sweet air\\".[18]\\r\\nIn 1698, Hilton Head Island was granted as part of a barony to John Bayley of Ballingclough, County of Tipperary, Kingdom of Ireland. Another John Bayley, son of the first, appointed Alexander Trench as the island's first retail agent. For a time, Hilton Head was known as Trench's Island. In 1729, Trench sold some land to John Gascoine which Gascoine named \\"John's Island\\" after himself. The land later came to be known as Jenkin's Island after another owner.[19]\\r\\nIn the mid-1740s, the South Carolina provincial half-galley Beaufort was stationed in a cove at the southern tip of Hilton Head to guard against intrusions by the Spanish of St. Augustine. The point and cove are named after Captain David Cutler Braddock, commander of the Beaufort. Captain Braddock was a mariner and privateer of note in Colonial times. Earlier, he had been placed in command of the Georgia schooner Norfolk by James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and helped chase the Spanish back to St. Augustine after their failed 1742 invasion of St. Simons Island. After relocating to Savannah in 1746, he served two terms in the Georgia Commons House of Assembly while earning a living as a highly active privateer. He drew a well-known chart of the Florida Keys while on a privateering venture in 1756. The chart[20] is in the Library of Congress.\\r\\nIn 1788, a small Episcopal church called the Zion Chapel of Ease was constructed for plantation owners. The chapel's old cemetery, located near the corner of William Hilton Parkway and Mathews Drive (Folly Field), is all that remains. Charles Davant, a prominent island planter during the Revolutionary War, is buried there. Davant was shot by Captain Martinangel of Daufuskie Island in 1781.[17] This location is also home to the oldest intact structure on Hilton Head Island, the Baynard Mausoleum, which was built in 1846.\\r\\nWilliam Elliott II of Myrtle Bank Plantation grew the first crop of Sea Island Cotton in South Carolina on Hilton Head Island in 1790.\\r\\nDuring the Civil War, Fort Walker was a Confederate fort in what is now Port Royal Plantation. The fort was a station for Confederate troops, and its guns helped protect the 2-mile wide (3?km) entrance to Port Royal Sound, which is fed by two slow-moving and navigable rivers, the Broad River and the Beaufort River. It was vital to the Sea Island Cotton trade and the southern economy.[21] On October 29, 1861, the largest fleet ever assembled in North America moved south to seize it.[22] In the Battle of Port Royal, the fort came under attack by the U.S. Navy, and on November 7, 1861, it fell to over 12,000 Union troops.[23] The fort was renamed Fort Welles, in honor of Gideon Welles, the Secretary of the Navy.[24]\\r\\nHilton Head Island had tremendous significance in the Civil War and became an important base of operations for the Union blockade of the Southern ports, particularly Savannah and Charleston. The Union also built a military hospital on Hilton Head Island with a 1,200-foot (370?m) frontage and a floor area of 60,000 square feet (6,000?m2).[25]\\r\\nHundreds of ex-slaves flocked to Hilton Head Island, where they could buy land, go to school, live in government housing, and serve in what was called the First Regiment of South Carolina Volunteers (although in the beginning, many were \\"recruited\\" at the point of a bayonet).[26] A community called Mitchelville (in honor of General Ormsby M. Mitchel) was constructed on the north end of the island to house them.[27]\\r\\nThe Leamington Lighthouse was built in the 1870s on the southern edge of what is now Palmetto Dunes.\\r\\nOn August 27, 1893, the Sea Islands Hurricane made landfall near Savannah, with a storm surge of 16 feet (5?m), and swept north across South Carolina, killing over a thousand and leaving tens of thousands homeless.[28]\\r\\nAn experimental steam cannon guarding Port Royal Sound was built around 1900, in what is now Port Royal Plantation. The cannon was fixed but its propulsion system allowed for long range shots for the time.\\r\\nIn 1931, Wall Street tycoon, physicist, and patron of scientific research Alfred Lee Loomis, along with his brother-in-law and partner Landon K. Thorne, purchased 17,000 acres (69?km2) on the island (over 63% of the total land mass) for about $120,000 to be used as a private game reserve.[29][30] On the Atlantic coast of the island, large concrete gun platforms were built to defend against a possible invasion by the Axis powers of World War II. Platforms like these can be found all along the Eastern Seaboard. The Mounted Beach Patrol and Dog Training Center on Hilton Head Island trained U.S. Coast Guard Beach Patrol personnel to use horses and dogs to protect the southeastern coastline of the U.S.[31]\\r\\nIn the early 1950s, three lumber mills contributed to the logging of 19,000 acres (77?km2) of the island.[16] The island population was only 300 residents.[16] Prior to 1956, access to Hilton Head was limited to private boats and a state-operated ferry. The island's economy centered on shipbuilding, cotton, lumbering, and fishing.[8]\\r\\nThe James F. Byrnes Bridge was built in 1956. It was a two-lane toll swing bridge constructed at a cost of $1.5 million that opened the island to automobile traffic from the mainland.[16] The swing bridge was hit by a barge in 1974 which shut down all vehicle traffic to the island until the Army Corps of Engineers built and manned a pontoon bridge while the bridge was being repaired. The swing bridge was replaced by the current four-lane bridge in 1982.[16]\\r\\nThe beginning of Hilton Head as a resort started in 1956 with Charles E. Fraser developing Sea Pines Resort. Soon, other developments followed, such as Hilton Head Plantation, Palmetto Dunes Plantation, Shipyard Plantation, and Port Royal Plantation, imitating Sea Pines' architecture and landscape. Sea Pines however continued to stand out by creating a unique locality within the plantation called Harbour Town, anchored by a recognizable lighthouse.[32] Fraser was a committed environmentalist who changed the whole configuration of the marina at Harbour Town to save an ancient live oak.[11] It came to be known as the Liberty Oak, known to generations of children who watched singer and songwriter Gregg Russell perform under the tree for over 25 years.[33] Fraser was buried next to the tree when he died in 2002.[34]\\r\\nThe Heritage Golf Classic was first played in Sea Pines Resort in 1969 and has been a regular stop on the PGA Tour ever since.[13] Also in 1969, the Hilton Head Island Community Association successfully fought off the development of a BASF chemical complex on the shores of Victoria Bluff (now Colleton River Plantation). Soon after, the association and other concerned citizens \\"south of the Broad\\" fought the development of off-shore oil platforms by Brown & Root (a division of Halliburton) and ten-story tall liquefied natural gas shipping spheres by Chicago Bridge & Iron.[35] These events helped to polarize the community, and the Chamber of Commerce started drumming up support for the town to incorporate as a municipality. After the Four Seasons Resort (now Hilton Head Resort) was built along William Hilton Parkway, a referendum of incorporation was passed in May 1983. Hilton Head Island had become a town.[35]\\r\\nThe Land Management Ordinance was passed by the Town Council in 1987. Disney's Hilton Head Island Resort opened in 1996, and the Cross Island Parkway opened in January 1997. An indoor smoking ban in bars, restaurants, and public places took effect on May 1, 2007.[36] Shelter Cove Towne Centre opened in 2014.\\r\\nFort Howell, Cherry Hill School, Daufuskie Island Historic District, Fish Haul Archaeological Site (38BU805), Green's Shell Enclosure, Hilton Head Range Rear Light, Sea Pines, Skull Creek, SS William Lawrence Shipwreck Site, and Stoney-Baynard Plantation are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[37]\\r\\nHilton Head Island is a shoe-shaped island that lies 20 miles (32?km) by air northeast of Savannah, Georgia, and 90 miles (140?km) south of Charleston.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 69.2 square miles (179.1?km2), of which 41.4 square miles (107.1?km2) is land, and 27.8 square miles (71.9?km2), or 40.17%, is water.[4]\\r\\nHilton Head Island is sometimes referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a barrier island but two glacial moraines).[38] Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half barrier island. The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a barrier island that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the two halves of the island.[39]\\r\\nThe terrain of a barrier island is determined by a dynamic beach system with offshore bars, pounding surf, and shifting beaches; as well as grassy dunes behind the beach, maritime forests with wetlands in the interiors, and salt or tidal marshes on the lee side, facing the mainland. A typical barrier island has a headland, a beach and surf zone, and a sand spit.[40]\\r\\nThe Hilton Head Island area is home to a vast array of wildlife, including alligators, deer, loggerhead sea turtles, manatees, hundreds of species of birds,[41] and dolphins.\\r\\nThe Coastal Discovery Museum, in conjunction with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, patrols the beaches from May through October as part of the Sea Turtle Protection Project.[42] The purpose of the project is to inventory and monitor nesting locations, and if necessary, move them to more suitable locations. During the summer months, the museum sponsors the Turtle Talk & Walk, which is a special tour designed to educate the public about this endangered species.[42] To protect loggerhead sea turtles, a town ordinance stipulates that artificial lighting must be shielded so that it cannot be seen from the beach, or it must be turned off by 10:00?p.m. from May 1 to October 31 each year.[43] The waters around Hilton Head Island are one of the few places on Earth where dolphins routinely use a technique called \\"strand feeding\\", whereby schools of fish are herded up onto mud banks, and the dolphins lie on their side while they feed before sliding back down into the water.[44][45]\\r\\nParticularly prominent in the ocean waters surrounding Hilton Head Island, the stingray serves as a fascination and painful natural encounter for many beach goers. Small stingrays inhabit the quieter, shallow region of ocean floor just beyond the break of the surf, typically buried beneath a thin layer of sand. Stingrays are a type of demersal,[46] cartilaginous fish common to the South Carolina coast as well as other areas on the Atlantic shoreline. Typically, stingrays avoid contact with humans unless they are accidentally stepped upon, a situation often ending in a stingray injury, where the stingray punctures the human with its poisonous barb. While these injuries are extremely painful, they are not usually life-threatening as long as they are properly attended to by a medical professional.[47] One complaint shared by many Hilton Head Island tourists is that the lifeguards maintain a poor alert system for notifying swimmers when numerous stingrays have been sighted within a specific stretch of the shore. This lack of notification on days when multiple sightings are reported can sometimes end in a high number of stingray injuries that might have otherwise been avoided; in 2009, 121 people were treated for stingray injuries.[48]\\r\\nThe saltmarsh estuaries of Hilton Head Island are the feeding grounds, breeding grounds, and nurseries for many saltwater species of game fish, sport fish, and marine mammals. The dense plankton population gives the coastal water its murky brown-green coloration.\\r\\nPlankton support marine life including oysters, shrimp and other invertebrates, and bait-fish species including menhaden and mullet, which in turn support larger fish and mammal species that populate the local waterways. Popular sport fish in the Hilton Head Island area include the red drum (or spot tail bass), spotted sea trout, sheepshead, cobia, tarpon, and various shark species.[49]\\r\\nHilton Head Island has a humid subtropical climate.\\r\\nAs of the census of 2010,[1] there were 37,099 people, 16,535 households, and 10,700 families residing in the town, occupying a land area of 42.06 square miles (109?km2). The population density was 882.0 people per square mile (340.4/km2). There were 33,602 housing units at an average density of 798.9 per square mile (308.3/km2).\\r\\nAlthough the town occupies most of the land area of the island, it is not coterminous with it; there is a small part near the main access road from the mainland, William Hilton Parkway, which is not incorporated into the town. Hilton Head (the island) therefore has a slightly higher population (48,407 in Census 2000, defined as the Hilton Head Island Urban Cluster) and a larger land area (42.65?sq?mi or 110.5?km2) than the town. The Hilton Head Island-Bluffton Beaufort Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Beaufort and Jasper counties, had a 2012 estimated year-round population of 193,882.[52]\\r\\nThe racial makeup of the town was 82.9% White, 7.5% African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 7.3% from other races, and 1.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 15.8% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 16,535 households in which 18.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.7% were married couples living together, 6.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.3% were non-families. 28.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 14.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.23 and the average family size was 2.66.\\r\\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 18% under the age of 20, 4.4% from 20 to 24, 20.4% from 25 to 44, 28.4% from 45 to 64, and 28.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 50.9 years. For every 100 females there were 103.8 males.

The term symbolizes the efforts by the Soviet Union to block itself and its satellite states from open contact with the West and its allied states. On the east side of the Iron Curtain were the countries that were connected to or influenced by the Soviet Union, while on the west side were the countries that were allied to the United States or nominally neutral. Separate international economic and military alliances were developed on each side of the Iron Curtain:\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysically, the Iron Curtain took the form of border defences between the countries of Europe in the middle of the continent. The most notable border was marked by the Berlin Wall and its Checkpoint Charlie, which served as a symbol of the Curtain as a whole.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events that demolished the Iron Curtain started in discontent in Poland,[2][3] and continued in Hungary, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. Romania became the only communist state in Europe to overthrow its totalitarian government with violence.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the term iron curtain as a metaphor for strict separation goes back at least as far as the early 19th century. It originally referred to fireproof curtains in theaters.[6] Although its popularity as a Cold War symbol is attributed to its use in a speech Winston Churchill gave in 5 March 1946 in Fulton, Missouri,[6] German Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels had already used the term in reference to the Soviet Union.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious usages of the term \\"iron curtain\\" (Russian: A춶ֳ ־ Zheleznyj zanaves; German: Eiserner Vorhang; Georgian: ?????? ????? Rkinis pharda; Czech and Slovak: ?elezn opona; Hungarian: Vasfgg?ny; Romanian: Cortina de fier; Italian: Cortina di ferro; Serbian: ־ ־ Gvozdena zavesa; Estonian: Raudne eesriie; Bulgarian: A춶 ־ Zhelyazna zaves?) pre-date Churchill's use of the phrase. The concept goes back to the Babylonian Talmud of the 3rd to 5th centuries CE, where Tractate Sota 38b refers to a \\"mechitza shel barzel\\", an iron barrier or divider: \\"????? ????? ?? ???? ???? ????? ??? ????? ?????? ??????\\" (Even an iron barrier cannot separate [the people of] Israel from their heavenly father).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"iron curtain\\" has since been used metaphorically in two rather different senses ÿ firstly to denote the end of an era and secondly to denote a closed geopolitical border.  The source of these metaphors can refer to either the safety curtain deployed in theatres (the first one was installed by the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1794[8]) or to roller shutters used to secure commercial premises.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first metaphorical usage of \\"iron curtain\\", in the sense of an end of an era, perhaps should be attributed to British author Arthur Machen (1863ÿ1947), who used the term in his 1895 novel The Three Impostors: \\"...the door clanged behind me with the noise of thunder, and I felt that an iron curtain had fallen on the brief passage of my life\\".[10]  The English translation of a Russian text shown immediately below repeats the use of \\"clang\\" with reference to an \\"iron curtain\\", suggesting that the Russian writer, publishing 23 years after Machen, may have been familiar with the popular British author.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen Elisabeth of the Belgians used the term \\"Iron Curtain\\" in the context of World War I to describe the political situation between Belgium and Germany in 1914.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded application of the term to Communist Russia, again in the sense of the end of an era, comes in Vasily Rozanov's 1918 polemic The Apocalypse of Our Times, and it is possible that Churchill read it there following the publication of the book's English translation in 1920. The passage runs:\\r\\n\\r\\nWith clanging, creaking, and squeaking, an iron curtain is lowering over Russian History. \\"The performance is over.\\" The audience got up. \\"Time to put on your fur coats and go home.\\" We looked around, but the fur coats and homes were missing.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n(Incidentally, this same passage provides a definition of nihilism adopted by Raoul Vaneigem,[13] Guy Debord and other Situationists as the intention of situationist intervention.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first English-language use of the term iron curtain applied to the border of communist Russia in the sense of \\"an impenetrable barrier\\" was used in 1920 by Ethel Snowden, in her book Through Bolshevik Russia.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nG.K. Chesterton used the phrase in a 1924 essay in The Illustrated London News. Chesterton, while defending Distributism, refers to \\"that iron curtain of industrialism that has cut us off not only from our neighbours' condition, but even from our own past\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term also appears in the 1933 satirical novel England, Their England; used there to describe the way an artillery barrage protected the infantry from an enemy assault: \\"...the western sky was a blaze of yellow flame. The iron curtain was down\\". Sebastian Haffner used the metaphor in his book Germany: Jekyll & Hyde, published in London in 1940, in introducing his discussion of the Nazi rise to power in Germany in 1933: \\"Back then to March 1933. How, a moment before the iron curtain was wrung down on it, did the German political stage appear?\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll German theatres[when?] had to install an iron curtain (eiserner Vorhang) as an obligatory precaution to prevent the possibility of fire spreading from the stage to the rest of the theatre. Such fires were rather common because the decor often was very flammable. In case of fire, a metal wall would separate the stage from the theatre, secluding the flames to be extinguished by firefighters. Douglas Reed used this metaphor in his book Disgrace Abounding: \\"The bitter strife [in Yugoslavia between Serb unionists and Croat federalists] had only been hidden by the iron safety-curtain of the King's dictatorship\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nA May 1943 article in Signal, a Nazi illustrated propaganda periodical published in many languages, bore the title \\"Behind the Iron Curtain\\". It discussed \\"the iron curtain that more than ever before separates the world from the Soviet Union\\".[7] The German Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote in his weekly newspaper Das Reich that if the Nazis should lose the war a Soviet-formed \\"iron curtain\\" would arise because of agreements made by Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill at the Yalta Conference: \\"An iron curtain would fall over this enormous territory controlled by the Soviet Union, behind which nations would be slaughtered\\".[6][19]  The first recorded oral intentional mention of an Iron Curtain in the Soviet context occurred in a broadcast by Lutz von Krosigk to the German people on 2 May 1945: \\"In the East the iron curtain behind which, unseen by the eyes of the world, the work of destruction goes on, is moving steadily forward\\".[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nChurchill's first recorded use of the term \\"iron curtain\\" came in a 12 May 1945 telegram he sent to U.S. President Harry S. Truman regarding his concern about Soviet actions, stating \\"[a]n iron curtain is drawn down upon their front. We do not know what is going on behind\\".[21] He was further concerned about \\"another immense flight of the German population westward as this enormous Muscovite advance towards the centre of Europe\\".[21] Churchill concluded \\"then the curtain will descend again to a very large extent, if not entirely. Thus a broad land of many hundreds of miles of Russian-occupied territory will isolate us from Poland\\".[21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nChurchill repeated the words in a further telegram to President Truman on 4 June 1945, in which he protested against such a U.S. retreat to what was earlier designated as, and ultimately became, the U.S. occupation zone, saying the military withdrawal would bring \\"Soviet power into the heart of Western Europe and the descent of an iron curtain between us and everything to the eastward\\".[23] At the Potsdam Conference, Churchill complained to Stalin about an \\"iron fence\\" coming down upon the British Mission in Bucharest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first American print reference to the \\"Iron Curtain\\" occurred when C.L. Sulzberger of The New York Times first used it in a dispatch published on 23 July 1945. He had heard the term used by Vladko Ma?ek, a Croatian politician, a Yugoslav opposition leader who had fled his homeland for Paris in May 1945. Ma?ek told Sulzberger, \\"During the four years while I was interned by the Germans in Croatia I saw how the Partisans were lowering an iron curtain over Jugoslavia [Yugoslavia] so that nobody could know what went on behind it\\".[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term was first used in the British House of Commons by Churchill on 16 August 1945 when he stated \\"it is not impossible that tragedy on a prodigious scale is unfolding itself behind the iron curtain which at the moment divides Europe in twain\\".[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAllen Dulles used the term in a speech on 3 December 1945, referring to only Germany, following his conclusion that \\"in general the Russians are acting little better than thugs\\", had \\"wiped out all the liquid assets\\", and refused to issue food cards to emigrating Germans, leaving them \\"often more dead than alive\\". Dulles concluded that \\"[a]n iron curtain has descended over the fate of these people and very likely conditions are truly terrible. The promises at Yalta to the contrary, probably 8 to 10 million people are being enslaved\\".[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe antagonism between the Soviet Union and the West that came to be described as the \\"iron curtain\\" had various origins.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer of 1939, after conducting negotiations both with a British-French group and with Nazi Germany regarding potential military and political agreements,[26] the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the GermanÿSoviet Commercial Agreement (which provided for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials)[27][28] and the MolotovÿRibbentrop Pact (signed in late August 1939), named after the foreign secretaries of the two countries (Vyacheslav Molotov and Joachim von Ribbentrop), which included a secret agreement to split Poland and Eastern Europe between the two states.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviets thereafter occupied Eastern Poland (September 1939), Latvia (June 1940), Lithuania (1940), northern Romania (Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, late June 1940), Estonia (1940) and eastern Finland (March 1940). From August 1939, relations between the West and the Soviets deteriorated further when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany engaged in an extensive economic relationship by which the Soviet Union sent Germany vital oil, rubber, manganese and other materials in exchange for German weapons, manufacturing machinery and technology.[31][32] NaziÿSoviet trade ended in June 1941 when Germany broke the Pact and invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of World War II, Stalin determined[citation needed] to acquire a buffer area against Germany, with pro-Soviet states on its border in an Eastern bloc. Stalin's aims led to strained relations at the Yalta Conference (February 1945) and the subsequent Potsdam Conference (August 1945).[33] People in the West expressed opposition to Soviet domination over the buffer states, and the fear grew that the Soviets were building an empire that might be a threat to them and their interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nNonetheless, at the Potsdam Conference, the Allies assigned parts of Poland, Finland, Romania, Germany, and the Balkans to Soviet control or influence. In return, Stalin promised the Western Allies that he would allow those territories the right to national self-determination. Despite Soviet cooperation during the war, these concessions left many in the West uneasy. In particular, Churchill feared that the United States might return to its pre-war isolationism, leaving the exhausted European states unable to resist Soviet demands. (President Franklin D. Roosevelt had announced at Yalta that after the defeat of Germany, U.S. forces would withdraw from Europe within two years.)[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nWinston Churchill's \\"Sinews of Peace\\" address of 5 March 1946, at Westminster College, used the term \\"iron curtain\\" in the context of Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe:\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow.[35]\\r\\nMuch of the Western public still regarded the Soviet Union as a close ally in the context of the recent defeat of Nazi Germany and of Japan. Although not well received at the time, the phrase iron curtain gained popularity as a shorthand reference to the division of Europe as the Cold War strengthened. The Iron Curtain served to keep people in and information out, and people throughout the West eventually came to accept and use the metaphor.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nChurchill's \\"Sinews of Peace\\" address was to strongly criticise the Soviet Union's exclusive and secretive tension policies along with the Eastern Europe's state form, Police State (Polizeistaat). He expressed the Allied Nations' distrust of the Soviet Union after the World War II.  In September that year, US-Soviet Union cooperation collapsed due to the US disavowal of the Soviet Union's opinion on the German problem in the Stuttgart Council, and then followed the announcement by US President, Harry S. Truman, of a hard line anti-Soviet, anticommunist policy.  After that the phrase became more widely used as anti-Soviet term in the West.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, Churchill mentioned in his speech that regions under the Soviet Union's control were expanding their leverage and power without any restriction.  He asserted that in order to put a brake on this ongoing phenomenon, the commanding force of and strong unity between the UK and the US was necessary.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nStalin took note of Churchill's speech and responded in Pravda soon afterward.  He accused Churchill of warmongering, and defended Soviet \\"friendship\\" with eastern European states as a necessary safeguard against another invasion. He further accused Churchill of hoping to install right-wing governments in eastern Europe with the goal of agitating those states against the Soviet Union.[39] Andrei Zhdanov, Stalin's chief propagandist, used the term against the West in an August 1946 speech:[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nHard as bourgeois politicians and writers may strive to conceal the truth of the achievements of the Soviet order and Soviet culture, hard as they may strive to erect an iron curtain to keep the truth about the Soviet Union from penetrating abroad, hard as they may strive to belittle the genuine growth and scope of Soviet culture, all their efforts are foredoomed to failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Iron Curtain remained in place, much of Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe (except West Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Austria) found themselves under the hegemony of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union annexed:\\r\\n\\r\\nas Soviet Socialist Republics within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany effectively gave Moscow a free hand in much of these territories in the MolotovÿRibbentrop Pact of 1939, signed before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Soviet-annexed territories included:\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1945 and 1949 the Soviets converted the following areas into Soviet satellite states:\\r\\n\\r\\nSoviet-installed governments ruled the Eastern Bloc countries, with the exception of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which retained its full independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of European states to the east of the Iron Curtain developed their own international economic and military alliances, such as COMECON and the Warsaw Pact.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the west of the Iron Curtain, the countries of Western Europe, Northern Europe and Southern Europe ÿ along with Austria, West Germany, Liechtenstein and Switzerland ÿ operated market economies. With the exception of a period of fascism in Spain (until 1975) and Portugal (until 1974) and a military dictatorship in Greece (1967ÿ1974), democratic governments ruled these countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the states of Europe to the west of the Iron Curtain ÿ with the exception of neutral Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Malta and Republic of Ireland ÿ allied themselves with the United States and Canada within NATO. Economically, the European Community and the European Free Trade Association represented Western counterparts to COMECON. Most of the nominally neutral states were economically closer to the United States than they were to the Warsaw Pact.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1947 Harry Truman appointed General George Marshall as Secretary of State, scrapped Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) directive 1067 (which embodied the Morgenthau Plan) and supplanted it with JCS 1779, which decreed that an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\\"[51] Administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter five and a half weeks of negotiations, Molotov refused the demands and the talks were adjourned.[52] Marshall was particularly discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin, who expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems.[52] The United States concluded that a solution could not wait any longer.[52] In a 5 June 1947 speech,[53] Marshall announced a comprehensive program of American assistance to all European countries wanting to participate, including the Soviet Union and those of Eastern Europe, called the Marshall Plan.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nStalin opposed the Marshall Plan. He had built up the Eastern Bloc protective belt of Soviet controlled nations on his Western border,[54] and wanted to maintain this buffer zone of states combined with a weakened Germany under Soviet control.[55] Fearing American political, cultural and economic penetration, Stalin eventually forbade Soviet Eastern bloc countries of the newly formed Cominform from accepting Marshall Plan aid.[52] In Czechoslovakia, that required a Soviet-backed Czechoslovak coup d'tat of 1948,[56] the brutality of which shocked Western powers more than any event so far and set in a motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nRelations further deteriorated when, in January 1948, the U.S. State Department also published a collection of documents titled Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939 ÿ 1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office, which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of Nazi Germany[58][59] revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,[60][61] the 1939 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement,[60][62] and discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power.[63] In response, one month later, the Soviet Union published Falsifiers of History, a Stalin-edited and partially re-written book attacking the West.[58][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Marshall Plan, the introduction of a new currency to Western Germany to replace the debased Reichsmark and massive electoral losses for communist parties, in June 1948, the Soviet Union cut off surface road access to Berlin, initiating the Berlin Blockade, which cut off all non-Soviet food, water and other supplies for the citizens of the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin.[65] Because Berlin was located within the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, the only available methods of supplying the city were three limited air corridors.[66] A massive aerial supply campaign was initiated by the United States, Britain, France and other countries, the success of which caused the Soviets to lift their blockade in May 1949.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the conclusions of the Yalta Conference was that the western Allies would return all Soviet citizens who found themselves in their zones to the Soviet Union.[67] This affected the liberated Soviet prisoners of war (branded as traitors), forced laborers, anti-Soviet collaborators with the Germans, and anti-communist refugees.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nMigration from east to west of the Iron Curtain, except under limited circumstances, was effectively halted after 1950. Before 1950, over 15 million people (mainly ethnic Germans) emigrated from Soviet-occupied eastern European countries to the west in the five years immediately following World War II.[69] However, restrictions implemented during the Cold War stopped most East-West migration, with only 13.3 million migrations westward between 1950 and 1990.[70] More than 75% of those emigrating from Eastern Bloc countries between 1950 and 1990 did so under bilateral agreements for \\"ethnic migration.\\"[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 10% were refugees permitted to emigrate under the Geneva Convention of 1951.[70] Most Soviets allowed to leave during this time period were ethnic Jews permitted to emigrate to Israel after a series of embarrassing defections in 1970 caused the Soviets to open very limited ethnic emigrations.[71] The fall of the Iron Curtain was accompanied by a massive rise in European East-West migration.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Iron Curtain took physical shape in the form of border defenses between the countries of western and eastern Europe. These were some of the most heavily militarised areas in the world, particularly the so-called \\"inner German border\\" ÿ commonly known as die Grenze in German ÿ between East and West Germany. The inner German border was marked in rural areas by double fences made of steel mesh (expanded metal) with sharp edges, while near urban areas a high concrete barrier similar to the Berlin Wall was built. The installation of the Wall in 1961 brought an end to a decade during which the divided capital of divided Germany was one of the easiest places to move west across the Iron Curtain.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe barrier was always a short distance inside East German territory to avoid any intrusion into Western territory. The actual borderline was marked by posts and signs and was overlooked by numerous watchtowers set behind the barrier. The strip of land on the West German side of the barrier ÿ between the actual borderline and the barrier ÿ was readily accessible but only at considerable personal risk, because it was patrolled by both East and West German border guards.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral villages, many historic, were destroyed as they lay too close to the border, for example Erlebach. Shooting incidents were not uncommon, and a total of 28 East German border guards and several hundred civilians were killed between 1948 ÿ 1981 (some may have been victims of \\"friendly fire\\" by their own side).\\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere along the border between West and East, the defense works resembled those on the intra-German border. During the Cold War, the border zone in Hungary started 15 kilometres (9.3?mi) from the border. Citizens could only enter the area if they lived in the zone or had a passport valid for traveling out. Traffic control points and patrols enforced this regulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who lived within the 15 kilometres (9.3?mi) border-zone needed special permission to enter the area within 5 kilometres (3.1?mi) of the border. The area was very difficult to approach and heavily fortified. In the 1950s and 1960s, a double barbed-wire fence was installed 50 metres (160?ft) from the border. The space between the two fences were laden with land mines. The minefield was later replaced with an electric signal fence (about 1 kilometre (0.62?mi) from the border) and a barbed wire fence, along with guard towers and a sand strip to track border violations.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegular patrols sought to prevent escape attempts. They included cars and mounted units. Guards and dog patrol units watched the border 24/7 and were authorised to use their weapons to stop escapees. The wire fence nearest the actual border was irregularly displaced from the actual border, which was marked only by stones. Anyone attempting to escape would have to cross up to 400 metres (1,300?ft) before they could cross the actual border. Several escape attempts failed when the escapees were stopped after crossing the outer fence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn parts of Czechoslovakia, the border strip became hundreds of meters wide, and an area of increasing restrictions was defined as the border was approached. Only people with the appropriate government permissions were allowed to get close to the border.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviet Union built a fence along the entire border to Norway and Finland. It is located one or a few kilometres from the border, and has automatic alarms detecting if someone climbs over it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Greece, a highly militarised area called the \\"?ך ?\\" (\\"Surveillance Area\\") was created by the Greek Army along the Greek-Bulgarian border, subject to significant security-related regulations and restrictions. Inhabitants within this 25?km wide strip of land were forbidden to drive cars, own land bigger than 60 m2 and had to travel within the area with a special passport issued by Greek military authorities. Additionally, the Greek state used this area to encapsulate and monitor a non-Greek ethnic minority, the Pomaks, a Muslim and Bulgarian-speaking minority which was regarded as hostile to the interests of the Greek state during the Cold War because of its familiarity with their fellow Pomaks living on the other side of the Iron Curtain.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hungarian outer fence became the first part of the Iron Curtain to be dismantled. After the border fortifications were dismantled, a section was rebuilt for a formal ceremony. On 27 June 1989, the foreign ministers of Austria and Hungary, Alois Mock and Gyula Horn, ceremonially cut through the border defences separating their countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creation of these highly militarised no-man's lands led to de facto nature reserves and created a wildlife corridor across Europe; this helped the spread of several species to new territories. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, several initiatives are pursuing the creation of a European Green Belt nature preserve area along the Iron Curtain's former route. In fact, a long-distance cycling route along the length of the former border called the Iron Curtain Trail (ICT) exists as a project of the European Union and other associated nations. The trail is 6,800?km (4,200?mi) long and spans from Finland to Greece.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Iron Curtain\\" was only used for the fortified borders in Europe; it was not used for similar borders in Asia between communist and capitalist states (these were, for a time, dubbed the Bamboo Curtain). The border between North Korea and South Korea is very comparable to the former inner German border, particularly in its degree of militarisation, but it has never conventionally been considered part of any Iron Curtain.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a period of economic and political stagnation under Brezhnev and his immediate successors, the Soviet Union decreased its intervention in Eastern Bloc politics. Mikhail Gorbachev (General Secretary from 1985) decreased adherence to the Brezhnev Doctrine,[75] which held that if socialism were threatened in any state then other socialist governments had an obligation to intervene to preserve it, in favor of the \\"Sinatra Doctrine\\". He also initiated the policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (economic restructuring). A wave of Revolutions occurred throughout the Eastern Bloc in 1989.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1989 the People's Republic of Poland legalised the Solidarity organisation, which captured 99% of available parliamentary seats in June.[77] These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, inaugurated a series of peaceful anti-communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe[78][79][80] that eventually culminated in the fall of communism.[81][82]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 August 1989, more than 600 East Germans attending the \\"Pan-European Picnic\\" on the Hungarian border broke through the Iron Curtain and fled into Austria. Hungarian border guards had threatened to shoot anyone crossing the border, but when the time came, they did not intervene and allowed the people to cross. In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the Hungarian parliament adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legislation transformed Hungary from a People's Republic into the Republic of Hungary, guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government. In November 1989, following mass protests in East Germany and the relaxing of border restrictions in Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of East Berliners flooded checkpoints along the Berlin Wall, crossing into West Berlin.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the day after the mass crossings across the Berlin Wall, leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted.[84] In the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, following protests of an estimated half-million Czechoslovaks, the government permitted travel to the west and abolished provisions guaranteeing the ruling Communist party its leading role, preceding the Velvet Revolution.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Socialist Republic of Romania, on 22 December 1989, the Romanian military sided with protesters and turned on Communist ruler Nicolae Ceau?escu, who was executed after a brief trial three days later.[86] In the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, a new package of regulations went into effect on 3 July 1990 entitling all Albanians over the age of 16 to own a passport for foreign travel. Meanwhile, hundreds of Albanian citizens gathered around foreign embassies to seek political asylum and flee the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Berlin Wall officially remained guarded after 9 November 1989, although the inter-German border had become effectively meaningless. The official dismantling of the Wall by the East German military did not begin until June 1990. In July 1990, the day East Germany adopted the West German currency, all border-controls ceased and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl convinced Gorbachev to drop Soviet objections to a reunited Germany within NATO in return for substantial German economic aid to the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an Iron Curtain monument in the southern part of the Czech Republic at approximately 485232N 155229E? / ?48.8755N 15.87477E? / 48.8755; 15.87477?

There are interpretive signs in Czech and English that explain the history and significance of the Iron Curtain. This is the only surviving part of the fence in the Czech Republic, though several guard towers and bunkers can still be seen.

It stretches more than 3,500 kilometres (2,175?mi) from Dauan Island off the northeastern tip of Queensland, running the entire length of the eastern coastline through New South Wales, then into Victoria and turning west, before finally fading into the central plain at the Grampians in western Victoria. The width of the range varies from about 160?km (100?mi) to over 300?km (190?mi).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sharp rise between the coastal lowlands and the eastern uplands has affected Australia's climate, mainly due to orographic precipitation, and these areas of highest relief have revealed an impressive gorge country.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dividing Range does not consist of a single mountain range. It consists of a complex of mountain ranges, plateaus, upland areas and escarpments with an ancient and complex geological history. The physiographic division name for the landmass is called the East Australian Cordillera. In some places the terrain is relatively flat, consisting of very low hills.[4]  Typically the highlands range from 300?m to 1,600?m in height.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mountains and plateaus, which consist of limestones, sandstone, quartzite, schists and dolomite, have been created by faulting and folding processes.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crest of the range is defined by the watershed or boundary between the drainage basins of rivers which drain directly eastward into the Pacific Ocean, or southward into Bass Strait, and those rivers which drain into the MurrayÿDarling river system towards the west and south.[4] In the north, the rivers on the west side of the range drain towards the Gulf of Carpentaria.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe higher and more rugged parts of the \\"range\\" do not necessarily form part of the crest of the range, but may be branches and offshoots from it. The term \\"Great Dividing Range\\" may refer specifically to the watershed crest of the range, or to the entire upland complex including all of the hills and mountains between the east coast of Australia and the central plains and lowlands.  At some places it can be up to 400?km wide.[4] Notable ranges and other features which form part of the range complex have their own distinctive names.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Dividing Range was formed during the Carboniferous periodover 300 million years agowhen Australia collided with what are now parts of South America and New Zealand. The range has experienced significant erosion since. (See Geology of Australia.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor tens of thousands of years prior to British colonisation the ranges were home to various Aboriginal Australian nations and clans. Evidence remains in some places of their traditional way of life including decorated caves, campsites and trails used to travel between the coastal and inland regions. Many descendants of these nations still exist today and remain the traditional owners and custodians of their lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter British colonisation in 1788, the ranges were an obstacle to exploration and settlement by the British settlers. Although not high, parts of the highlands were very rugged. Crossing the Blue Mountains was particularly challenging due to the mistaken idea that the creeks should be followed rather than the ridges, and almost impenetrable, labyrinthine, sandstone mountains.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowing that local Aboriginal people already had established routes crossing the range and by making use of Aboriginal walking trails, a usable ridge-top route was finally discovered by Europeans directly westward from Sydney across the Blue Mountains to Bathurst by an expedition jointly led by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Charles Wentworth.[7][6] Towns in the Blue Mountains were later named after each of these men. This was the start of the development of the agricultural districts of inland New South Wales. A road was built to Blaxland by convicts within six months. Easier routes to inland New South Wales were discovered towards Goulburn to the southwest, and westwards from Newcastle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent explorations were made across and around the ranges by Allan Cunningham, John Oxley, Hamilton Hume, Paul Edmund Strzelecki, Ludwig Leichhardt and Thomas Mitchell. These explorers were mainly concerned with finding and appropriating good agricultural land.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the late 1830s the most fertile rangelands adjacent to the mountains ranges had been explored, appropriated from the traditional inhabitants and some settled. These included the Gippsland and Riverina regions in the south, up to the Liverpool Plains and the Darling Downs in the north.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious road and railway routes were subsequently established through many parts of the ranges, although many areas remain remote to this day. For example, in eastern Victoria there is only one major road crossing the highlands from north to south, the Great Alpine Road.\\r\\n\\r\\nParts of the highlands consisting of relatively flat and, by Australian standards, well-watered land were developed for agricultural and pastoral uses. Such areas include the Atherton Tableland and Darling Downs in Queensland, and the Northern Tablelands, Southern Highlands and Southern Tablelands in New South Wales. Other parts of the highlands are too rugged for agriculture and have been used for forestry.[citation needed] Many parts of the highlands which were not developed are now included in National Parks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of mainland Australia's alpine areas, including its highest mountain, Mount Kosciuszko (2,228 metres or 7,310 feet AHD), are part of this range, called the Main Range.[4] The highest areas in southern New South Wales and eastern Victoria are known as the Australian Alps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central core of the Great Dividing Range is dotted with hundreds of peaks and is surrounded by many smaller mountain ranges or spurs, canyons, valleys and plains of regional significance.  Some of the major plains include the High Plains of South-Eastern Australia, the Southern Highlands the Central Highlands and Bogong High Plains of Victoria. Other tablelands considered part of the Great Dividing Range are the Atherton Tableland, Canberra wine region and the Southern Tablelands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dandenong Ranges, Barrington Tops, Bunya Mountains, Blue Mountains, Liverpool Range, McPherson Ranges and the Moonbi Range are some of the smaller spurs and ranges that make up the greater dividing range. Other notable ranges and tablelands which form part of the Great Dividing Range include the Liverpool Range, Mount Royal Range and the Monaro District. Whilst some of the peaks of the highlands reach respectable heights of a little over 2,000 metres, the age of the range and its erosion mean that most of the mountains are not very steep, and virtually all peaks can be reached without mountaineering equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some areas, such as the Snowy Mountains, Victorian Alps, the Scenic Rim and the eastern escarpments of the New England region, the highlands form a significant barrier. The eastern escarpment is the site of many spectacular waterfalls which were formed by rivers plunging off the tablelands. In other areas the slopes are gentle and in places the range is barely perceptible.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWell known passes on the range include Coxs Gap, Cunninghams Gap, Dead Horse Gap, Nowlands Gap, and Spicers Gap.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor cities located on the upland areas of the range include Canberra, Toowoomba and the outer suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Cairns in north Queensland. Many towns and cities are located on the range, and also in lowland areas and foothills adjacent to the highlands. There is a strong natural history and cultural attachment to the Dividing Range region in towns and on many, sometimes remote landholdings.\\r\\nSome of the towns/cities located on the range include:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lower reaches are used for forestry, an activity that causes friction with conservationists. The range is also the source of virtually all of eastern Australia's water supply, both through runoff caught in dams, and throughout much of Queensland, through the Great Artesian Basin.\\r\\n\\r\\nValleys along the chain of mountains have yielded a water source for important reservoirs and water supply projects such as the Upper Nepean Scheme, Snowy Mountains Scheme and Warragamba Dam. The Bradfield Scheme has been mooted as a way to transport water from the tropics in coastal Queensland south to dryer regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Dividing Range creates the drainage basins of the Australian south-east coast drainage division and the Australian north-east coast drainage division, whose water flows to the east coast and into the Pacific Ocean, Tasman Sea, and Bass Strait with the westerly MurrayÿDarling basin which flow inland, away from the coast into the interior plains.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the rivers which flow west of the ranges includes the Condamine River, Flinders River, Herbert River, Lachlan River, Macdonald River, Macintyre River and Namoi River.[1] Rivers that flow north into the MurrayÿDarling Basin from Victoria include the Goulburn, Mitta Mitta, Kiewa, Ovens, King, Loddon and Campaspe rivers. Rivers that flow east into the Pacific Ocean include the Brisbane River, Burdekin River, Clarence River, Hastings River, Hawkesbury River, Hunter River, Macleay River, Mary River, Richmond River and the Shoalhaven River. Those that flow south, primarily through Victoria, include the Snowy, Cann, Tambo, Mitchell, Latrobe, Thomson, Yarra, Werribee, Hopkins and Glenelg rivers.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some high hill passes the range provides cool sites appropriate for vineyards.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engineers of early rail passages across the Great Dividing Range needed to find low sections of the range to cross, as well as suitable, low gradient paths up the mountains on either side. Rail passages include:\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of Australia's highways such as the Alpine Way, Great Alpine Road, Hume Highway, Northern Highway, Melba Highway, Maroondah Highway, Sunraysia Highway, Federal Highway, Great Western Highway, Capricorn Highway, Cunningham Highway, New England Highway, Oxley Highway, Warrego Highway, Waterfall Way, Thunderbolts Way, the Calder Highway, the Western Highway, and the Murray Valley Highway traverse parts of the range.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the range lies within a succession of national parks and other reserves, most of the national parks are listed below, there are almost double the amount of state forests;[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Great Dividing Range was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \\"location\\".[12]","input":"What mountain system runs along australia's eastern coast?"},{"output":"Rudyard Kipling","context":"The Jungle Book (1894) is a collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling. Most of the characters are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear, though a principal character is the boy or \\"man-cub\\" Mowgli, who is raised in the jungle by wolves. The stories are set in a forest in India; one place mentioned repeatedly is \\"Seonee\\" (Seoni), in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.\\r\\nA major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering, as in the life of Mowgli, echoing Kipling's own childhood. The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies, as well as Mowgli's. Another important theme is of law and freedom; the stories are not about animal behaviour, still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival, but about human archetypes in animal form. They teach respect for authority, obedience, and knowing one's place in society with \\"the law of the jungle\\", but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds, such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village. Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories, reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature.\\r\\nThe Jungle Book has remained popular, partly through its many adaptations for film and other media. Critics such as Swati Singh have noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his supposed imperialism[1] have admired the power of his storytelling.[1] The book has been influential in the scout movement, whose founder, Robert Baden-Powell, was a friend of Kipling's.[2] Percy Grainger composed his Jungle Book Cycle around quotations from the book.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stories were first published in magazines in 1893ÿ94. The original publications contain illustrations, some by the author's father, John Lockwood Kipling. Rudyard Kipling was born in India and spent the first six years of his childhood there. After about ten years in England, he went back to India and worked there for about six-and-a-half years. These stories were written when Kipling lived in Naulakha, the home he built in Dummerston, Vermont, in the United States.[3] There is evidence that Kipling wrote the collection of stories for his daughter Josephine, who died from pneumonia in 1899, aged 6; a first edition of the book with a handwritten note by the author to his young daughter was discovered at the National Trust's Wimpole Hall in Cambridgeshire, England, in 2010.[4]\\r\\nThe tales in the book (as well as those in The Second Jungle Book, which followed in 1895 and includes five further stories about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to teach moral lessons. The verses of \\"The Law of the Jungle\\", for example, lay down rules for the safety of individuals, families, and communities. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or \\"heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle\\".[5] Other readers have interpreted the work as allegories of the politics and society of the time.[6]\\r\\nIn a letter written and signed by Kipling in 1895, Kipling confesses to borrowing ideas and stories in the Jungle Book: \\"I am afraid that all that code in its outlines has been manufactured to meet 'the necessities of the case': though a little of it is bodily taken from (Southern) Esquimaux rules for the division of spoils,\\" Kipling wrote in the letter. \\"In fact, it is extremely possible that I have helped myself promiscuously but at present cannot remember from whose stories I have stolen.\\"[7]\\r\\nKipling lived in India as a child, and most of the stories[a] are evidently set there, though it is not entirely clear where. The Kipling Society notes that \\"Seonee\\" (Seoni, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh) is mentioned several times, and that the first Mowgli story, \\"In the Rukh\\", is set in a forest reserve somewhere in northern India. \\"Mowgli's Brothers\\" was positioned in the Aravalli hills of Rajasthan (northwestern India) in an early manuscript, later changed to Seonee, and Bagheera treks from \\"Oodeypore\\" (Udaipur), a journey of reasonable length to Aravalli but a long way from Seoni.[8] Seoni has a tropical savanna climate, with a dry and a rainy season. This is drier than a monsoon climate and does not support tropical rainforest.[9] Forested parks and reserves that claim to be associated with the stories include Kanha Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh,[10] and Pench National Park, near Seoni.[11] However, Kipling never visited the area.[8]\\r\\nThe book is arranged with a story in each chapter. Each story is followed by a poem that serves as an epigram.\\r\\nMany of the characters (marked *) are named simply for the Hindi names of their species: for example, Baloo is a transliteration of Hindi ???? Bhl, \\"bear\\".\\r\\nThe early editions were illustrated with drawings in the text by John Lockwood Kipling (Rudyard's father), and the American artists W. H. Drake and Paul Frenzeny.[15]\\r\\nThe book has appeared in over 500 print editions,[16] and over 100 audiobooks.[17] It has been translated into at least 36 languages.[18]\\r\\nCritics such as Harry Ricketts have observed that Kipling returns repeatedly to the theme of the abandoned and fostered child, recalling his own childhood feelings of abandonment. In his view, the enemy, Shere Khan, represents the \\"malevolent would-be foster-parent\\" who Mowgli in the end outwits and destroys, just as Kipling as a boy had to face Mrs Holloway in place of his parents. Ricketts writes that in \\"Mowgli's Brothers\\", the hero loses his human parents at the outset, and his wolf fosterers at the conclusion; and Mowgli is again rejected at the end of \\"Tiger! Tiger!\\", but each time is compensated by \\"a queue of would-be foster-parents\\" including the wolves, Baloo, Bagheera and Kaa. In Ricketts's view, the power that Mowgli has over all these characters who compete for his affection is part of the book's appeal to children.[19] The historian of India Philip Mason similarly emphasises the Mowgli myth, where the fostered hero, \\"the odd man out among wolves and men alike\\", eventually triumphs over his enemies. Mason notes that both Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal do much the same.[20]\\r\\nThe novelist Marghanita Laski argued that the purpose of the stories was not to teach about animals but to create human archetypes through the animal characters, with lessons of respect for authority. She noted that Kipling was a friend of the founder of the Scout Movement, Robert Baden-Powell, who based the junior scout \\"Wolf Cubs\\" on the stories, and that Kipling admired the movement.[19][21] Ricketts wrote that Kipling was obsessed by rules, a theme running throughout the stories and named explicitly as \\"the law of the jungle\\". Part of this, Ricketts supposed, was Mrs Holloway's evangelicalism, suitably transformed. The rules required obedience and \\"knowing your place\\", but also provided social relationships and \\"freedom to move between different worlds\\".[19] Sandra Kemp observed that the law may be highly codified, but that the energies are also lawless, embodying the part of human nature which is \\"floating, irresponsible and self-absorbed\\".[19][22] There is a duality between the two worlds of the village and the jungle, but Mowgli, like Mang the bat, can travel between the two.[19]\\r\\nThe novelist and critic Angus Wilson noted that Kipling's law of the jungle was \\"far from Darwinian\\", since no attacks were allowed at the water-hole, even in drought. In Wilson's view, the popularity of the Mowgli stories is thus not literary but moral: the animals can follow the law easily, but Mowgli has human joys and sorrows, and the burden of making decisions.[19][23] Kipling's biographer, Charles Carrington, argued that the \\"fables\\" about Mowgli illustrate truths directly, as successful fables do, through the character of Mowgli himself; through his \\"kindly mentors\\", Bagheera and Baloo; through the repeated failure of the \\"bully\\" Shere Khan; through the endless but useless talk of the Bandar-log; and through the law, which makes the jungle \\"an integrated whole\\" while enabling Mowgli's brothers to live as the \\"Free People\\".[24]\\r\\nThe academic Jan Montefiore commented on the book's balance of law and freedom that \\"You don't need to invoke Jacqueline Rose on the adult's dream of the child's innocence or Perry Nodelman's theory of children's literature colonising its readers' minds with a double fantasy of the child as both noble savage and embryo good citizen, to see that the Jungle Books .. give their readers a vicarious experience of adventure both as freedom and as service to a just State\\".[25]\\r\\nSayan Mukherjee, writing for the Book Review Circle, calls The Jungle Book \\"One of the most enjoyable books of my childhood and even in adulthood, highly informative as to the outlook of the British on their 'native population'.\\"[26]\\r\\nThe academic Jopi Nyman argued in 2001 that the book formed part of the construction of \\"colonial English national identity\\"[27] within Kipling's \\"imperial project\\".[27] In Nyman's view, nation, race and class are mapped out in the stories, contributing to \\"an imagining of Englishness as a site of power and racial superiority.\\"[27] Nyman suggested that The Jungle Book's monkeys and snakes represent \\"colonial animals\\"[27] and \\"racialized Others\\"[27] within the Indian jungle, whereas the White Seal promotes \\"'truly English' identities in the nationalist allegory\\"[27] of that story.[27]\\r\\nSwati Singh, in his Secret History of the Jungle Book, notes that the tone is like that of Indian folklore, fable-like, and that critics have speculated that the Kipling may have heard similar stories from his Hindu bearer and his Portuguese ayah (nanny) during his childhood in India. Singh observes, too, that Kipling wove \\"magic and fantasy\\" into the stories for his daughter Josephine, and that even critics reading Kipling for signs of imperialism could not help admiring the power of his storytelling.[1]\\r\\nThe Jungle Book came to be used as a motivational book by the Cub Scouts, a junior element of the Scouting movement. This use of the book's universe was approved by Kipling at the request of Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouting movement, who had originally asked for the author's permission for the use of the Memory Game from Kim in his scheme to develop the morale and fitness of working-class youths in cities. Akela, the head wolf in The Jungle Book, has become a senior figure in the movement; the name is traditionally adopted by the leader of each Cub Scout pack.[2]\\r\\nThe Jungle Book has been adapted many times in a wide variety of media. In literature, Robert Heinlein wrote the Hugo Award-winning science fiction novel, Stranger in a Strange Land (1961), when his wife, Virginia, suggested a new version of The Jungle Book, but with a child raised by Martians instead of wolves.[28][29] Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book (2008) is inspired by The Jungle Book. It follows a baby boy who is found and brought up by the dead in a cemetery. It has many scenes that can be traced to Kipling, but with Gaiman's dark twist.[30]\\r\\nIn music, the Jungle Book cycle (1958) was written by the Australian composer Percy Grainger, an avid Kipling reader. It consists of quotations from the book, set as choral pieces and solos for soprano, tenor or baritone.[31] The French composer Charles Koechlin wrote several symphonic works inspired by the book. BBC Radio broadcast an adaptation on 14 February 1994 and released it as a BBC audiobook in 2008.[32] It was directed by Chris Wallis with Nisha K. Nayar as Mowgli, Eartha Kitt as Kaa, Freddie Jones as Baloo, and Jonathan Hyde as Bagheera. The music was by John Mayer.[33]\\r\\nThe book's text has been adapted for younger readers with comic book adaptations such as DC Comics Elseworlds' story, \\"Superman: The Feral Man of Steel\\", in which an infant Supermanis raised by wolves, while Bagheera, Akela, and Shere Khan make appearances.[34] Marvel Comics published several adaptations by Mary Jo Duffy and Gil Kane in the pages of Marvel Fanfare (vol. 1). These were collected in the one-shot Marvel Illustrated: The Jungle Book (2007).[35] Bill Willingham's comic book series, Fables, features The Jungle Book's Mowgli, Bagheera, and Shere Khan.[36]\\r\\nMany films have been based on one or another of Kipling's stories, including Elephant Boy (1937),[37] the Russian: ̶ (Mowgli) published as Adventures of Mowgli in the US, an animation released between 1967 and 1971, and combined into a single 96-minute feature film in 1973;[38] Chuck Jones's made for-TV cartoons Rikki-Tikki-Tavi (1975),[39] The White Seal (1975),[40] and Mowgli's Brothers (1976).[41] Many films, too, have been made of the book as a whole, such as Zoltn Korda's 1942 film,[42] Disney's 1967 animation[43] and its 2016 remake,[44] and the 1989 Japanese anime Jungle Book Shonen Mowgli.[45]\\r\\nStuart Paterson wrote a stage adaptation in 2004, first produced by the Birmingham Old Rep in 2004 and published in 2007 by Nick Hern Books.[46]","input":"Who was the author of jungle book answer?"},{"output":"Amaravati","context":"Amaravati is the de facto capital city of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.[6] The planned city is located on the southern banks of the Krishna river in Guntur district, within the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region.[2][7][8] The word \\"Amaravati\\" derives its name from the historical Amaravathi Temple town, the ancient capital of the Telugu Rulers of the Satavahana dynasty.[9] The foundation stone was laid on 22 October 2015, at Uddandarayunipalem area by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.[10] The metropolitan area of Guntur and Vijayawada are the major conurbations of Amaravati.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Amaravati translates as the place for immortals.[9][12]\\r\\nThe present capital area has its own historical significance of having recorded its first ever legislation 2,200 years ago.[13] As per the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act (2014), Hyderabad became the capital of the then newly formed state of Telangana, post bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh.

The culmination of the voyage was the signing of the Mayflower Compact, an event which established a rudimentary form of democracy, with each member contributing to the welfare of the community.[3] There was a second ship named Mayflower that made the London to Plymouth, Massachusetts voyage several times.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pilgrim ship Mayflower was a square rig with a beakhead bow and high, castle-like structures fore and aft that served to protect the ship's crew and the main deck from the elementsdesigns that were typical with English merchant ships of the early 17th century. Her stern carried a 30-foot high, square aft-castle which made the ship extremely difficult to sail against the wind and unable to sail well against the North Atlantic's prevailing westerlies, especially in the fall and winter of 1620, and the voyage from England to America took more than two months as a result. The Mayflower's return trip to London in AprilÿMay 1621 took less than half that time, with the same strong winds now blowing in the direction of the voyage.[4][5]\\r\\nNo dimensions of her hull can be stated exactly, since this was many years before such measurements were standardized. She probably measured about 100 feet (30 m) in length from the forward end at the beak of her prow to the tip of her stern superstructure aft. She was about 25 feet (7.6 m) at her widest point, with the bottom of her keel about 12 feet (3.6 m) below the waterline. William Bradford estimated that Mayflower had a cargo capacity of 180 tons. Surviving records from that time indicate that she could certainly accommodate 180 casks of wine in her cargo hold. The casks were great barrels holding hundreds of gallons of Bordeaux wine each.[5]\\r\\nThis ship traditionally was heavily armed while on trading routes around Europe, due to the possibility of encountering pirates and privateers of all types. And with its armament, the ship and crew could easily be conscripted by the English monarch at any time in case of conflict with other nations.[6] By 1620, the Mayflower was aging, nearing the end of the usual 15-year working life of an English merchant ship in that era.\\r\\nThe general layout of the ship was as follows:\\r\\nAft on the main deck in the stern was the cabin for Master Christopher Jones, measuring about ten by seven feet (3 m G 2.1 m). Forward of that was the steerage room which housed a whipstaff (tiller extension) for sailing control, rather than a wheel as in later ships. Also there was the ship's compass and probably also berths for the ship's officers. Forward of the steerage room was the capstan, a vertical axle used to pull in ropes or cables. Far forward on the main deck, just aft of the bow, was the forecastle space where the ship's cook prepared meals for the crew; it may also have been where the ship's sailors slept.[6]\\r\\nThe poop deck was above the cabin of Master Jones, on the ship's highest level above the stern on the aft castle. The poop house was on this deck, which may have been for passengers' use either for sleeping or cargo. On normal merchant ships, this space was probably a chart room or a cabin for the master's mates.[8][9]\\r\\nThe gun deck was where the passengers resided during the voyage, in a space measuring about 50 by 25 feet (15.2?m G?7.6?m) with a five-foot (1.5?m) overhead (ceiling). But it was also a dangerous place in conflict, as it had port and starboard gun ports from which cannon could be run out to fire on the enemy. The gun room was in the stern area of the gun deck, to which passengers had no access due to it being the storage space for powder and ammunition for the ship's cannons and any other weapons belonging to the ship. The gun room might also house a pair of stern chasers, small cannons used to fire out the stern of the ship. Forward on the gun deck in the bow area was a windlass, equipment similar in function to the capstan in steerage, which was used to raise and lower the ship's main anchor. There were no stairs for the passengers on the gun deck to go up through the gratings to the main deck. To get up to the main deck, passengers were required to climb a wooden or rope ladder.[8][9]\\r\\nThere was no facility for a latrine or privy on the Mayflower, and ship's crew had to fend for themselves in that regard. Gun deck passengers most likely used a bucket as a chamber pot, affixed to the deck or bulkhead to keep it from being jostled at sea.[9][10]\\r\\nThe largest gun was a minion cannon which was brass, weighed about 1,200 pounds (545?kg), and could shoot a 3.5 pound (1.6?kg) cannonball almost a mile (1,600 m). The Mayflower also had on board a saker cannon of about 800 pounds (360?kg), and two base cannons that weighed about 200 pounds (90?kg) which shot a 3 to 5 ounce ball (85ÿ140 g). She carried at least ten pieces of ordnance on the port and starboard sides of her gun deck: seven cannons for long range purposes, and three smaller guns often fired from the stern at close quarters that were filled with musket balls. Later at New Plymouth, Mayflower Master Jones unloaded four of the pieces to help fortify the colony against invaders, and would not have done so unless he was comfortable with the armament that he still had on board.[5]\\r\\nBelow the gun deck was the cargo hold where the passengers kept most of their food stores and other supplies. Other items included most of their clothing and bedding. The hold also stored the passengers' personal weapons and military equipment ÿ armor, muskets, gunpowder, and shot, as well as swords and bandoliers. It also stored all the tools that the Pilgrims would need, as well as all the equipment and utensils needed to prepare meals in the New World. It is also known that some Pilgrims loaded trade goods on board, including Isaac Allerton, William Mullins, and possibly others; these also most likely were stored in the cargo hold.[10]\\r\\nIt is not known when and where the Mayflower was built, but it is likely that she was launched at Harwich in the county of Essex, England. She was designated as \\"of Harwich\\" in the Port Books of 1609ÿ11, although later known as \\"of London\\". Harwich was also the birthplace of Mayflower master Christopher Jones about 1570.[11]\\r\\nCaptain Jones became master of the Mayflower 11 years prior to the Pilgrims' voyage, sailing the ship cross-Channel taking English woolens to France and bringing French wine back to London. He had also transported hats, hemp, Spanish salt, hops, and vinegar to Norway, and may have taken the Mayflower whaling in the North Atlantic in the Greenland area, and she had traveled to Mediterranean ports. By that time, Jones was one of the owners of the ship, along with Christopher Nichols, Robert Child, and Thomas Short. In 1620, Jones and Robert Child still owned their quarter shares in the ship, and it was from them that Thomas Weston chartered her in the summer of 1620 to undertake the Pilgrim voyage. Weston had a significant role in the Mayflower voyage due to his membership in the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, and he eventually traveled to the Plymouth Colony himself.[4][12][13]\\r\\nThere were 26 vessels bearing the name Mayflower in the Port Books of England during the reign of James I (1603ÿ1625), and the reason for this popularity of the name has never been found.[14] One particular Mayflower that has caused historical confusion was a ship that was partly owned by John Vassall and was outfitted for Queen Elizabeth in 1588, during the time of the Spanish Armada. However, there are no records of Vassall's Mayflower after 1594.[15] The identity of Captain Jones's Mayflower is based on records from her home port, her tonnage (est. 180ÿ200 tons), and the master's name in 1620 in order to avoid confusion with the many other Mayflower ships.[14]\\r\\nRecords dating from August 1609 first note Christopher Jones as master and part owner of the Mayflower when his ship was chartered for a voyage from London to Trondheim in Norway and back to London. The ship lost an anchor on her return due to bad weather, and she made short delivery of her cargo of herrings. Litigation resulted, and this was still proceeding in 1612.\\r\\nChristopher Jones is described in a document of January 1611 as being \\"of Harwich\\", and his ship is called the Mayflower of Harwich (in the county of Essex). Records of Jones's ship Mayflower show that the ship was twice on the Thames at London in 1613, once in July and again in October and November. Records of 1616 again state that Jones's ship was on the Thames, carrying a cargo of wine, which suggests that the ship had recently been on a voyage to France, Spain, Portugal, the Canaries, or some other wine-producing land.\\r\\nAfter 1616, there is no further record which specifically relates to Jones's Mayflower until 1624. This is unusual for a ship trading to London, as it would not usually disappear from the records for such a long time. And no Admiralty court document can be found relating to the pilgrim fathers' voyage of 1620, although this might be due to the unusual way in which the transfer of the pilgrims was arranged from Leyden to New England, or some of the records of the period may have been lost.\\r\\nApproximately 65 passengers embarked the Mayflower in the middle of July 1620 at its home port at Rotherhithe, Surrey, on the River Thames. The ship then proceeded down the Thames into the English Channel and then on to the south coast of England to anchor at Southampton Water. The Mayflower waited there for a rendezvous on July 22 with the Speedwell. Speedwell was coming from Holland with English separatist Puritans, members of the Leiden congregation who had been living in Holland to escape religious persecution in England.\\r\\nThe two ships set sail for America around August 5, but the Speedwell sprang a leak shortly after, and the two ships were brought into Dartmouth for repairs. They made a new start after the repairs, and they were more than 200 miles (320?km) beyond Land's End at the southwestern tip of England when Speedwell sprang another leak. It was now early September, and they had no choice but to abandon the Speedwell and make a determination on her passengers. This was a dire event, as the ship had wasted vital funds and was considered very important to the future success of their settlement in America. Both ships returned to Plymouth, where some of the Speedwell passengers joined the Mayflower and others returned to Holland. The Mayflower then continued on her voyage to America, and the Speedwell was sold soon afterwards.\\r\\nMayflower carried 102 passengers plus a crew of 25 to 30 officers and men, bringing the total to approximately 130.[16] According to William Bradford, Speedwell was refitted and \\"made many voyages... to the great profit of her owners.\\" Bradford later implied that the Speedwell's master used \\"cunning and deceit\\" to abort the voyage, possibly by causing leaks in the ship and motivated by a fear of starving to death in America.[17]\\r\\nIn early September, western gales began to make the North Atlantic a dangerous place for sailing. The Mayflower's provisions were already quite low when departing Southampton, and they became lower still by delays of more than a month. The passengers had been on board the ship for this entire time, and they were quite worn out and in no condition for a very taxing, lengthy Atlantic journey cooped up in cramped spaces in a small ship. But the Mayflower sailed from Plymouth on September 6, 1620 with what Bradford called \\"a prosperous wind\\".[18]\\r\\nAboard the Mayflower were many stores that supplied the pilgrims with the essentials needed for their journey and future lives. It is assumed that they carried tools and weapons, including cannon, shot, and gunpowder, as well as some live animals, including dogs, sheep, goats, and poultry. Horses and cattle came later. The ship also carried two boats: a long boat and a \\"shallop\\", a 21-foot boat powered by oars or sails. She also carried 12 artillery pieces (eight minions and four sakers), as the Pilgrims feared that they might need to defend themselves against enemy European forces, as well as the natives.[19]\\r\\nThe passage was a miserable one, with huge waves constantly crashing against the ship's topside deck until a key structural support timber fractured. The passengers had already suffered agonizing delays, shortages of food, and other shortages, and they were now called upon to provide assistance to the ship's carpenter in repairing the fractured main support beam. This was repaired with the use of a metal mechanical device called a jackscrew, which had been loaded on board to help in the construction of settler homes. It was now used to secure the beam to keep it from cracking further, making the ship seaworthy enough.[19][20]\\r\\nThe crew of the Mayflower had some devices to assist them en route, such as a compass for navigation, as well as a log and line system to measure speed in nautical miles per hour (knots). Time was measured with the ancient method of an hourglass.\\r\\nOn November 9, 1620, they sighted present-day Cape Cod. They spent several days trying to sail south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, where they had obtained permission to settle from the Company of Merchant Adventurers. However, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, well north of the intended area, where they anchored on November 11. The settlers wrote and signed the Mayflower Compact after the ship dropped anchor at Cape Cod, in what is now Provincetown Harbor, in order to establish legal order and to quell increasing strife within the ranks.[21][22][23][24]\\r\\nOn Monday, November 27, an exploring expedition was launched under the direction of Capt. Christopher Jones to search for a suitable settlement site. As master of the Mayflower, Jones was not required to assist in the search, but he apparently thought it in his best interest to assist the search expedition. There were 34 persons in the open shallop: 24 passengers and 10 sailors. They were obviously not prepared for the bitter winter weather which they encountered on their reconnoiter, the Mayflower passengers not being accustomed to winter weather much colder than back home. They were forced to spend the night ashore due to the bad weather which they encountered, ill-clad in below-freezing temperatures with wet shoes and stockings that became frozen. Bradford wrote, \\"Some of our people that are dead took the original of their death here\\" on that expedition.[25]\\r\\nThe settlers explored the snow-covered area and discovered an empty native village, now known as Corn Hill in Truro. The curious settlers dug up some artificially made mounds, some of which stored corn, while others were burial sites. The modern writer Nathaniel Philbrick claims that the settlers stole the corn and looted and desecrated the graves,[26] sparking friction with the locals.[27] Philbrick goes on to say that they explored the area of Cape Cod for several weeks as they moved down the coast to what is now Eastham, and he claims that the Pilgrims were looting and stealing native stores as they went.[28] He then writes about how they decided to relocate to Plymouth after a difficult encounter with the Nausets at First Encounter Beach in December 1620.\\r\\nHowever, the only contemporary account of events, William Bradford's History of Plymouth Plantation, records only that the pilgrims took \\"some\\" of the corn, to show to others back at the boat, leaving the rest. They later took what they needed from another store of grain, but paid the natives back in six months, and there was no resulting conflict.\\r\\nAlso there was found more of their corn and of their beans of various colors; the corn and beans they brought away, purposing to give them full satisfaction when they should meet with any of them as, about some six months afterward they did, to their good content.[29]\\r\\nDuring the winter, the passengers remained on board the Mayflower, suffering an outbreak of a contagious disease described[by whom?] as a mixture of scurvy, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. When it ended, only 53 passengers remainedjust over half; half of the crew died, as well. In the spring, they built huts ashore, and the passengers disembarked from the Mayflower on March 21, 1621.\\r\\nThe settlers decided to mount \\"our great ordnances\\" on the hill overlooking the settlement in late February 1621, due to the fear of attack by the natives. Christopher Jones supervised the transportation of the \\"great guns\\"about six iron cannons that ranged between four and eight feet (1.2 to 2.4 m) in length and weighed almost half a ton. The cannon were able to hurl iron balls 3.5 inches (8.9?cm) in diameter as far as 1,700 yards (1.5?km). This action made what was no more than a ramshackle village almost into a well-defended fortress.[30]\\r\\nJones had originally planned to return to England as soon as the Pilgrims found a settlement site. But his crew members began to be ravaged by the same diseases that were felling the Pilgrims, and he realized that he had to remain in Plymouth Harbor \\"till he saw his men began to recover.\\"[31] The Mayflower lay in New Plymouth harbor through the winter of 1620ÿ21, then set sail for England on April 5, 1621, her empty hold ballasted with stones from the Plymouth Harbor shore. As with the Pilgrims, her sailors had been decimated by disease. Jones had lost his boatswain, his gunner, three quartermasters, the cook, and more than a dozen sailors.\\r\\nThe Mayflower made excellent time on her voyage back to England. The westerly winds that had buffeted her coming out pushed her along going home, and she arrived at the home port of Rotherhithe in London on May 6, 1621,[32] less than half the time that it had taken her to sail to America.\\"[33]\\r\\nJones died after coming back from a voyage to France on March 5, 1622, at about age 52. For the next two years, the Mayflower lay at her berth in Rotherhithe, not far from Jones' grave at St. Mary's church. By 1624, she was no longer useful as a ship; her subsequent fate is unknown, but she was probably broken up about that time.[34]\\r\\nSome families traveled together, while some men came alone, leaving families in England and Leiden. Two wives on board were pregnant; Elizabeth Hopkins gave birth to son Oceanus while at sea, and Susanna White gave birth to son Peregrine in late November while the ship was anchored in Cape Cod Harbor. He is historically recognized as the first European child born in the New England area. One child died during the voyage, and there was one stillbirth during the construction of the colony.\\r\\nAccording to the Mayflower passenger list, just over a third of the passengers were Puritan Separatists who sought to break away from the established Church of England and create a society along the lines of their religious ideals. Others were hired hands, servants, or farmers recruited by London merchants, all originally destined for the Colony of Virginia. Four of this latter group of passengers were small children given into the care of Mayflower pilgrims as indentured servants. The Virginia Company began the transportation of children in 1618.[35] Until relatively recently, the children were thought to be orphans, foundlings, or involuntary child labor. At that time, children were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as laborers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were overridden by the Privy Council.[36][37] For instance it was proven that the four More children were sent to America because they were deemed illegitimate.[38] Three of the four More children died in the first winter in the New World, but Richard lived to be approximately 81, dying in Salem, probably in 1695 or 1696.[39]\\r\\nThe passengers mostly slept and lived in the low-ceilinged great cabins and on the main deck, which was 75 by 20 feet large (23 m G 6 m) at most. The cabins were thin-walled and extremely cramped, and the total area was 25?ft by 15?ft (7.6 m G 4.5 m) at its largest. Below decks, any person over five feet (150?cm) tall would be unable to stand up straight. The maximum possible space for each person would have been slightly less than the size of a standard single bed.[40]\\r\\nPassengers would pass the time by reading by candlelight or playing cards and games such as Nine Men's Morris.[19] Meals on board were cooked by the firebox, which was an iron tray with sand in it on which a fire was built. This was risky because it was kept in the waist of the ship. Passengers made their own meals from rations that were issued daily and food was cooked for a group at a time.[40]\\r\\nUpon arrival in America, the harsh climate and scarcity of fresh food were exacerbated by the shortness of provisions due to the delay in departure. Living in these extremely close and crowded quarters, several passengers developed scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. At the time the use of lemons or limes to counter this disease was unknown, and the usual dietary sources of vitamin C in fruits and vegetables had been depleted, since these fresh foods could not be stored for long periods without their becoming rotten. Passengers who developed scurvy experienced symptoms such as bleeding gums, teeth falling out, and stinking breath.[41]\\r\\nPassengers consumed large amounts of alcohol such as beer with meals. This was known to be safer than water, which often came from polluted sources causing diseases. All food and drink was stored in barrels known as \\"hogsheads\\".[41]\\r\\nThe passenger William Mullins brought 126 pairs of shoes and 13 pairs of boots in his luggage. Other items included oiled leather and canvas suits, stuff gowns and leather and stuff breeches, shirts, jerkins, doublets, neckcloths, hats and caps, hose, stockings, belts, piece goods, and haberdasherie. At his death, his estate consisted of extensive footwear and other items of clothing, and made his daughter Priscilla and her husband John Alden quite prosperous.[19][42][43]\\r\\nNo cattle or beasts of draft or burden were brought on the journey, but there were pigs, goats, and poultry. Some passengers brought family pets such as cats and birds. Peter Browne took his large bitch mastiff, and John Goodman brought along his spaniel.[19]\\r\\nAccording to author Charles Banks, the officers and crew of the Mayflower consisted of a captain, four mates, four quartermasters, surgeon, carpenter, cooper, cooks, boatswains, gunners, and about 36 men before the mast, making a total of about 50. The entire crew stayed with the Mayflower in Plymouth through the winter of 1620ÿ1621, and about half of them died during that time. The remaining crewmen returned to England on the Mayflower, which sailed for London on April 5, 1621.[44][45]\\r\\nBanks states that the crew totaled 36 men before the mast and 14 officers, making a total of 50. Nathaniel Philbrick estimates between 20 and 30 sailors in her crew whose names are unknown. Nick Bunker states that Mayflower had a crew of at least 17 and possibly as many as 30. Caleb Johnson states that the ship carried a crew of about 30 men, but the exact number is unknown.[2][46][47][48]\\r\\nThree of Mayflower's owners applied to the Admiralty court for an appraisal of the ship on May 4, 1624, two years after Captain Jones' death in 1622; one of these applicants was Jones' widow Mrs. Josian (Joan) Jones. This appraisal probably was made to determine the valuation of the ship for the purpose of settling the estate of its late master. The appraisal was made by four mariners and shipwrights of Rotherhithe, home and burial place of Captain Jones, where the Mayflower was apparently then lying in the Thames at London. The appraisement is extant and provides information on ship's gear on board at that time, as well as equipment such as muskets and other arms. The ship may have been laid up since Jones' death and allowed to get out of repair, as that is what the appraisal indicates.[14][73] The vessel was valued at one hundred and twenty-eight pounds, eight shillings, and fourpence.[74]\\r\\nWhat finally became of the Mayflower is an unsettled issue. Charles Edward Banks, an English historian of the Pilgrim ship, claims that the ship was finally broken up, with her timbers used in the construction of a barn at Jordans village in Buckinghamshire. Tradition claims that this barn still exists as the Mayflower Barn, located within the grounds of Old Jordan in South Buckinghamshire. In 1624, Thomas Russell supposedly added to part of a farmhouse already there with timbers from a ship, believed to be from the Pilgrim ship Mayflower, bought from a shipbreaker's yard in Rotherhithe. The well-preserved structure was a tourist attraction, receiving visitors each year from all over the world and particularly from America, but it is now privately owned and not open to the public.[14]\\r\\nAnother ship called the Mayflower made a voyage from London to Plymouth Colony in 1629 carrying 35 passengers, many from the Pilgrim congregation in Leiden that organized the first voyage. This was not the same ship that made the original voyage with the first settlers. This voyage began in May and reached Plymouth in August. This ship also made the crossing from England to America in 1630 (as part of the Winthrop Fleet), 1633, 1634, and 1639. It attempted the trip again in 1641, departing London in October of that year under master John Cole, with 140 passengers bound for Virginia. It never arrived. On October 18, 1642, a deposition was made in England regarding the loss.[75]\\r\\nThe Pilgrim ship Mayflower has a famous place in American history as a symbol of early European colonization of the future United States.[76]\\r\\nThe main record for the voyage of the Mayflower and the disposition of the Plymouth Colony comes from the letters and journal of William Bradford, who was a guiding force and later the governor of the colony.\\r\\nThe 400th anniversary of the Mayflower sailing will take place in 2020.

An international survey of psychiatrists in 66 countries compared the use of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV; it found the former was more often used for clinical diagnosis while the latter was more valued for research.[10]\\r\\nDSM-5, and the abbreviations for all previous editions, are registered trademarks owned by the APA.[5][11]\\r\\nThe initial impetus for developing a classification of mental disorders in the United States was the need to collect statistical information. The first official attempt was the 1840 census, which used a single category: \\"idiocy/insanity\\". Three years later, the American Statistical Association made an official protest to the U.S. House of Representatives, stating that \\"the most glaring and remarkable errors are found in the statements respecting nosology, prevalence of insanity, blindness, deafness, and dumbness, among the people of this nation\\", pointing out that in many towns African-Americans were all marked as insane, and calling the statistics essentially useless.\\r\\nThe Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane was formed in 1844, changing its name in 1892 to the American Medico-Psychological Association, and in 1921 to the present American Psychiatric Association (APA).\\r\\nEdward Jarvis and later Francis Amasa Walker helped expand the census, from 2 volumes in 1870 to 25 volumes in 1880. Frederick H. Wines was appointed to write a 582-page volume called Report on the Defective, Dependent, and Delinquent Classes of the Population of the United States, As Returned at the Tenth Census (June 1, 1880) (published 1888). Wines used seven categories of mental illness: dementia, dipsomania (uncontrollable craving for alcohol), epilepsy, mania, melancholia, monomania and paresis. These categories were also adopted by the Association.[12]\\r\\nIn 1917, together with the National Commission on Mental Hygiene (now Mental Health America), the APA developed a new guide for mental hospitals called the Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane. This included 22 diagnoses and would be revised several times by the APA over the years.[13] Along with the New York Academy of Medicine, the APA also provided the psychiatric nomenclature subsection of the US general medical guide, the Standard Classified Nomenclature of Disease, referred to as the Standard.[14]\\r\\nWorld War II saw the large-scale involvement of US psychiatrists in the selection, processing, assessment, and treatment of soldiers. This moved the focus away from mental institutions and traditional clinical perspectives. A committee headed by psychiatrist Brigadier General William C. Menninger developed a new classification scheme called Medical 203, that was issued in 1943 as a War Department Technical Bulletin under the auspices of the Office of the Surgeon General.[15] The foreword to the DSM-I states the US Navy had itself made some minor revisions but \\"the Army established a much more sweeping revision, abandoning the basic outline of the Standard and attempting to express present day concepts of mental disturbance. This nomenclature eventually was adopted by all Armed Forces\\", and \\"assorted modifications of the Armed Forces nomenclature [were] introduced into many clinics and hospitals by psychiatrists returning from military duty.\\" The Veterans Administration also adopted a slightly modified version of Medical 203.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1949, the World Health Organization published the sixth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), which included a section on mental disorders for the first time. The foreword to DSM-1 states this \\"categorized mental disorders in rubrics similar to those of the Armed Forces nomenclature.\\" An APA Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics was empowered to develop a version specifically for use in the United States, to standardize the diverse and confused usage of different documents. In 1950, the APA committee undertook a review and consultation. It circulated an adaptation of Medical 203, the VA system, and the Standard's Nomenclature to approximately 10% of APA members. 46% replied, of which 93% approved, and after some further revisions (resulting in its being called DSM-I), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was approved in 1951 and published in 1952. The structure and conceptual framework were the same as in Medical 203, and many passages of text were identical.[15] The manual was 130 pages long and listed 106 mental disorders.[16] These included several categories of \\"personality disturbance\\", generally distinguished from \\"neurosis\\" (nervousness, egodystonic).[17]\\r\\nIn 1952, the APA listed homosexuality in the DSM as a sociopathic personality disturbance. Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals, a large-scale 1962 study of homosexuality by Irving Bieber and other authors, was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parentÿchild relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession.[18][full citation needed] In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference.[19][full citation needed] Her study stunned the medical community and made her a heroine to many gay men and lesbians,[20][full citation needed] but homosexuality remained in the DSM until May 1974.[21]\\r\\nIn the 1960s, there were many challenges to the concept of mental illness itself. These challenges came from psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz, who argued that mental illness was a myth used to disguise moral conflicts; from sociologists such as Erving Goffman, who said mental illness was merely another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; from behavioural psychologists who challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; and from gay rights activists who criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. A study published in Science by Rosenhan received much publicity and was viewed as an attack on the efficacy of psychiatric diagnosis.[22]\\r\\nAlthough the APA was closely involved in the next significant revision of the mental disorder section of the ICD (version 8 in 1968), it decided to go ahead with a revision of the DSM. It was published in 1968, listed 182 disorders, and was 134 pages long. It was quite similar to the DSM-I. The term \\"reaction\\" was dropped, but the term \\"neurosis\\" was retained. Both the DSM-I and the DSM-II reflected the predominant psychodynamic psychiatry,[23] although they also included biological perspectives and concepts from Kraepelin's system of classification. Symptoms were not specified in detail for specific disorders. Many were seen as reflections of broad underlying conflicts or maladaptive reactions to life problems, rooted in a distinction between neurosis and psychosis (roughly, anxiety/depression broadly in touch with reality, or hallucinations/delusions appearing disconnected from reality). Sociological and biological knowledge was incorporated, in a model that did not emphasize a clear boundary between normality and abnormality.[24] The idea that personality disorders did not involve emotional distress was discarded.[17]\\r\\nAn influential 1974 paper by Robert Spitzer and Joseph L. Fleiss demonstrated that the second edition of the DSM (DSM-II) was an unreliable diagnostic tool.[25] They found that different practitioners using the DSM-II were rarely in agreement when diagnosing patients with similar problems. In reviewing previous studies of 18 major diagnostic categories, Fleiss and Spitzer concluded that \\"there are no diagnostic categories for which reliability is uniformly high. Reliability appears to be only satisfactory for three categories: mental deficiency, organic brain syndrome (but not its subtypes), and alcoholism. The level of reliability is no better than fair for psychosis and schizophrenia and is poor for the remaining categories\\".[26]\\r\\nAs described by Ronald Bayer, a psychiatrist and gay rights activist, specific protests by gay rights activists against the APA began in 1970, when the organization held its convention in San Francisco. The activists disrupted the conference by interrupting speakers and shouting down and ridiculing psychiatrists who viewed homosexuality as a mental disorder. In 1971, gay rights activist Frank Kameny worked with the Gay Liberation Front collective to demonstrate against the APA's convention. At the 1971 conference, Kameny grabbed the microphone and yelled: \\"Psychiatry is the enemy incarnate. Psychiatry has waged a relentless war of extermination against us. You may take this as a declaration of war against you.\\"[27]\\r\\nThis activism occurred in the context of a broader anti-psychiatry movement that had come to the fore in the 1960s and was challenging the legitimacy of psychiatric diagnosis. Anti-psychiatry activists protested at the same APA conventions, with some shared slogans and intellectual foundations.[28][29]\\r\\nPresented with data from researchers such as Alfred Kinsey and Evelyn Hooker, the sixth printing of the DSM-II, in 1974, no longer listed homosexuality as a category of disorder. After a vote by the APA trustees in 1973, and confirmed by the wider APA membership in 1974, the diagnosis was replaced with the category of \\"sexual orientation disturbance\\".[30]\\r\\nIn 1974, the decision to create a new revision of the DSM was made, and Robert Spitzer was selected as chairman of the task force. The initial impetus was to make the DSM nomenclature consistent with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), published by the World Health Organization. The revision took on a far wider mandate under the influence and control of Spitzer and his chosen committee members.[31] One goal was to improve the uniformity and validity of psychiatric diagnosis in the wake of a number of critiques, including the famous Rosenhan experiment. There was also a need to standardize diagnostic practices within the US and with other countries after research showed that psychiatric diagnoses differed markedly between Europe and the US.[32] The establishment of these criteria was an attempt to facilitate the pharmaceutical regulatory process.\\r\\nThe criteria adopted for many of the mental disorders were taken from the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) and Feighner Criteria, which had just been developed by a group of research-orientated psychiatrists based primarily at Washington University in St. Louis and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Other criteria, and potential new categories of disorder, were established by consensus during meetings of the committee, as chaired by Spitzer. A key aim was to base categorization on colloquial English descriptive language (which would be easier to use by federal administrative offices), rather than assumptions of cause, although its categorical approach assumed each particular pattern of symptoms in a category reflected a particular underlying pathology (an approach described as \\"neo-Kraepelinian\\"). The psychodynamic or physiologic view was abandoned, in favor of a regulatory or legislative model. A new \\"multiaxial\\" system attempted to yield a picture more amenable to a statistical population census, rather than just a simple diagnosis. Spitzer argued that \\"mental disorders are a subset of medical disorders\\" but the task force decided on the DSM statement: \\"Each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome.\\"[23] The personality disorders were placed on axis II along with mental retardation.[17]\\r\\nThe first draft of the DSM-III was prepared within a year. Many new categories of disorder were introduced, while some were deleted or changed. A number of the unpublished documents discussing and justifying the changes have recently come to light.[33] Field trials sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) were conducted between 1977 and 1979 to test the reliability of the new diagnoses. A controversy emerged regarding deletion of the concept of neurosis, a mainstream of psychoanalytic theory and therapy but seen as vague and unscientific by the DSM task force. Faced with enormous political opposition, the DSM-III was in serious danger of not being approved by the APA Board of Trustees unless \\"neurosis\\" was included in some capacity; a political compromise reinserted the term in parentheses after the word \\"disorder\\" in some cases. Additionally, the diagnosis of ego-dystonic homosexuality replaced the DSM-II category of \\"sexual orientation disturbance\\".\\r\\nFinally published in 1980, the DSM-III was 494 pages and listed 265 diagnostic categories. It rapidly came into widespread international use and has been termed a revolution or transformation in psychiatry.[23][24] However, Robert Spitzer later criticized his own work on it in an interview with Adam Curtis, saying it led to the medicalization of 20-30 percent of the population who may not have had any serious mental problems.\\r\\nWhen DSM-III was published, the developers made extensive claims about the reliability of the radically new diagnostic system they had devised, which relied on data from special field trials. However, according to a 1994 article by Stuart A. Kirk:\\r\\nTwenty years after the reliability problem became the central focus of DSM-III, there is still not a single multi-site study showing that DSM (any version) is routinely used with high reliably by regular mental health clinicians. Nor is there any credible evidence that any version of the manual has greatly increased its reliability beyond the previous version. There are important methodological problems that limit the generalisability of most reliability studies. Each reliability study is constrained by the training and supervision of the interviewers, their motivation and commitment to diagnostic accuracy, their prior skill, the homogeneity of the clinical setting in regard to patient mix and base rates, and the methodological rigor achieved by the investigator[22]\\r\\nIn 1987, the DSM-III-R was published as a revision of the DSM-III, under the direction of Spitzer. Categories were renamed and reorganized, and significant changes in criteria were made. Six categories were deleted while others were added. Controversial diagnoses, such as pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder and masochistic personality disorder, were considered and discarded. \\"Ego-dystonic homosexuality\\" was also removed and was largely subsumed under \\"sexual disorder not otherwise specified\\", which can include \\"persistent and marked distress about one's sexual orientation.\\"[23][34] Altogether, the DSM-III-R contained 292 diagnoses and was 567 pages long. Further efforts were made for the diagnoses to be purely descriptive, although the introductory text stated that for at least some disorders, \\"particularly the Personality Disorders, the criteria require much more inference on the part of the observer\\" (p. xxiii).[17]\\r\\nIn 1994, DSM-IV was published, listing 297 disorders in 886 pages. The task force was chaired by Allen Frances. A steering committee of 27 people was introduced, including four psychologists. The steering committee created 13 work groups of five to 16 members. Each work group had about 20 advisers. The work groups conducted a three-step process: first, each group conducted an extensive literature review of their diagnoses; then, they requested data from researchers, conducting analyses to determine which criteria required change, with instructions to be conservative; finally, they conducted multicenter field trials relating diagnoses to clinical practice.[35][36] A major change from previous versions was the inclusion of a clinical significance criterion to almost half of all the categories, which required that symptoms cause \\"clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\\". Some personality disorder diagnoses were deleted or moved to the appendix.[17]\\r\\nA \\"text revision\\" of the DSM-IV, known as the DSM-IV-TR, was published in 2000. The diagnostic categories and the vast majority of the specific criteria for diagnosis were unchanged.[37] The text sections giving extra information on each diagnosis were updated, as were some of the diagnostic codes to maintain consistency with the ICD. The DSM-IV-TR was organized into a five-part axial system. The first axis incorporated clinical disorders. The second axis covered personality disorders and intellectual disabilities. The remaining axes covered medical, psychosocial, environmental, and childhood factors functionally necessary to provide diagnostic criteria for health care assessments.\\r\\nThe DSM-IV-TR characterizes a mental disorder as \\"a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual [which] is associated with present distress or disability or with a significant increased risk of suffering.\\" It also notes that \\"no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of 'mental disorder' different situations call for different definitions\\". It states that \\"there is no assumption that each category of mental disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries dividing it from other mental disorders or from no mental disorder\\" (APA, 1994 and 2000).\\r\\nThe DSM-IV is a categorical classification system. The categories are prototypes, and a patient with a close approximation to the prototype is said to have that disorder. DSM-IV states, \\"there is no assumption each category of mental disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries\\" but isolated, low-grade and non-criterion (unlisted for a given disorder) symptoms are not given importance.[38] Qualifiers are sometimes used, for example mild, moderate or severe forms of a disorder. For nearly half the disorders, symptoms must be sufficient to cause \\"clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\\", although DSM-IV-TR removed the distress criterion from tic disorders and several of the paraphilias due to their egosyntonic nature. Each category of disorder has a numeric code taken from the ICD coding system, used for health service (including insurance) administrative purposes.\\r\\nWith the advent of the DSM-5 in 2013, the APA eliminated the longstanding multiaxial system for mental disorders.[39]\\r\\nPreviously, the DSM-IV organized each psychiatric diagnosis into five dimensions (axes) relating to different aspects of disorder or disability:\\r\\nMental/Psychiatric/Behavioral/Learning conditions include, but are not limited to: depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and schizophrenia.\\r\\nPersonality Disorders include, but are not limited to: paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder; and organic intellectual disabilities.\\r\\nCommon medical/physical conditions or diseases that may result in and/or exacerbate some of the aforementioned mental/psychiatric conditions OR that may be aggravated by the aforementioned mental/psychiatric conditions include, but are not limited to: brain injuries, terminal diseases, pregnancy, cancer, epilepsy, idiopathic physiological conditions and virtually any other conditions, ailments and/or injuries which may affect the patient's mental health.. Many Biopsychosocial Assessments incorporate multiple factors that adversely affect the patient's, client's and/or subject's overall well-being and homeostasis.\\r\\nTypical psychosocial influences that are usually listed as having negative impact on life, mentality and health include, but are not limited to: Environmental factors of dysfunction such as those experienced within home, school and work; Social factors such as issues with drug use (not diagnosed), enabling friends and conflicts with coworkers; Family complications such as divorce, social service involvement and court ordered placements; Various stressors such as recent accident, natural disaster and other traumatic occurrences (i.e. assault, death, abuse); Financial problems such as bankruptcy, job loss and debts; and service needs such as lack of medical insurance, inability to find adequate treatment and inaccessibility to necessary state and federal programs.\\r\\nThe DSM-IV does not specifically cite its sources, but there are four volumes of \\"sourcebooks\\" intended to be APA's documentation of the guideline development process and supporting evidence, including literature reviews, data analyses and field trials.[40][41][42][43] The Sourcebooks have been said to provide important insights into the character and quality of the decisions that led to the production of DSM-IV, and hence the scientific credibility of contemporary psychiatric classification.[44][45]\\r\\nThe fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the DSM-5, was approved by the Board of Trustees of the APA on December 1, 2012.[46] Published on May 18, 2013,[47] the DSM-5 contains extensively revised diagnoses and, in some cases, broadens diagnostic definitions while narrowing definitions in other cases.[48] The DSM-5 is the first major edition of the manual in twenty years.[49]\\r\\nA significant change in the fifth edition is the deletion of the subtypes of schizophrenia (paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated and residual).[50]\\r\\nThe deletion of the subsets of autistic spectrum disorder (namely, Asperger's syndrome, classic autism, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) was also implemented, with specifiers with regard to intensity (mild, moderate and severe). Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, with three levels: 1 (requiring support), 2 (requiring substantial support) and 3 (requiring very substantial support).\\r\\nDuring the revision process, the APA website periodically listed several sections of the DSM-5 for review and discussion.[51]\\r\\nBeginning with the fifth edition, it is intended that diagnostic guidelines revisions will be added more frequently to keep up with research in the field.[52] It is notable that the DSM-5 is identified with Arabic rather than Roman numerals. Beginning with DSM-5, the American Psychiatric Association will use decimals to identify incremental updates (e.g., DSM-5.1, DSM-5.2) and whole numbers for new editions (e.g., DSM-5, DSM-6),[53] similar to the scheme used for software versioning.\\r\\nThe revisions of the DSM from the 3rd Edition forward have been mainly concerned with diagnostic reliabilitythe degree to which different diagnosticians agree on a diagnosis. It was argued{Henrik Walter} that a science of psychiatry can only advance if diagnosis is reliable. If clinicians and researchers frequently disagree about the diagnosis of a patient, then research into the causes and effective treatments of those disorders cannot advance. Hence, diagnostic reliability was a major concern of DSM-III.[citation needed] When the diagnostic reliability problem was thought to be solved, subsequent editions of the DSM were concerned mainly with \\"tweaking\\" the diagnostic criteria.[citation needed] Unfortunately, neither the issue of reliability or validity was settled.[54][better?source?needed] However, most psychiatric education post DSM-III focused on issues of treatmentespecially drug treatmentand less on diagnostic concerns.[citation needed] In fact, Thomas R. Insel, M.D., Director of the NIMH, stated in 2013 that the agency would no longer fund research projects that rely exclusively on DSM criteria due to its lack of validity.[55] Field trials of DSM-5 brought the debate of reliability back into the limelight as some disorders showed poor reliability. For example, major depressive disorder, a common mental illness, had a poor reliability kappa statistic of 0.28, indicating that clinicians frequently disagreed on this diagnosis in the same patients. The most reliable diagnosis was major neurocognitive disorder with a kappa of 0.78.[56]\\r\\nBy design, the DSM is primarily concerned with the signs and symptoms of mental disorders, rather than the underlying causes. It claims to collect them together based on statistical or clinical patterns. As such, it has been compared to a naturalist's field guide to birds, with similar advantages and disadvantages.[57] The lack of a causative or explanatory basis, however, is not specific to the DSM, but rather reflects a general lack of pathophysiological understanding of psychiatric disorders. As DSM-III chief architect Robert Spitzer and DSM-IV editor Michael First outlined in 2005, \\"little progress has been made toward understanding the pathophysiological processes and cause of mental disorders. If anything, the research has shown the situation is even more complex than initially imagined, and we believe not enough is known to structure the classification of psychiatric disorders according to etiology.\\"[58]\\r\\nThe DSM's focus on superficial symptoms is claimed to be largely a result of necessity (assuming such a manual is nevertheless produced), since there is no agreement on a more explanatory classification system.[citation needed] Reviewers note, however, that this approach is undermining research, including in genetics, because it results in the grouping of individuals who have very little in common except superficial criteria as per DSM or ICD diagnosis.[5]\\r\\nDespite the lack of consensus on underlying causation, advocates for specific psychopathological paradigms have nonetheless faulted the current diagnostic scheme for not incorporating evidence-based models or findings from other areas of science. A recent example is evolutionary psychologists' criticism that the DSM does not differentiate between genuine cognitive malfunctions and those induced by psychological adaptations, a key distinction within evolutionary psychology but one that is widely challenged within general psychology.[59][60][61] Another example is the strong operationalist viewpoint, which contends that reliance on operational definitions, as purported by the DSM, necessitates that intuitive concepts like depression be replaced by specific measurable concepts before they are scientifically meaningful. One critic states of psychologists that \\"Instead of replacing 'metaphysical' terms such as 'desire' and 'purpose', they used it to legitimize them by giving them operational definitionsthe initial, quite radical operationalist ideas eventually came to serve as little more than a 'reassurance fetish' (Koch 1992) for mainstream methodological practice.\\"[62]\\r\\nA 2013 review published in the European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience states \\"that psychiatry targets the phenomena of consciousness, which, unlike somatic symptoms and signs, cannot be grasped on the analogy with material thing-like objects.\\" As an example of the problem of the superficial characterization of psychiatric signs and symptoms, the authors gave the example of a patient saying they \\"feel depressed, sad, or down\\", showing that such a statement could indicate various underlying experiences: \\"not only depressed mood but also, for instance, irritation, anger, loss of meaning, varieties of fatigue, ambivalence, ruminations of different kinds, hyper-reflectivity, thought pressure, psychological anxiety, varieties of depersonalization, and even voices with negative content, and so forth.\\" The structured interview comes with \\"danger of over confidence in the face value of the answers, as if a simple 'yes' or 'no' truly confirmed or denied the diagnostic criterion at issue.\\" The authors gave an example: A patient who was being administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV Axis I Disorders denied thought insertion, but during a \\"conversational, phenomenological interview\\", a semi-structured interview tailored to the patient, the same patient admitted to experiencing thought insertion, along with a delusional elaboration. The authors suggested 2 reasons for this discrepancy: either the patient did not \\"recognize his own experience in the rather blunt, implicitly either/or formulation of the structured-interview question\\", or the experience did not \\"fully articulate itself\\" until the patient started talking about his experiences.[63]\\r\\nDespite caveats in the introduction to the DSM, it has long been argued that its system of classification makes unjustified categorical distinctions between disorders and uses arbitrary cut-offs between normal and abnormal. A 2009 psychiatric review noted that attempts to demonstrate natural boundaries between related DSM syndromes, or between a common DSM syndrome and normality, have failed.[5] Some argue that rather than a categorical approach, a fully dimensional, spectrum or complaint-oriented approach would better reflect the evidence.[64][65][66][67]\\r\\nIn addition, it is argued that the current approach based on exceeding a threshold of symptoms does not adequately take into account the context in which a person is living, and to what extent there is internal disorder of an individual versus a psychological response to adverse situations.[68][69] The DSM does include a step (\\"Axis IV\\") for outlining \\"Psychosocial and environmental factors contributing to the disorder\\" once someone is diagnosed with that particular disorder.\\r\\nBecause an individual's degree of impairment is often not correlated with symptom counts and can stem from various individual and social factors, the DSM's standard of distress or disability can often produce false positives.[70] On the other hand, individuals who do not meet symptom counts may nevertheless experience comparable distress or disability in their life.\\r\\nSome psychiatrists argue that current diagnostic standards rely on an exaggerated interpretation of neurophysiological findings and so understate the scientific importance of social-psychological variables.[71] Advocating a more culturally sensitive approach to psychology, critics such as Carl Bell and Marcello Maviglia contend that the cultural and ethnic diversity of individuals is often discounted by researchers and service providers.[72] In addition, current diagnostic guidelines have been criticized as having a fundamentally Euro-American outlook. Although these guidelines have been widely implemented, opponents argue that even when a diagnostic criterion set is accepted across different cultures, it does not necessarily indicate that the underlying constructs have any validity within those cultures; even reliable application can only demonstrate consistency, not legitimacy.[71] Cross-cultural psychiatrist Arthur Kleinman contends that the Western bias is ironically illustrated in the introduction of cultural factors to the DSM-IV: the fact that disorders or concepts from non-Western or non-mainstream cultures are described as \\"culture-bound\\", whereas standard psychiatric diagnoses are given no cultural qualification whatsoever, is to Kleinman revelatory of an underlying assumption that Western cultural phenomena are universal.[73] Kleinman's negative view toward the culture-bound syndrome is largely shared by other cross-cultural critics, common responses included both disappointment over the large number of documented non-Western mental disorders still left out, and frustration that even those included were often misinterpreted or misrepresented.[74][page?needed] Many mainstream psychiatrists have also been dissatisfied with these new culture-bound diagnoses, although not for the same reasons. Robert Spitzer, a lead architect of the DSM-III, has held the opinion that the addition of cultural formulations was an attempt to placate cultural critics, and that they lack any scientific motivation or support. Spitzer also posits that the new culture-bound diagnoses are rarely used in practice, maintaining that the standard diagnoses apply regardless of the culture involved. In general, the mainstream psychiatric opinion remains that if a diagnostic category is valid, cross-cultural factors are either irrelevant or are only significant to specific symptom presentations.[71] One of the results was the development of the Azibo Nosology by Daudi Ajani Ya Azibo as an alternative to the DSM to treat African and African American patients.[75][76][77]\\r\\nIt has also been alleged that the way the categories of the DSM are structured, as well as the substantial expansion of the number of categories, are representative of an increasing medicalization of human nature, which may be attributed to disease mongering by psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies, the power and influence of the latter having grown dramatically in recent decades.[78] Of the authors who selected and defined the DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, roughly half have had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry at one time, raising the prospect of a direct conflict of interest.[79] The same article concludes that the connections between panel members and the drug companies were particularly strong in those diagnoses where drugs are the first line of treatment, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, where 100% of the panel members had financial ties with the pharmaceutical industry.[79] In 2005, then APA President Steven Sharfstein released a statement in which he conceded that psychiatrists had \\"allowed the biopsychosocial model to become the bio-bio-bio model\\".[80]\\r\\nHowever, although the number of identified diagnoses has increased by more than 300% (from 106 in DSM-I to 365 in DSM-IV-TR), psychiatrists such as Zimmerman and Spitzer argue it almost entirely represents greater specification of the forms of pathology, thereby allowing better grouping of more similar patients.[5] However, William Glasser refers to the DSM as \\"phony diagnostic categories\\", arguing that \\"it was developed to help psychiatrists ÿ to help them make money\\".[81] In addition, the publishing of the DSM, with tightly guarded copyrights, has in itself earned over $100?million for the APA.[9]\\r\\nA client is a person who accesses psychiatric services and may have been given a diagnosis from the DSM, while a survivor self-identifies as a person who has endured a psychiatric intervention and the mental health system (which may have involved involuntary commitment and involuntary treatment).[citation needed] A term adopted by many users of psychiatric services is \\"consumer.\\" This term was chosen to eliminate the \\"patient\\" label and restore the person to an active role as a user or consumer of services.[82] Some individuals[who?] are relieved to find that they have a recognized condition that they can apply a name to and this has led to many people self-diagnosing.[citation needed] Others, however, question the accuracy of the diagnosis, or feel they have been given a \\"label\\" that invites social stigma and discrimination (the terms \\"mentalism\\" and \\"sanism\\" have been used to describe such discriminatory treatment).[83]\\r\\nDiagnoses can become internalized and affect an individual's self-identity, and some psychotherapists have found that the healing process can be inhibited and symptoms can worsen as a result.[84] Some members of the psychiatric survivors movement (more broadly the consumer/survivor/ex-patient movement)[who?] actively campaign against their diagnoses, or the assumed implications, and/or against the DSM system in general. Additionally, it has been noted that the DSM often uses definitions and terminology that are inconsistent with a recovery model, and such content can erroneously imply excess psychopathology (e.g. multiple \\"comorbid\\" diagnoses) or chronicity.[85]\\r\\nPsychiatrist Allen Frances has been critical of proposed revisions to the DSM-5. In a 2012 New York Times editorial, Frances warned that if this DSM version is issued unamended by the APA, \\"it will medicalize normality and result in a glut of unnecessary and harmful drug prescription.\\"[86] In a December 2, 2012 blog post in Psychology Today, Frances provides his \\"list of DSM 5's ten most potentially harmful changes\\":[87][unreliable medical source?]\\r\\nFrances and others have published debates on what they see as the six most essential questions in psychiatric diagnosis:[88]\\r\\nIn 2011, psychologist Brent Robbins co-authored a national letter for the Society for Humanistic Psychology that has brought thousands into the public debate about the DSM. Over 15,000 individuals and mental health professionals have signed a petition in support of the letter.[89] Thirteen other American Psychological Association divisions have endorsed the petition.[90] Robbins has noted that under the new guidelines, certain responses to grief could be labeled as pathological disorders, instead of being recognized as being normal human experiences.[91]","input":"How many editions of the dsm are there?"},{"output":"4th Dynasty","context":"Ancient Egyptian technology describes devices and technologies invented or used in Ancient Egypt. The Egyptians invented and used many simple machines, such as the ramp and the lever, to aid construction processes. They used rope trusses to stiffen the beam of ships. Egyptian paper, made from papyrus, and pottery were mass-produced and exported throughout the Mediterranean basin. The wheel was used for a number of purposes, but chariots only came into use after the Second Intermediate period. The Egyptians also played an important role in developing Mediterranean maritime technology including ships and lighthouses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant advances in ancient Egypt during the dynastic period include astronomy, mathematics, and medicine.

Egypt also was a center of alchemy research for much of the western world.\\r\\nThe word paper comes from the Greek term for the ancient Egyptian writing material called papyrus, which was formed from beaten strips of papyrus plants. Papyrus was produced as early as 3000?BC in Egypt, and sold to ancient Greece and Rome. The establishment of the Library of Alexandria limited the supply of papyrus for others. As a result, according to the Roman historian Pliny (Natural History records, xiii.21), parchment was invented under the patronage of Eumenes II of Pergamon to build his rival library at Pergamon. This however is a myth; parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.\\r\\nEgyptian hieroglyphs, a phonetic writing system, served as the basis for the Phoenician alphabet from which later alphabets were derived. With this ability, writing and record keeping, the Egyptians developed one of the if not the first decimal system.[1][2][3]\\r\\nThe city of Alexandria retained preeminence for its records and scrolls with its library. That ancient library was damaged by fire when it fell under Roman rule,[4] and was destroyed completely by 642?CE.[5][6] With it, a huge amount of antique literature, history, and knowledge was lost.\\r\\nSome of the older tools used in the construction of Egyptian housing included reeds and clay. According to Lucas and Harris, reeds were plastered with clay in order to keep out of heat and cold more effectually. [7] Other tools that were used were \\"limestone, chiseled stones, wooden mallets, and stone hammers\\". [8] With these tools, ancient Egyptians were able to create more than just housing, but also sculptures of their gods, goddesses, pyramids, etc.\\r\\nMany temples from Ancient Egypt are not standing today. Some are in ruin from wear and tear, while others have been lost entirely. The Egyptian structures are among the largest constructions ever conceived and built by humans. They constitute one of the most potent and enduring symbols of Ancient Egyptian civilization. Temples and tombs built by a pharaoh famous for her projects, Hatshepsut, were massive and included many colossal statues of her. Pharaoh Tutankamun's rock-cut tomb in the Valley of the Kings was full of jewellery and antiques. In some late myths, Ptah was identified as the primordial mound and had called creation into being, he was considered the deity of craftsmen, and in particular, of stone-based crafts. Imhotep, who was included in the Egyptian pantheon, was the first documented engineer.[9]\\r\\nIn Hellenistic Egypt, lighthouse technology was developed, the most famous example being the Lighthouse of Alexandria. Alexandria was a port for the ships that traded the goods manufactured in Egypt or imported into Egypt. A giant cantilevered hoist lifted cargo to and from ships. The lighthouse itself was designed by Sostratus of Cnidus and built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247?BC) on the island of Pharos in Alexandria, Egypt, which has since become a peninsula. This lighthouse was renowned in its time and knowledge of it was never lost. A 2006 drawing of it created from the study of many references, is shown at the right.\\r\\nThe Nile valley has been the site of one of the most influential civilizations in the world with its architectural monuments, which include the pyramids of Giza and the Great Sphinxamong the largest and most famous buildings in the world.\\r\\nThe most famous pyramids are the Egyptian pyramidshuge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the largest constructions by humans. Pyramids functioned as tombs for pharaohs. In Ancient Egypt, a pyramid was referred to as mer, literally \\"place of ascendance.\\" The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest in Egypt and one of the largest in the world. The base is over 13 acres (53,000?m2) in area. It is one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and the only one of the seven to survive into modern times. The Ancient Egyptians capped the peaks of their pyramids with gold and covered their faces with polished white limestone, although many of the stones used for the finishing purpose have fallen or been removed for use on other structures over the millennia.\\r\\nThe Red Pyramid of Egypt (c.26th century BC), named for the light crimson hue of its exposed granite surfaces, is the third largest of Egyptian pyramids. Menkaure's Pyramid, likely dating to the same era, was constructed of limestone and granite blocks. The Great Pyramid of Giza (c. 2580 BC) contains a huge granite sarcophagus fashioned of \\"Red Aswan Granite.\\" The mostly ruined Black Pyramid dating from the reign of Amenemhat III once had a polished granite pyramidion or capstone, now on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (see Dahshur). Other uses in Ancient Egypt,[10] include columns, door lintels, sills, jambs, and wall and floor veneer.\\r\\nThe ancient Egyptians had some of the first monumental stone buildings (such as in Sakkara). How the Egyptians worked the solid granite is still a matter of debate. Archaeologist Patrick Hunt[11] has postulated that the Egyptians used emery shown to have higher hardness on the Mohs scale. Regarding construction, of the various methods possibly used by builders, the lever moved and uplifted obelisks weighing more than 100 tons.\\r\\nObelisks were a prominent part of the architecture of the ancient Egyptians, who placed them in pairs at the entrances of various monuments and important buildings, such as temples. In 1902, Encyclop?dia Britannica wrote, \\"The earliest temple obelisk still in position is that of Senusret I of the XIIth Dynasty at Heliopolis (68?feet high)\\". The word \\"obelisk\\" is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because Herodotus, the great traveler, was the first writer to describe the objects. Twenty-nine ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the unfinished obelisk being built by Hatshepsut to celebrate her sixteenth year as pharaoh. It broke while being carved out of the quarry and was abandoned when another one was begun to replace it. The broken one was found at Aswan and provides the only insight into the methods of how they were hewn. The obelisk symbolized the sky deity Ra and during the brief religious reformation of Akhenaten, was said to be a petrified ray of the Aten, the sun disk. It is hypothesized by New York University Egyptologist Patricia Blackwell Gary and Astronomy senior editor Richard Talcott that the shapes of the ancient Egyptian pyramid and Obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the sun (the sun-god Ra being the Egyptians' greatest deity).[12] It was also thought that the deity existed within the structure. The Egyptians also used pillars extensively.\\r\\nIt is unknown whether the Ancient Egyptians had kites, but a team led by Maureen Clemmons and Mory Gharib raised a 5,900-pound, 15-foot (4.6?m) obelisk into vertical position with a kite, a system of pulleys, and a support frame.[13] Maureen Clemmons developed the idea that the ancient Egyptians used kites for work.[13] Ramps have been reported as being widely used in Ancient Egypt. A ramp is an inclined plane, or a plane surface set at an angle (other than a right angle) against a horizontal surface. The inclined plane permits one to overcome a large resistance by applying a relatively small force through a longer distance than the load is to be raised. In civil engineering the slope (ratio of rise/run) is often referred to as a grade or gradient. An inclined plane is one of the commonly-recognized simple machines. Maureen Clemmons subsequently lead a team of researchers demonstrating a kite made of natural material and reinforced with shellac (which according to their research pulled with 97% the efficiency of nylon), in a 9?mph wind, would easily pull an average 2-ton pyramid stone up the 1st two courses of a pyramid (in collaboration with Cal Poly, Pomona, on a 53-stone pyramid built in Rosamond, CA).\\r\\nThe Ancient Egyptians had knowledge to some extent of sail construction. This is governed by the science of aerodynamics.[14] The earliest Egyptian sails were simply placed to catch the wind and push a vessel.[15] Later Egyptian sails dating to 2400 BCE were built with the recognition that ships could sail against the wind using the lift of the sails.[15][16] Queen Hatshepsut oversaw the preparations and funding of an expedition of five ships, each measuring seventy feet long, and with several sails.[dubious ÿ discuss][citation needed]Various others exist, also.\\r\\nEgyptian ship with a loose-footed sail, similar to a longship.

Note that the sail is stretched between yards.\\r\\nLoading Egyptian vessels with the produce of Punt. Shows folded sails, lowered upper yard, yard construction, and heavy deck cargo.\\r\\nAncient Egyptians had experience with building a variety of ships.[17][18][19] Some of them survive to this day as Khufu Solar ship.[20] The ships were found in many areas of Egypt as the Abydos boats[21][22][23] and remnants of other ships were found near the pyramids.[22][24][25]\\r\\nSneferu's ancient cedar wood ship Praise of the Two Lands is the first reference recorded to a ship being referred to by name.[26]\\r\\nAlthough quarter rudders were the norm in Nile navigation, the Egyptians were the first to use also stern-mounted rudders (not of the modern type but center mounted steering oars).\\r\\nIrrigation as the artificial application of water to the soil was used to some extent in Ancient Egypt, a hydraulic civilization (which entails hydraulic engineering).[27] In crop production it is mainly used to replace missing rainfall in periods of drought, as opposed to reliance on direct rainfall (referred to as dryland farming or as rainfed farming). Before technology advanced, the people of Egypt relied on the natural flow of the Nile River to tend to the crops. Although the Nile provided sufficient watering survival domesticated animals, crops, and the people of Egypt, there were times where the Nile would flood the area wreaking havoc amongst the land. [28] There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhet III in the twelfth dynasty (about 1800 BCE) using the natural lake of the Fay?m as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons, as the lake swelled annually with the flooding of the Nile.[29] Construction of drainage canals reduced the problems of major flooding from entering homes and areas of crops; but because it was a hydraulic civilization, much of the water management was controlled in a systematic way. [30]\\r\\nEgyptian knowledge of glassmaking was advanced.[31] The earliest known glass beads from Egypt were made during the New Kingdom around 1500?BC and were produced in a variety of colors. They were made by winding molten glass around a metal bar and were highly prized as a trading commodity, especially blue beads, which were believed to have magical powers. The Egyptians made small jars and bottles using the core-formed method. Glass threads were wound around a bag of sand tied to a rod. The glass was continually reheated to fuse the threads together. The glass-covered sand bag was kept in motion until the required shape and thickness was achieved. The rod was allowed to cool, then finally the bag was punctured and the sand poured out and reused . The Egyptians also created the first colored glass rods which they used to create colorful beads and decorations. They also worked with cast glass, which was produced by pouring molten glass into a mold, much like iron and the more modern crucible steel.[32]\\r\\nThe Egyptians were a practical people and this is reflected in their astronomy[33] in contrast to Babylonia where the first astronomical texts were written in astrological terms.[34] Even before Upper and Lower Egypt were unified in 3000 BCE, observations of the night sky had influenced the development of a religion in which many of its principal deities were heavenly bodies. In Lower Egypt, priests built circular mud-brick walls with which to make a false horizon where they could mark the position of the sun as it rose at dawn, and then with a plumb-bob note the northern or southern turning points (solstices). This allowed them to discover that the sun disc, personified as Ra, took 365 days to travel from his birthplace at the winter solstice and back to it. Meanwhile, in Upper Egypt a lunar calendar was being developed based on the behavior of the moon and the reappearance of Sirius in its heliacal rising after its annual absence of about 70 days.[35]\\r\\nAfter unification, problems with trying to work with two calendars (both depending upon constant observation) led to a merged, simplified civil calendar with twelve 30-day months, three seasons of four months each, plus an extra five days, giving a 365-year day but with no way of accounting for the extra quarter day each year. Day and night were split into 24 units, each personified by a deity. A sundial found on Seti I's cenotaph with instructions for its use shows us that the daylight hours were at one time split into 10 units, with 12 hours for the night and an hour for the morning and evening twilights.[36] However, by Seti I's time day and night were normally divided into 12 hours each, the length of which would vary according to the time of year.\\r\\nKey to much of this was the motion of the sun god Ra and his annual movement along the horizon at sunrise. Out of Egyptian myths such as those around Ra and the sky goddess Nut came the development of the Egyptian calendar, time keeping, and even concepts of royalty. An astronomical ceiling in the burial chamber of Ramesses VI shows the sun being born from Nut in the morning, traveling along her body during the day and being swallowed at night.\\r\\nDuring the Fifth Dynasty six kings built sun temples in honour of Ra. The temple complexes built by Niuserre at Abu Gurab and Userkaf at Abusir have been excavated and have astronomical alignments, and the roofs of some of the buildings could have been used by observers to view the stars, calculate the hours at night and predict the sunrise for religious festivals.[citation needed]\\r\\nClaims have been made that precession of the equinoxes was known in Ancient Egypt prior to the time of Hipparchus.[37] This has been disputed however on the grounds that pre-Hipparchus texts do not mention precession and that \\"it is only by cunning interpretation of ancient myths and images, which are ostensibly about something else, that precession can be discerned in them, aided by some pretty esoteric numerological speculation involving the 72 years that mark one degree of shift in the zodiacal system and any number of permutations by multiplication, division, and addition.\\" [38]\\r\\nNote however that the Egyptian observation of a slowly changing stellar alignment over a multi-year period does not necessarily mean that they understood or even cared what was going on. For instance, from the Middle Kingdom onwards they used a table with entries for each month to tell the time of night from the passing of constellations. These went in error after a few centuries because of their calendar and precession, but were copied (with scribal errors) long after they lost their practical usefulness or the possibility of understanding and use of them in the current years, rather than the years in which they were originally used.\\r\\nThe Edwin Smith Papyrus is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document which attempts to describe and analyze the brain: given this, it might be seen as the very beginnings of neuroscience. However, medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology was largely ineffective.[39] According to a paper published by Michael D. Parkins, 72% of 260 medical prescriptions in the Hearst Papyrus had no curative elements.[40] According to Michael D. Parkins, sewage pharmacology first began in ancient Egypt and was continued through the Middle Ages,[39] and while the use of animal dung can have curative properties,[41] it is not without its risk. Practices such as applying cow dung to wounds, ear piercing, tattooing, and chronic ear infections were important factors in developing tetanus.[42] Frank J. Snoek wrote that Egyptian medicine used fly specks, lizard blood, swine teeth, and other such remedies which he believes could have been harmful.[43]\\r\\nMummification of the dead was not always practiced in Egypt. Once the practice began, an individual was placed at a final resting place through a set of rituals and protocol. The Egyptian funeral was a complex ceremony including various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in honor of the deceased. The poor, who could not afford expensive tombs, were buried in shallow graves in the sand, and because of the arid environment they were often naturally mummified.\\r\\nEvidence indicates that Egyptians made use of potter's wheels in the manufacturing of pottery from as early as the 4th Dynasty.[44] Chariots, however, are only believed to have been introduced by the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate period;[45] during the New Kingdom era, chariotry became central to Egypt's military.\\r\\nThe Egyptians developed a variety of furniture. There in the lands of ancient Egypt is the first evidence for stools, beds, and tables (such as from the tombs similar to Tutenkhamen's). Recovered Ancient Egyptian furniture includes a third millennium BC bed discovered in the Tarkhan Tomb, a c.2550?BC. gilded set from the tomb of Queen Hetepheres I, and a c. 1550?BC. stool from Thebes.\\r\\nSome have suggested that the Egyptians had some form of understanding electric phenomena from observing lightning and interacting with electric fish (such as Malapterurus electricus) or other animals (such as electric eels).[46] The comment about lightning appears to come from a misunderstanding of a text referring to \\"high poles covered with copper plates\\" to argue this[47] but Dr. Bolko Stern has written in detail explaining why the copper covered tops of poles (which were lower than the associated pylons) do not relate to electricity or lightning, pointing out that no evidence of anything used to manipulate electricity had been found in Egypt and that this was a magical and not a technical installation.[48]\\r\\nThose exploring fringe theories of ancient technology have suggested that there were electric lights used in Ancient Egypt. Engineers have constructed a working model based on their interpretation of a relief found in the Hathor temple at the Dendera Temple complex.[49] Authors (such as Peter Krassa and Reinhard Habeck) have produced a basic theory of the device's operation.[49] The standard explanation, however, for the Dendera light, which comprises three stone reliefs (one single and a double representation) is that the depicted image represents a lotus leaf and flower from which a sacred snake is spawned in accordance with Egyptian mythological beliefs. This sacred snake sometimes is identified as the Milky Way (the snake) in the night sky (the leaf, lotus, or \\"bulb\\") that became identified with Hathor because of her similar association in creation.\\r\\nUnder Hellenistic rule, Egypt was one of the most prosperous regions of the Hellenistic civilization. The ancient Egyptian city of Rhakotis was renovated as Alexandria, which became the largest city around the Mediterranean Basin. Under Roman rule, Egypt was one of the most prosperous regions of the Roman Empire, with Alexandria being second only to ancient Rome in size.\\r\\nRecent scholarship suggests that the water wheel originates from Ptolemaic Egypt, where it appeared by the 3rd century BC.[50][51] This is seen as an evolution of the paddle-driven water-lifting wheels that had been known in Egypt a century earlier.[50] According to John Peter Oleson, both the compartmented wheel and the hydraulic Noria may have been invented in Egypt by the 4th century BC, with the Sakia being invented there a century later. This is supported by archeological finds at Faiyum, Egypt, where the oldest archeological evidence of a water-wheel has been found, in the form of a Sakia dating back to the 3rd century BC. A papyrus dating to the 2nd century BC also found in Faiyum mentions a water wheel used for irrigation, a 2nd-century BC fresco found at Alexandria depicts a compartmented Sakia, and the writings of Callixenus of Rhodes mention the use of a Sakia in Ptolemaic Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy IV in the late 3rd century BC.[51]\\r\\nAncient Greek technology was often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. Ancient Roman technology is a set of artifacts and customs which supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years.\\r\\nUnder Arab rule, Egypt once again became one of the most prosperous regions around the Mediterranean. The Egyptian city of Cairo was founded by the Fatimid Caliphate and served as its capital city. At the time, Cairo was second only to Baghdad, capital of the rival Abbasid Caliphate. After the fall of Baghdad, however, Cairo overtook it as the largest city in the Mediterranean region until the early modern period.\\r\\nInventions in medieval Islam covers the inventions developed in the medieval Islamic world, a region that extended from Al-Andalus and Africa in the west to the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia in the east.

Formerly found in several countries in East and Central Africa south of the Sahara, this subspecies is a grazer in grasslands and savanna woodlands. As of 19 March 2018 there were only two known rhinos of this subspecies left, both of which are female; barring the existence of unknown or misclassified male northern white rhinos elsewhere in Africa, this makes the subspecies functionally extinct. The two female rhinos belong to the Dv?r Krlov Zoo in the Czech Republic but live in the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya and are protected round-the-clock by armed guards.\\r\\nAccording to the latest International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessment from 2011, the subspecies is considered \\"Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild).\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe zoo population is declining, and northern whites have rarely reproduced in captivity. There are now only two northern white rhinos left:\\r\\nThey both belong to the Dv?r Krlov Zoo in the Czech Republic, but live in Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, Africa.[6] They arrived at the conservancy after an air and road trip on 20 December 2009,[7] along with two male northern white rhinos from the Dv?r Krlov Zoo, Suni and Sudan. However, Suni, a male born at Dv?r Krlov Zoo in 1980, died from natural causes in Ol Pejeta Conservancy in 2014.[8][9] Sudan, caught from the wild in 1975, died on 19 March 2018.[4][10][11]\\r\\nAfter the transport, the four rhinos were under constant watch by specialists and staff, and lived in specially constructed bomas with access to a 400G400-metre paddock area, allowing them to acclimatize to their new surroundings.[citation needed] To prevent any unnecessary injuries they might inflict on each other while interacting in their fenced area, and give their horns an opportunity to regrow to a natural shape (as their front horns had grown bent by much rubbing against enclosure bars in captivity), all the rhinos were sedated and their horns were sawn off. This also made them less vulnerable to the poaching that drove their species to near extinction, as the horn is what the poachers are after. In place of their horns, radio transmitters have been installed to allow closer monitoring of their whereabouts.[12] They are protected round-the-clock by armed guards.[13] Poachers have been selling their horns for $50,000 per kilo.[14]\\r\\nSince May 2010, the northern white rhino male Sudan was moved from the initial holding pens to a much larger 700-acre (2.8?km2) semiwild enclosure. There he roamed among many African animals, including several southern white rhino females and many plains animals. On 26 October 2011, the females were coaxed into the larger enclosure. Because Najin was overly protective of her daughter Fatu's chance at mating, one of the two moved back into the smaller enclosure two weeks later.[citation needed]\\r\\nUntil 2011, the progress of this attempt at saving the northern white rhinoceros was documented on the initiative's website;[15] and their life in Ol Pejeta Conservancy is commented on on the Conservancy's website. Several documentaries are in the works, including an episode of Ol Pejeta Diaries entitled \\"Return of the African Titans\\" for Oasis HD Canada fall 2010, and a follow-up half-hour episode to follow. This translocation was also the subject of a BBC Last Chance to See special entitled \\"Return of the Rhino\\",[16] presented by Stephen Fry and the zoologist Mark Carwardine; the TV program reported at the end that the two pairs of rhinos were \\"flirting\\".\\r\\nOn 25 April 2012 and on 27 May 2012 Suni and Najin mated.[17] Pregnancy of the female rhinos was monitored weekly.[18] Rhinoceros gestation period takes 16 to 18 months,[19] so in January 2014 the Conservancy considered Najin not pregnant, and a male southern white rhino from Lewa Wildlife Conservancy was put to Najin and Fatu enclosure in Ol Pejeta to at least intercross the subspecies. To achieve this, both female northern white rhinos were separated from their male counterparts, which prevented them from producing a pure northern white rhino offspring.[20][21] In 2015, however, tests conducted by Czech specialists revealed that neither of the females are \\"capable of natural reproduction\\".[22][23] According to the director of the Dv?r Krlov Zoo, it was possible Najin became pregnant but miscarried shortly after, which resulted in pathological changes in its uterus, preventing another impregnation.[24]\\r\\nAt the end of 2015, scientists from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, San Diego Zoo Global, Tiergarten Sch?nbrunn, and Dv?r Krlov Zoo developed a plan to reproduce northern white rhinos using natural gametes of the living rhinos and induced pluripotent stem cells. Subsequently, in the future, it might be possible to specifically mature the cells into specific cells such as neurons and muscle cells, in a similar way in which Katsuhiko Hayashi has grown mice out of simple skin cells. The DNA of a dozen northern white rhinos has been preserved in genetic banks in Berlin and San Diego.[25]\\r\\nThe northern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) formerly ranged over parts of northwestern Uganda, southern South Sudan, the eastern part of Central African Republic, and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.[26] Their range possibly extended as far west as Lake Chad, into Chad and Cameroon.[citation needed]\\r\\nPoachers reduced their population from 500 to 15 in the 1970s and 1980s. From the early 1990s through mid-2003, the population recovered to more than 32 animals.[27][28] Since mid-2003, poaching has intensified and further reduced the wild population.[27]\\r\\nThe last known surviving population of wild northern white rhinos was in Garamba National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).[29]\\r\\nIn January 2005, the government of the DRC approved a two-part plan for five northern white rhinos to be moved from Garamba National Park to a wildlife sanctuary in Kenya. The second part commits the government and its international partners to increase conservation efforts in Garamba, so the northern white rhinos can be returned when it is safe again.[30] However, the translocation did not occur.\\r\\nIn August 2005, ground and aerial surveys conducted under the direction of African Parks Foundation and the African Rhino Specialist Group (ARSG) had only found four animals, a solitary adult male and a group of one adult male and two adult females.[31] They were the last known wild northern white rhinos, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature.[32]\\r\\nIn June 2008, it was reported that the species may have gone extinct in the wild, since there has been no sighting of these four known remaining individuals since 2006, or of their signs since 2007, despite intensive systematic ground and aerial searches in 2008.[2][33] One carcass has been found.[2][34][35] On 28 November 2009, two Russian helicopter pilots reported seeing rhinoceroses in southern Sudan.[36] It was assumed that the three rhinos that were spotted belonged to the northern white rhinoceros subspecies, as black rhinos had not lived in the area for a long time and southern white rhinos never lived in southern Sudan.[37] However, as of August 2011, no other sightings have been reported,[2] and this population is now considered to have probably gone extinct.[2]\\r\\nAt the beginning of 2015, the fully captive northern white rhino population consisted of only two animals maintained in two zoological institutions: in the United States (San Diego Zoo Safari Park) and the Czech Republic (Dv?r Krlov Zoo). However, both of them died later the same year, and no zoo in the world has any northern white rhinos any longer.\\r\\nIn 1975, the Dv?r Krlov Zoo, located in Dv?r Krlov nad Labem, Czech Republic, got six northern white rhinos from Sudan and, in later years, two more from English zoos. One rhino from an English zoo arrived pregnant. The Dv?r Krlov Zoo is the only one in the world where northern white rhinos birthed offspring, with the last calf being born in 2000;[38] the current world population consists of their shared descendants.[39][4][5]\\r\\nFormer residents include:\\r\\nDv?r Krlov Zoo sent Suni, Sudan and two females, which are still alive, to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya on 19 December 2009[47] in a joint effort by the zoo, Fauna and Flora International, Back to Africa, Lewa, and Kenya Wildlife Service. Hoping to stimulate the rhinos' sexual appetite, the zoo decided to send them back into their natural habitat in Kenya. The agreement with the Kenyan government expects the rhinos never to be returned to the Czech Republic.\\r\\nThe female named Nabire stayed in Dv?r Krlov Zoo, because, as Jan Stejskal, a projects coordinator at the zoo, stated, \\"she is no longer capable of breeding naturally. But it seems she has one healthy ovary and this could provide us with material from which to create an embryo in artificial conditions.\\"[38] Efforts to do so began in autumn 2014.[48] Immediately after the death of Nabire in 2015, her ovary with four oocytes was removed and transferred to a laboratory in Cremona, Italy. The laboratory was able to extract two egg cells and fertilise them. However, without consulting the Dv?r Krlov Zoo, the semen of a southern white rhino was used instead of a northern white rhino, which the zoo considers a wasted opportunity.[49]\\r\\nThe San Diego Zoo Safari Park in San Diego, California, had eight wild-caught northern white rhinos.[50][5]\\r\\nFormer residents include:\\r\\nThe San Diego Wild Animal Park provided Angalifu's semen to female rhinos at the Dv?r Krlov Zoo but the insemination attempts were unsuccessful.

The Fratellis torture Chunk until he reveals where the Goonies have gone, and begin pursuit. Chunk is left behind with Sloth, but befriends him. Sloth frees them, and Chunk calls the police. They both then follow the Fratellis.\\r\\nThe Goonies evade several deadly traps along the tunnels while staying ahead of the Fratellis. Finally, they reach the grotto where Willy's pirate ship, the Inferno, is anchored. The kids discover the ship is filled with treasure and start filling their pockets; Mikey warns them not to take any on a set of scales in front of Willy, considering that to be Willy's treasure and their tribute to him. As they leave the ship, the Fratellis appear and demand they drop all the treasure before they plan to kill them. Chunk arrives with Sloth and distract the Fratellis long enough for the Goonies to jump overboard. Sloth holds open a cave opening so they can escape the grotto, but has to stay behind. With the children gone, the Fratellis proceed to grab all the treasure they can, including those on Willy's scales. This triggers another trap causing the grotto to collapse, and the Fratellis barely make it out in time.\\r\\nOn shore, the Goonies see their families and the police arrive, capturing the Fratellis when they get to shore, but Chunk prevents Sloth from being arrested. As the kids eagerly describe their adventure to their parents, Mikey discovers that his marble bag had not been taken by the Fratellis and is filled with gems he took from the ship. Mikey's father rips up the foreclosure papers, declaring they have enough money to buy their homes back. Chunk invites Sloth to live with him. As the Goonies celebrate, they see the Inferno, having broken free of the grotto, sailing off on its own in the distance.\\r\\nDirector Richard Donner makes a cameo appearance as a deputy.[4]\\r\\nPrincipal photography on The Goonies began on October 22, 1984 and lasted five months. There was an additional six weeks of audio dubbing recording.[5] The shooting script was lengthy, at more than 120 pages, and several sequences were eventually cut from the final theatrical version. During the film's dnouement, mention is made of an octopus which refers to a scene that was excised from the final cut.\\r\\nIn The Making of The Goonies, director Richard Donner notes the difficulties and pleasures of working with so many child actors. Donner praises them for their energy and excitement, but says that they were unruly when brought together. The documentary frequently shows him coaching the young actors and reveals some techniques he used to get realistic performances. One of these tricks involved One-Eyed Willy's ship, which was actually a full-sized mock-up of a pirate ship created under the direction of production designer J. Michael Riva. Donner restricted the child actors from seeing the ship until they filmed the scene wherein it is revealed to their characters. The characters' first glimpse of the ship was thus also the actors' first view of it, bringing about a more realistic performance. However, that particular scene in the movie is actually the second take, as the cast was so overwhelmed at first sight that the scene had to be re-shot. It was later noted that the entire set was scrapped after shooting because they could not find anyone who wanted it.[6]\\r\\nIn his book There and Back Again, Sean Astin claims that Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg were \\"like codirectors\\" on the film as he compares and contrasts their styles when directing scenes.[7]\\r\\nSome of the on-location filming was done in Astoria, Oregon. The interior and exterior of the old Clatsop County Jail features as the holding place of Jake Fratelli at the start of the film. (The building was later converted into the Oregon Film Museum, which opened on the 25th anniversary of The Goonies with memorabilia from this and other local films.)[8] The museum where Mikey's father works is, in reality, the Captain George Flavel House Museum. The Walsh family home is a real home on the eastern end of the town.[8] The scenes along the coast were filmed in Oregon, but they were a considerable distance from Astoria. The Goonies bicycle to Ecola State Park (in reality, over 26 miles south of Astoria) and then find the starting location of the map using Haystack Rock as a guide. Underground scenes were filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, including the cavernous set where the Goonies find One-Eyed Willy's ship, which was in Stage 16, one of the largest sound stages in America.[9] The final scene was shot at Goat Rock State Beach in Sonoma County, California.[10][11][12]\\r\\nThe film marked Wes Takahashi's first major motion picture as an animation supervisor for Industrial Light & Magic.[13]\\r\\nThe Goonies: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack features music by Cyndi Lauper, REO Speedwagon, The Bangles, and others. The cast members (except Kerri Green) appeared alongside professional wrestlers \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper and \\"Captain\\" Lou Albano in the 12 minute \\"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\\" music video. Steven Spielberg makes a cameo appearance. Lauper also has a cameo in the film, performing the song on TV, although the song was not completed until after filming.\\r\\nDave Grusin's score was unavailable for 25 years. The main theme, \\"Fratelli Chase\\", has been used in numerous trailers, such as Innerspace and Guarding Tess, and was re-recorded by Grusin and the London Symphony Orchestra for the album Cinemagic. The score makes liberal use of the Max Steiner-composed theme from Adventures of Don Juan.[14]\\r\\nSoundtrack label Varse Sarabande released the score in March 2010 in a limited edition of 5000 copies.\\r\\nWarner Bros. released the film in cinemas in the United States on June 7, 1985. The Goonies grossed US$9 million in its opening weekend in the US, second on the charts behind Rambo: First Blood Part II.[15] It grossed more than US$61 million that year, placing it among the top ten highest-grossing films of 1985 in the US.[16]\\r\\nThe Goonies was first released on VHS and Betamax video in the United States in March 1986 and the LaserDisc and CED versions also debuted that year. Warner Home Video released a theatrical widescreen laserdisc on January 29, 1992. Warner Home Video released The Goonies in widescreen on Region 1 DVD on August 21, 2001.[17] Warner Home Video released The Goonies on Blu-ray Disc in October 2008 in Europe and November 2010 in North America. The video is in 1080p high definition VC-1 and accompanied by a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.\\r\\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 70% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 46 reviews; the average rating is 6.1/10. The critical consensus: \\"An energetic, sometimes noisy mix of Spielbergian sentiment and funhouse tricks that will appeal to kids and nostalgic adults alike.\\"[18] At Metacritic it has a rating score of 60, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".[19] Several reviewers noted that the film appeared to be enjoyable for children and teens, but not so much for adults.[20]\\r\\nRamsey won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role.[21] At the 7th Youth in Film Awards (now known as Young Artist Awards), Astin's portrayal of Mikey won the award for Best Starring Performance By a Young Actor in a Motion Picture. Cohen, Feldman, and Plimpton were also nominated for awards for their performances in The Goonies. The film itself was nominated for best adventure motion picture.[22]\\r\\nThe city of Astoria has hosted special anniversary events for the film, with around 10,000 to 15,000 visitors coming to the city to celebrate the film during these events.[23] The home used for the Walsh family had become a tourist attraction, receiving between 1,200 and 1,500 visitors a day during the summer of the 30th anniversary, and in August 2015 the residents and owners of the home, their neighbors, and the city of Astoria have taken steps to limit public access to the home due to this.[24]\\r\\nDatasoft produced a Goonies video game for Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit family and Apple II in 1985, which was later ported to the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC by U.S. Gold.[25][26] This game features eight screens in which a player had to use two members of the Goonies group to solve puzzles and reach an exit to advance to the next stage. The screens were largely inspired by actual sets and puzzles seen in the film. A reference to the aforementioned \\"octopus scene\\" is included, as the seventh level.\\r\\nIn 1986, Japanese game developer Konami created two versions of The Goonies for the MSX (The Goonies) in Japan and Europe, and Family Computer (The Goonies) in Japan. The Goonies II was also released on the Famicom (and its international counterpart, the Nintendo Entertainment System). The Goonies II was released in North America, Europe and Australia, although the original was one of the NES games released as part of the Nintendo VS. System arcade machine in the 1980s. The Goonies II has little to do with the film. In it, the Fratellis have kidnapped all the Goonies (except Mikey, whom the player guides) and have hidden them in cages across a terrain of caverns, mazes and abandoned buildings. As Mikey, the player must rescue them all and ultimately free a mermaid named Annie.\\r\\nIn February 2007, Chrysler's Jeep division sponsored The Goonies: Return to Astoria, a Flash-based game, developed by Fuel Industries. The player's goal is to collect map pieces and doubloons, and then race the Fratellis to One-Eyed Willy's treasure.[27][28]\\r\\nA Goonies level pack for Lego Dimensions was released on May 9, 2017. The pack includes a Sloth minifigure and constructable Pirate Ship and Skeleton Organ, and unlocks a bonus level that adapts the plot of the film.[29]\\r\\nRichard Donner[30]\\r\\nThe possibility of a film sequel has been confirmed and denied many times in recent years by the original cast and crew. Donner said that he had a story he liked and Spielberg behind him, but in 2004 several of the actors from the original revealed that Warner Bros., the film's owner, had shown no interest in a sequel.[31] Sean Astin told MTV in October 2007 that Goonies 2 \\"is an absolute certainty?... The writing's on the wall when they're releasing the DVD in such numbers.\\"[32] Donner has expressed doubt that the sequel will ever happen, as many of the actors had not shown interest in returning for a sequel.[33] Corey Feldman stated in his November 25, 2008 blog post, \\"NO! There is no Goonies 2! I'm sorry but it's just not gonna happen?.... Course now that I've said that, they'll do it.\\"[34] However, on the July 2010 release of The Making of a Cult Classic: The Unauthorized Story of The Goonies DVD,[35] Richard Donner states a sequel to The Goonies is a \\"definite thing\\" and will involve as much of the old cast as possible. \\"It will happen,\\" says Donner. \\"We've been trying for a number of years.\\"[36] On April 5, 2014, Richard Donner revealed a sequel is in the works, and he hopes to bring back the entire cast.[37]\\r\\nRumors of adaptations and sequels in other media took off in 2007, including a comic book miniseries,[38] an animated television series, and a musical adaptation of the film. Corey Feldman said he was asked to reprise the role of Mouth in a cartoon series that would feature the original Goonies characters as adults and focus on the adventures of a new set of kids.[39] Apparently this project was briefly in the works for Cartoon Network before being shelved.[40] Entertainment Weekly reported in March 2007 on a potential musical adaptation of the film. \\"Steven and I have discussed it, and it's something that I'm fairly passionate about right now,\\" Donner says.[41] Variety reported in October 2008 that Donner had met with Broadway entertainment attorney John Breglio, and is \\"confident things are moving in the right direction.\\"[30] As of May 2011, the musical was still in the beginning stages, but Donner was hopeful that an \\"irreverent\\" script would be completed by October.[42]","input":"Who is the main character in the goonies?"},{"output":"Christina Alexandra \\"Chrystia\\" Freeland","context":"Christina Alexandra \\"Chrystia\\" Freeland[1] PC MP (born August 2, 1968) is a Canadian writer, journalist, and politician.

After winning the Liberal nomination on September 15, 2013, she was elected to parliament in the November 25, 2013 by-election. Appointed to the Cabinet of Canada as Minister of International Trade on November 4, 2015, Freeland was named that month as one of Toronto's 50 most influential by Toronto Life magazine.[2] On January 10, 2017, Freeland was appointed the Minister of Foreign Affairs.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeland is the author of Sale of the Century, a 2000 book about Russia's journey from communism to capitalism[4] and Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else in 2012.[5][6] Plutocrats was a New York Times bestseller, and the winner of the 2013 Lionel Gelber Prize for non-fiction reporting on foreign affairs.[7] It also won the 2013 National Business Book Award for the most outstanding Canadian business-related book.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeland was born in Peace River, Alberta.[8][9] Her father, Donald Freeland, was a farmer and lawyer and a member of the Liberal Party of Canada,[10] and her mother, Halyna (Chomiak) Freeland (1946ÿ2007), was also a lawyer who ran for election in Edmonton Strathcona in the 1988 federal election, representing the New Democratic Party.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeland's paternal grandfather, Wilbur Freeland, was a farmer and lawyer who rode in the Calgary Stampede, and whose sister, Beulah, was the wife of federal MP Ged Baldwin.[13] Her paternal grandmother, Helen (Caulfield) Freeland, was a WWII war bride from Glasgow.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeland's mother, Halyna Chomiak, was born in a displaced persons camp in Bad W?rishofen, Germany, to Ukrainian Catholic parents, Mykhailo Khomiak (Anglicized as Michael Chomiak), born in Stroniatyn, Galicia, and Alexandra (Loban) Chomiak, originally of Rudniki near Iwano-Frankivsk (Stanislawow).[11][15] As Ukraine experienced democratic backsliding from the 1990s, Freeland, who grew up in Alberta, saw \\"firsthand\\" the consequences, through her mother's activism as a \\"prominent member of the Ukrainian Canadian community.\\"[16] Freeland's maternal grandfather, Mykhailo Khomiak in Ukrainian, was the editor-in-chief of a Ukrainian-language pro-Nazi newspaper called Krakivs'ki visti launched in Krak܇w in occupied Poland during World War II, with exposure orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels himself.[17] Michael Chomiak has been characterized by the Canadian press as a \\"Nazi collaborator\\".[18][19][20] Freeland and others have claimed that the circulation of news in 2017 regarding her grandfather's connection to Nazism was the result of a Russian disinformation campaign;[21][20][22] nevertheless, these facts have been confirmed by the University of Alberta historian and Chomiak's son-in-law, Professor John-Paul Himka.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeland attended the United World College of the Adriatic in Italy.[23] She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Russian history and literature from Harvard University and a Master of Studies degree in Slavonic Studies from St Antony's College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar in 1993.[4][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeland started her journalism career as a stringer for the Financial Times, The Washington Post and The Economist while working in Ukraine.[25] Freeland later worked for the Financial Times in London as a deputy editor, and then as an editor for its weekend edition, FT.com, and UK news.[25] Freeland also served as Moscow bureau chief and Eastern Europe correspondent for the Financial Times.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1999 to 2001 Freeland served as the deputy editor of The Globe and Mail.[25] Next she worked as the managing director and editor of consumer news at Thomson Reuters.[26] She was also a weekly columnist for the Globe and Mail.[27] Previously she was editor of Thomson Reuters Digital, a position she held since April 2011.[28] Prior to that she was the global editor-at-large of Reuters news since March 1, 2010,[29] having formerly been the United States managing editor at the Financial Times, based in New York City.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeland is the author of Sale of the Century, a 2000 book about Russia's journey from communism to capitalism[4] and Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else in 2012.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlutocrats was a New York Times bestseller, and the winner of the 2013 Lionel Gelber Prize for non-fiction reporting on foreign affairs.[7] It also won the 2013 National Business Book Award for the most outstanding Canadian business-related book.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 26, 2013 Freeland left journalism to enter Canadian politics as a candidate for the nomination of the Liberal Party in the riding of Toronto Centre. On September 15, 2013 she won the nomination,[30] with an opportunity to replace outgoing MP Bob Rae in the November 25, 2013 by-election.[31] During the campaign she received criticism for purchasing a 1.3 million dollar home, although the price was consistent with Toronto's home prices.[32][33] Freeland won 49% of the vote and was elected.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Liberal Party of Canada's trade critic,[35] Freeland interviewed noted economist Larry Summers in a formal event at the 2014 Liberal Party convention;[36] the interview is available on YouTube and the party website.

At the start of the war, the French colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers, compared with 2 million in the British colonies.[4] The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European nations declared a wider war upon one another overseas in 1756, two years into the French and Indian war, and some view the French and Indian War as being merely the American theater of the worldwide Seven Years' War of 1756ÿ63; however, the French and Indian War is viewed in America as a singular conflict which was not associated with any European war. The name French and Indian War is used mainly in the United States, referring to the two enemies of the British colonists, while European historians use the term the Seven Years' War, as do English-speaking Canadians.[5] French Canadians call it Guerre de la Conqute (the War of the Conquest)[6][7] or (rarely) the Fourth Intercolonial War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois, Catawba, and  Cherokee, and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy members Abenaki and Mi'kmaq, and Algonquin, Lenape, Ojibwa, Ottawa, Shawnee, and Wyandot. Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies, from Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north. It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River called the Forks of the Ohio, and the site of the French Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754, during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22 year-old George Washington ambushed a French patrol.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1755, six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock, the newly arrived British Army commander, and planned a four-way attack on the French.  None succeeded, and the main effort by Braddock proved a disaster; he lost the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9, 1755 and died a few days later. British operations failed in the frontier areas of the Province of Pennsylvania and the Province of New York during 1755ÿ57 due to a combination of poor management, internal divisions, effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies. In 1755, the British captured Fort Beausjour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia, and they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians (1755ÿ64) soon afterwards. Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley, Commander-in-Chief, North America, without direction from Great Britain. The Acadians were expelled, both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty. Indians likewise were driven off the land to make way for settlers from New England.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British colonial government fell in the region of Nova Scotia after several disastrous campaigns in 1757, including a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry; this last was followed by Indians torturing and massacring their British victims. William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces that they had in New France, preferring to concentrate their forces against Prussia and its allies who were now engaged in the Seven Years' War in Europe. Between 1758 and 1760, the British military launched a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada (part of New France). They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately the city of Quebec (1759). The British later lost the Battle of Sainte-Foy west of Quebec (1760), but the French ceded Canada in accordance with the Treaty of Paris (1763).\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance ceded its territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain. It ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (including New Orleans) to its ally Spain in compensation for Spain's loss to Britain of Spanish Florida. (Spain had ceded Florida to Britain in exchange for the return of Havana, Cuba.) France's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, confirming Great Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn British America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War. There had already been a King George's War in the 1740s during the reign of King George II, so British colonists named this conflict after their opponents, and it became known as the French and Indian War.[9] This continues as the standard name for the war in the United States, although Indians fought on both sides of the conflict. It also led into the Seven Years' War overseas, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain that did not involve the American colonies; some historians make a connection between the French and Indian War and the Seven Years' War overseas, but most residents of the United States consider them as two separate conflictsonly one of which involved the American colonies,[10] and American historians generally use the traditional name. Less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Europe, the French and Indian War is conflated into the Seven Years' War and not given a separate name. \\"Seven Years\\" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756two years after the French and Indian War had startedto the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. The French and Indian War in America, by contrast, was largely concluded in six years from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadians conflate both the European and American conflicts into the Seven Years' War (Guerre de Sept Ans).[11][12] French Canadians also use the term \\"War of Conquest\\" (Guerre de la Conqute), since it is the war in which Canada was conquered by the British and became part of the British Empire. In Quebec, this term was promoted by popular historians Jacques Lacoursire and Denis Vaugeois, who borrowed from the ideas of Maurice Sguin in considering this war as a dramatic tipping point of French Canadian identity and nationhood.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time, America east of the Mississippi River was largely claimed by either Great Britain or France. Large areas had no colonial settlements. The French population numbered about 75,000 and was heavily concentrated along the St. Lawrence River valley, with some also in Acadia (present-day New Brunswick and parts of Nova Scotia), including ?le Royale (Cape Breton Island). Fewer lived in New Orleans, Biloxi, Mississippi, Mobile, Alabama, and small settlements in the Illinois Country, hugging the east side of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. French fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds, did business with local Indian tribes, and often married Indian women.[14] Traders married daughters of chiefs, creating high-ranking unions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish settlers outnumbered the French 20 to 1[15] with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent from Nova Scotia and the Colony of Newfoundland in the north to the Province of Georgia in the south.[16] Many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west, as the extent of the continent was unknown at the time when their provincial charters were granted. Their population centers were along the coast, yet the settlements were growing into the interior. Nova Scotia had been captured from France in 1713, and it still had a significant French-speaking population. Britain also claimed Rupert's Land where the Hudson's Bay Company traded for furs with local Indian tribes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn between the French and British colonists, large areas were dominated by Indian tribes. To the north, the Mi'kmaqs and the Abenakis were engaged in Father Le Loutre's War and still held sway in parts of Nova Scotia, Acadia, and the eastern portions of the province of Canada, as well as much of Maine.[17] The Iroquois Confederation dominated much of upstate New York and the Ohio Country, although Ohio also included Algonquian-speaking populations of Delaware and Shawnee, as well as Iroquoian-speaking Mingos. These tribes were formally under Iroquois rule and were limited by them in their authority to make agreements.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan-speaking Catawbas, Muskogee-speaking Creeks and Choctaw, and the Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee tribes.[19] When war broke out, the French colonists used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region, which was not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British; these included the Hurons, Mississaugs, Ojibwas, Winnebagos, and Potawatomi. The British colonists were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations and also by the Cherokees, until differences sparked the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1758. In 1758, the Province of Pennsylvania successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creeks and Cherokees were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time, Spain claimed only the province of Florida in eastern America; it controlled Cuba and other territories in the West Indies that became military objectives in the Seven Years' War. Florida's European population was a few hundred, concentrated in St. Augustine and Pensacola.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start of the war, no French regular army troops were stationed in America, and few British troops. New France was defended by about 3,000 troupes de la marine, companies of colonial regulars (some of whom had significant woodland combat experience). The colonial government recruited militia support when needed. Most of the British colonies mustered local militia companies to deal with Indian threats, generally ill trained and available only for short periods, but they did not have any standing forces. Virginia, by contrast, had a large frontier with several companies of British regulars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonial governments were used to operating independently of one another and of the government in London, a situation that complicated negotiations with Indian tribes, whose territories often encompassed land claimed by multiple colonies. After the war began, the leaders of the British Army establishment tried to impose constraints and demands on the colonial administrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew France's Governor-General Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissonire was concerned about the incursion and expanding influence in the Ohio Country of British colonial traders such as George Croghan.  In June 1747, he ordered Pierre-Joseph Cloron to lead a military expedition through the area. Its objectives were:\\r\\n\\r\\nCloron's expedition force consisted of about 200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians, and they covered about 3,000 miles (4,800?km) between June and November 1749. They went up the St. Lawrence, continued along the northern shore of Lake Ontario, crossed the portage at Niagara, and followed the southern shore of Lake Erie. At the Chautauqua Portage near Barcelona, New York, the expedition moved inland to the Allegheny River, which it followed to the site of Pittsburgh. There Cloron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country.[20] Whenever he encountered British colonial merchants or fur-traders, he informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nCloron's expedition arrived at Logstown where the Indians in the area informed him that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British colonists regardless of the French.[21] He continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the Ohio and the Miami rivers, which lay just south of the village of Pickawillany, the home of the Miami chief known as \\"Old Briton\\". Cloron threatened Old Briton with severe consequences if he continued to trade with British colonists, but Old Briton ignored the warning. Cloron returned disappointedly to Montreal in November 1749.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nCloron wrote an extensively detailed report. \\"All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French,\\" he wrote, \\"and are entirely devoted to the English. I don't know in what way they could be brought back.\\"[21] Even before his return to Montreal, reports on the situation in the Ohio Country were making their way to London and Paris, each side proposing that action be taken. Massachusetts governor William Shirley was particularly forceful, stating that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1749, the British government gave land to the Ohio Company of Virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the Ohio Country.[24] The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory and construct a fort for their protection. But the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania, and both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims.[25] In 1750, Christopher Gist explored the Ohio territory, acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company, and he opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown.[26] He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians agreed to terms through their \\"Half-King\\" Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative. These terms included permission to build a strong house at the mouth of the Monongahela River on the modern site of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[27] By the late 17th century, the Iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the Ohio Valley, and they laid claim to it as their hunting ground by right of conquest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe War of the Austrian Succession (better known as King George's War) formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe. The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies were turned over to a commission, but it reached no decision. Frontier areas were claimed by both sides, from Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north to the Ohio Country in the south. The disputes also extended into the Atlantic Ocean, where both powers wanted access to the rich fisheries of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor-General of New France Marquis de la Jonquire died on March 17, 1752, and he was temporarily replaced by Charles le Moyne de Longueuil. His permanent replacement was to be the Marquis Duquesne, but he did not arrive in New France until 1752 to take over the post.[28] The continuing British activity in the Ohio territories prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade, an officer in the Troupes de la Marine. Langlade was given 300 men, including French-Canadians and warriors of the Ottawa tribe. His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following Cloron's orders to cease trading with the British. On June 21, the French war party attacked the trading centre at Pickawillany, capturing three traders[22] and killing 14 Miami Indians, including Old Briton. He was reportedly ritually cannibalized by some Indians in the expedition party.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians. His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British. Marin followed the route that Cloron had mapped out four years earlier. Cloron, however, had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, whereas Marin constructed and garrisoned forts. He first constructed Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie's south shore near Erie, Pennsylvania, and he had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. He then constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf in Waterford, Pennsylvania, designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson was a chief of the Mingo Indians, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. He intensely disliked the French whom he accused of killing and eating his father. He traveled to Fort Le Boeuf and threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Iroquois sent runners to the manor of William Johnson in upstate New York, who was the British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the New York region and beyond. Johnson was known to the Iroquois as Warraghiggey, meaning \\"he who does great things.\\" He spoke their languages and had become a respected honorary member of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area, and he was made a colonel of the Iroquois in 1746; he was later commissioned as a colonel of the Western New York Militia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian representatives and Johnson met with Governor Clinton and officials from some of the other American colonies at Albany, New York. Mohawk Chief Hendrick was the speaker of their tribal council, and he insisted that the British abide by their obligations[which?] and block French expansion. Clinton did not respond to his satisfaction, and Hendrick said that the \\"Covenant Chain\\" was broken, a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia was an investor in the Ohio Company, which stood to lose money if the French held their claim.[30] He ordered 21 year-old Major George Washington (whose brother was another Ohio Company investor) of the Virginia Regiment to warn the French to leave Virginia territory in October 1753.[31] Washington left with a small party, picking up Jacob Van Braam as an interpreter, Christopher Gist (a company surveyor working in the area), and a few Mingos led by Tanaghrisson. On December 12, Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nJacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre succeeded Marin as commander of the French forces after Marin died on October 29, and he invited Washington to dine with him. Over dinner, Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country. Saint-Pierre said, \\"As to the Summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it.\\"[34] He told Washington that France's claim to the region was superior to that of the British, since Ren-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nWashington's party left Fort Le Boeuf early on December 16 and arrived in Williamsburg on January 16, 1754. He stated in his report, \\"The French had swept south\\",[36] detailing the steps which they had taken to fortify the area, and their intention to fortify the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before Washington returned, Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under William Trent to that point where they began construction of a small stockaded fort in the early months of 1754.[38] Governor Duquesne sent additional French forces under Claude-Pierre Pecaudy de Contrec?ur to relieve Saint-Pierre during the same period, and Contrec?ur led 500 men south from Fort Venango on April 5, 1754.[39] These forces arrived at the fort on April 16, but Contrec?ur generously allowed Trent's small company to withdraw. He purchased their construction tools to continue building what became Fort Duquesne.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nDinwiddie had ordered Washington to lead a larger force to assist Trent in his work, and Washington learned of Trent's retreat while he was en route.[41] Mingo sachem Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British, so Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with him. He then learned of a French scouting party in the area, so he combined Tanaghrisson's force with his own and surprised the Canadians on May 28 in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen. They killed many of the Canadians, including their commanding officer Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk. Historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and to regain authority over his own people. They had been inclined to support the French, with whom they had long trading relationships. One of Tanaghrisson's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians generally consider the Battle of Jumonville Glen as the opening battle of the French and Indian War in North America, and the start of hostilities in the Ohio valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the battle, Washington pulled back several miles and established Fort Necessity, which the Canadians attacked under the command of Jummonville's brother at the Battle of Fort Necessity on July 3. Washington surrendered and negotiated a withdrawal under arms. One of his men reported that the Canadian force was accompanied by Shawnee, Delaware, and Mingo warriorsjust those whom Tanaghrisson was seeking to influence.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nNews of the two battles reached England in August. After several months of negotiations, the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French.[44] They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition.[45] Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock's departure for North America. In response, King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755.[46] The British sent out their fleet in February 1755, intending to blockade French ports, but the French fleet had already sailed. Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America in an attempt to intercept them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a second British action, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on June 8, 1755, capturing her and two troop ships.[47] The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755, seizing ships and capturing seamen. These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the Albany Congress in June and July, 1754.  The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians, since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the war that was unfolding.  The plan that the delegates agreed to was neither ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown.  Nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British formed an aggressive plan of operations for 1755. General Braddock was to lead the expedition to Fort Duquesne,[49] while Massachusetts governor William Shirley was given the task of fortifying Fort Oswego and attacking Fort Niagara. Sir William Johnson was to capture Fort St. Frdric at Crown Point, New York,[50] and Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton was to capture Fort Beausjour to the east on the frontier between Nova Scotia and Acadia.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nBraddock led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on the Braddock expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne, with George Washington as one of his aides. The expedition was a disaster. It was attacked by French soldiers and Indian warriors ambushing them from hiding places up in trees and behind logs, and Braddock called for a retreat. He was killed and approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured.[49] The remaining 500 British troops retreated to Virginia, led by Washington. Washington and Thomas Gage played key roles in organizing the retreattwo future opponents in the American Revolutionary War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government initiated a plan to increase their military capability in preparation for war following news of Braddock's defeat and the start of parliament's session in November 1755. Among the early legislative measures were the Recruiting Act 1756,[52] the Commissions to Foreign Protestants Act 1756[53] for the Royal American Regiment, the Navigation Act 1756,[54] and the Continuance of Acts 1756.[55] England passed the Naval Prize Act 1756 following the proclamation of war on May 17 to allow the capture of ships and establish privateering.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French acquired a copy of the British war plans, including the activities of Shirley and Johnson. Shirley's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties, exacerbated by his inexperience in managing large expeditions. In conjunction, he was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence when he planned to attack Fort Niagara. As a response, he left garrisons at Oswego, Fort Bull, and Fort Williams, the last two located on the Oneida Carry between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek at Rome, New York. Supplies were cached at Fort Bull for use in the projected attack on Niagara.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson's expedition was better organized than Shirley's, which was noticed by New France's governor the Marquis de Vaudreuil. He had been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio, and he had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley's expected attack. Vaudreuil saw Johnson as the larger threat and sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frdric to meet that threat. Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River, but Johnson had strongly fortified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack. The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry. The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after the British captured it in 1759).\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Monckton captured Fort Beausjour in June 1755 in the sole British success that year, cutting off the French Fortress Louisbourg from land-based reinforcements. To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia's Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French-speaking Acadian population from the area. Monckton's forces, including companies of Rogers' Rangers, forcibly removed thousands of Acadians, chasing down many who resisted and sometimes committing atrocities. Cutting off supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise.[57] The Acadian resistance was sometimes quite stiff, in concert with Indian allies including the Mi'kmaq, with ongoing frontier raids against Dartmouth and Lunenburg, among others. The only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757, other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians ranging around the Bay of Fundy, on the Petitcodiac and St. John rivers, and ?le Saint-Jean.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the death of Braddock, William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America, and he laid out his plans for 1756 at a meeting in Albany in December 1755. He proposed renewing the efforts to capture Niagara, Crown Point, and Duquesne, with attacks on Fort Frontenac on the north shore of Lake Ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudire River to attack the city of Quebec. His plan, however, got bogged down by disagreements and disputes with others, including William Johnson and New York's Governor Sir Charles Hardy, and consequently gained little support.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewcastle replaced him in January 1756 with Lord Loudoun, with Major General James Abercrombie as his second in command. Neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers whom France sent to North America.[48] French regular army reinforcements arrived in New France in May 1756, led by Major General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and seconded by the Chevalier de Lvis and Colonel Fran?ois-Charles de Bourlamaque, all experienced veterans from the War of the Austrian Succession. On May 18, 1756, England formally declared war on France, which expanded the war into Europe and came to be known as the Seven Years' War.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Vaudreuil had ambitions to become the French commander in chief, in addition to his role as governor, and he acted during the winter of 1756 before those reinforcements arrived. Scouts had reported the weakness of the British supply chain, so he ordered an attack against the forts which Shirley had erected at the Oneida Carry. In the Battle of Fort Bull, French forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies, including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder. They set back any British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario and endangered the Oswego garrison, already short on supplies. French forces in the Ohio valley also continued to intrigue with Indians throughout the area, encouraging them to raid frontier settlements. This led to ongoing alarms along the western frontiers, with streams of refugees returning east to get away from the action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new British command was not in place until July. Abercrombie arrived in Albany but refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them, and Montcalm took bold action against his inertia. He built on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison and executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga, as if to presage another attack along Lake George. With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August. In the aftermath, Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects. The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables, which angered the Indians.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoudoun was a capable administrator but a cautious field commander, and he planned one major operation for 1757: an attack on New France's capital of Quebec. He left a sizable force at Fort William Henry to distract Montcalm and began organizing for the expedition to Quebec. He was then ordered to attack Louisbourg first by William Pitt, the Secretary of State responsible for the colonies. The expedition was beset by delays of all kinds but was finally ready to sail from Halifax, Nova Scotia in early August. In the meantime, French ships had escaped the British blockade of the French coast, and a fleet awaited Loudoun at Louisbourg which outnumbered the British fleet. Faced with this strength, Loudoun returned to New York amid news that a massacre had occurred at Fort William Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians) harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757. In January, they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga. In February, they launched a raid against the position across the frozen Lake George, destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification. In early August, Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort, which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole. When the withdrawal began, some of Montcalm's Indian allies attacked the British column because they were angry about the lost opportunity for loot, killing and capturing several hundred men, women, children, and slaves. The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations, as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward. Modern writer William Nester believes that the Indians might have been exposed to European carriers, although no proof exists.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nVaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758, as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping. The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757, a difficult winter, and the allegedly corrupt machinations of Fran?ois Bigot, the intendant of the territory. His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western Indian tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. The disease probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle;[59] yet the Indians blamed the French for bringing \\"bad medicine\\" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry.\\r\\n\\r\\nMontcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence, with primary defenses at Carillon, Quebec, and Louisbourg, while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years.[60] The British failures in North America combined with other failures in the European theater and led to Newcastle's fall from power along with the Duke of Cumberland, his principal military advisor.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning. He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun. He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757. Pitt's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France. Two of the expeditions were successful, with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Forbes Expedition was a British campaign in SeptemberÿOctober 1758, with 6,000 troops led by General John Forbes sent to drive out the French from the contested Ohio Country. The French withdrew from Fort Duquesne and left the British in control of the Ohio River Valley.[61] The great French fortress at Louisbourg in Nova Scotia was captured after a siege.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third invasion was stopped with the improbable French victory in the Battle of Carillon, in which 3,600 Frenchmen defeated Abercrombie's force of 18,000 regulars, militia, and Indian allies outside the fort which the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga. Abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent John Bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac, including caches of supplies destined for New France's western forts and furs destined for Europe. Abercrombie was recalled and replaced by Jeffery Amherst, victor at Louisbourg.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French had generally poor results in 1758 in most theaters of the war. The new foreign minister was the duc de Choiseul, and he decided to focus on an invasion of Britain to draw British resources away from North America and the European mainland. The invasion failed both militarily and politically, as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France and sent funds to Britain's mainland ally of Prussia, while the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay. In one piece of good fortune, some French supply ships did manage to depart France and elude the British blockade of the French coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish victories continued in all theaters in the Annus Mirabilis of 1759: the British captured Ticonderoga, James Wolfe defeated Montcalm at Quebec in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders, and a British victory at Fort Niagara cut off the French frontier forts to the west and south. The victory was made complete in 1760; the British did suffer a defeat outside Quebec City in the Battle of Sainte-Foy, but they prevented the arrival of French relief ships in the naval Battle of the Restigouche while armies marched on Montreal from three sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Vaudreuil in Montreal negotiated a capitulation with General Amherst in September 1760. Amherst granted his requests that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition, to own property, and to remain undisturbed in their homes. The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers, and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the fighting ended in continental North America in 1760, although it continued in Europe between France and Britain. The notable exception was the French seizure of St. John's, Newfoundland. General Amherst heard of this surprise action and immediately dispatched troops under his nephew William Amherst, who regained control of Newfoundland after the Battle of Signal Hill in September 1762.[64] Many troops from North America were reassigned to participate in further British actions in the West Indies, including the capture of Spanish Havana when Spain belatedly entered the conflict on the side of France, and a British expedition against French Martinique in 1762 led by Major General Robert Monckton.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Amherst also oversaw the transition of French forts to British control in the western lands. The policies which he introduced in those lands disturbed large numbers of Indians and contributed to Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763.[66] This series of attacks on frontier forts and settlements required the continued deployment of British troops, and it was not resolved until 1766.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe war in North America officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763, and war in the European theater was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763. The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British. France chose to cede the former but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow. The British, however, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue; they also had ample places from which to obtain sugar. Spain traded Florida to Britain in order to regain Cuba, but they also gained Louisiana from France, including New Orleans, in compensation for their losses. Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe war changed economic, political, governmental, and social relations among the three European powers, their colonies, and the people who inhabited those territories. France and Britain both suffered financially because of the war, with significant long-term consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritain gained control of French Canada and Acadia, colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French-speaking Roman Catholic residents. The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 made land available to immigrants from Europe and migrants from the colonies to the south. The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces, but many went to France, and some went to New Orleans, which they had expected to remain French. Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands, but these efforts were unsuccessful. Others migrated to places such as Saint-Domingue or fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution. The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population. (The French word \\"Acadien\\" changed to \\"Cadien\\" then to \\"Cajun\\".)[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the treaty, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763 which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and it continues to govern relations to some extent between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population,[70] a demarcation that was only a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers.[71] The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians.[72] The Quebec Act addressed this and other issues in 1774, raising concerns in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \\"popery.\\" The Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seven Years' War nearly doubled Great Britain's national debt. The Crown sought sources of revenue to pay it off and attempted to impose new taxes on its colonies. These attempts were met with increasingly stiff resistance, until troops were called in to enforce the Crown's authority. These acts ultimately led to the start of the American Revolutionary War.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance attached comparatively little value to its North American possessions, apart from the highly profitable sugar-producing Antilles islands which it retained. Minister Choiseul considered that he had made a good deal at the Treaty of Paris, and Voltaire wrote that Louis XV had lost \\"a few acres of snow\\".[74] For France, however, the military defeat and the financial burden of the war weakened the monarchy and contributed to the advent of the French Revolution in 1789.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some of the Indian tribes, the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally, although other tribes were not so affected.[75] The Ohio Country was now more available to colonial settlement, due to the construction of military roads by Braddock and Forbes.[76] The Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory was not completed until 1769, and it had modest repercussions. The British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of Indian tribes who did not want to do business with them. This migration also caused a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies who were now competing for land.[77] The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave. Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine, although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance returned to North America in 1778 with the establishment of a Franco-American alliance against Great Britain in the American War of Independence. This time, France succeeded in prevailing over Great Britain in what historian Alfred A. Cave describes as \\"French revenge for Montcalm's death\\".[79]","input":"Where did the french and indian war fight?"},{"output":"an estimated 10-12 million","context":"An AR-15 style rifle is a lightweight semi-automatic rifle based on the Colt AR-15 design.

It has been used in many mass shootings in the United States.[4] The Federal Assault Weapons Ban restricted the Colt AR-15 and derivatives from 1994-2004, although it did not affect rifles with fewer features.[5][6] There are an estimated 10-12 million in circulation in the United States.[4]\\r\\nIn 1956, ArmaLite designed a lightweight assault rifle for military use and designated it the ArmaLite Rifle-15, or AR-15.[7][8][9] Due to financial problems, and limitations in terms of manpower and production capacity, ArmaLite sold the design and the AR-15 trademark to Colt's Manufacturing Company in 1959.[10] In 1964, Colt began selling its own version with an improved semi-automatic design known as the Colt AR-15.[11] After Colt's patents expired in 1977, an active marketplace emerged for other manufacturers to produce and sell their own AR-15 style rifles.[1]\\r\\nIn 2009, the term \\"modern sporting rifle\\" was coined by the National Shooting Sports Foundation for its survey that year as a marketing term used by the firearms industry to describe modular semi-automatic rifles including AR-15s.[12][13][14][15] Today, nearly every major firearm manufacturer produces its own generic AR-15 style rifle.[16][14] As Colt continues to own and use the AR-15 trademark for its line of AR-15 variants, other manufacturers must use their own model numbers and names to market their AR-15 style rifles for commercial sale.[17]\\r\\nWhile most earlier breech-loading rifles had a single receiver housing both the trigger and reloading mechanism, an innovative feature of the AR-15 was modular construction to simplify substitution of parts and avoid need for arsenal facilities for most repairs of malfunctioning military rifles.[18] A distinctive two-part receiver is used by both military and sporting AR-15 style rifles. As civilian ownership of AR-15 style rifles became sufficient to create a market for improvements, numerous manufacturers began producing one or more \\"improved\\" modules, assemblies, or parts with features not found on factory rifles; and individuals with average mechanical aptitude can often substitute these pieces for original equipment. Due to the vast assortment of aftermarket parts and accessories available, AR-15 style rifles have also been referred to as \\"the Swiss Army knife of rifles\\",[19] \\"Barbie Dolls for Guys\\"[20][21][22] or \\"LEGOs\\" for adults.[23][24][25] These more or less interchangeable modules are a defining characteristic of AR-15 style modern sporting rifles.[26]\\r\\nThe lower receiver is the serial-numbered part legally defined as the firearm under United States law. The lower receiver is visually distinguished by the trigger guard ahead of the detachable pistol grip, and behind the magazine well capable of holding detachable magazines. The lower receiver holds the trigger assembly including the hammer, and is the attachment point for the buttstock. The lower receiver is attached to the upper receiver by two removable pins. Disassembly for cleaning or repair of malfunctions often requires removal of these pins. Removal of the rear take-down pin allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a hinge.[18]\\r\\nThe upper receiver contains the bolt carrier assembly, and is attached to the barrel assembly. Sights will be attached to the upper receiver or to the barrel assembly. A handguard usually encloses the barrel and a gas-operated reloading device using burnt powder gas vented from a hole (or port) in the barrel near the forward end of the handguard. The handguard is attached to the upper receiver and may also be attached to the barrel.[18]\\r\\nThe initial design included a tube to vent burnt powder gas back into the bolt carrier assembly where it expands in a variable volume chamber forcing the bolt open to eject the spent cartridge case. A buffer spring in the buttstock then pushes the bolt closed picking up a new cartridge from the magazine. This direct gas impingement (DGI) system has the disadvantage of venting unburned smokeless powder residue into the receiver where it may ultimately accumulate in quantities causing malfunctions. A more recent alternative design has a metal operating rod pushing against the bolt carrier from a gas piston under the handguard near the barrel port. This piston keeps the receiver cleaner by exhausting under the handguard.[27] While both the DGI and piston systems produce semi-automatic fire, an alternative unported barrel assembly includes a sliding handguard connected to a rod moving the bolt by a pump action and eliminating semi-automatic fire.[28]\\r\\nMost rifles eject spent cartridges from the right side of the receiver away from right handed shooters who place the butt against the right shoulder while sighting with the right eye and using a finger of the right hand to pull the trigger.[29] Right-side ejection is a disadvantage for the third of the population whose left eye is dominant,[30] and for the tenth of the population who are left handed,[31] because holding these rifles against their left shoulder for maximum accuracy causes the rifle to eject hot spent cases toward the chest, neck or face of a left handed shooter.[32] The modular design of AR-15 style rifles has encouraged several manufacturers to offer specialized parts including leftward ejecting upper receivers for converting right handed AR-15 style rifles for left handed use.[33][34][35]\\r\\nSome AR-15-style rifles have features limiting use of detachable magazines to comply with state regulations.[36][37] A few unusual versions are incapable of semi-automatic fire.[28][38] Nearly all versions of the civilian AR-15 have a pistol grip like the military versions, and some have folding or collapsible stocks like the M4 carbine which reduce the overall length of the rifle.\\r\\nThe semi-automatic civilian AR-15 was introduced by Colt in 1963. The primary distinction between civilian semi-automatic rifles and military models is select fire. Military models were produced with firing modes, semi-automatic fire and either fully automatic fire mode or burst fire mode, in which the rifle fires three rounds in succession when the trigger is depressed. Most components are interchangeable between semi-auto and select fire rifles including magazines, sights, upper receiver, barrels and accessories.[39][40] The military M4 carbine typically uses a 14.5\\" barrel. Civilian rifles commonly have 16 inch or longer barrels to comply with the National Firearms Act.[41]\\r\\nIn order to prevent a civilian semi-automatic AR-15 from being readily converted for use with the select fire components a number of features were changed. Parts changed include the lower receiver, bolt carrier, hammer, trigger, disconnector, and safety/mode selector. The semi-automatic bolt carrier has a longer lightening slot to prevent the bolt's engagement with an automatic sear. Due to a decrease in mass the buffer spring is heavier. On the select fire version, the hammer has an extra spur which interacts with the additional auto-sear that holds it back until the bolt carrier group is fully in battery, when automatic fire is selected.[42] Using a portion of the select fire parts in a semi-automatic rifle will not enable a select fire option.[43] As designed by Colt the pins supporting the semi-auto trigger and hammer in the lower receiver are larger than those used in the military rifle to prevent interchangeability between semi-automatic and select fire components.[44]\\r\\nThe first version produced for commercial sale by Colt was the AR-15 Sporter, in .223 Remington, with a 20-inch barrel and issued with 5-round magazines.[11] Initial sales of the Colt AR-15 were slow, primarily due to its fixed sights and carry handle that made scopes difficult to mount and awkward to use.[45]\\r\\nIn the 1990s, sales of AR-15 style rifles increased dramatically, partly as a result of the introduction of the flat top upper receiver which allowed scopes and sighting devices to be easily mounted as well as new features such as free floating hand guards that increased accuracy.[45] While only a handful of companies were manufacturing these rifles in 1994, by the 21st century the number of AR-15 style rifles had more than doubled.[46] From 2000 to 2015, the number of manufacturers of AR-15 style variants and knock-offs increased from 29 to about 500.[47] Today, AR-15 style rifles are available in a wide range of configurations and calibers from a large number of manufacturers. These configurations range from standard full-sizes rifles with 20 inch barrels, to short carbine-length models with 16 inch barrels, adjustable length stocks and optical sights, to long range target models with 24 inch barrels, bipods and high-powered scopes.[48]\\r\\nEstimates vary as to how many of the rifles are owned in the United States. The National Shooting Sports Foundation has estimated that approximately 5 million to 10 million AR-15 style rifles exist in the U.S. within the broader total of the 300 million firearms owned by Americans.[49]\\r\\nSince the upper and lower receivers may be swapped between rifles, forensic firearm examination of bullets and spent cartridges may reveal distinguishing marks from the barrel and upper receiver group without identifying the lower receiver for which legal records may be available.[50] An individual may use several upper receiver groups with the same lower receiver. These upper receiver groups may have differing barrel lengths and sights, and may fire different cartridges. A hunter with a single lower receiver might have one upper receiver with a .223 Remington barrel and telescopic sight for varmint hunting in open country and another upper receiver with a .458 SOCOM barrel and iron sights for big-game hunting in brushy woodland. The dimensions of upper and lower receivers originally designed for the 5.56G45mm NATO cartridge impose an overall length limit and diameter limits when adapting modules for other cartridges included in this list of AR platform calibers.[51][48] The same magazine in the lower receiver group may hold differing numbers of different cartridges.[27]\\r\\nWhile most gun killings in the United States are with handguns,[52][53][54] AR-15 style rifles have played \\"an oversized role in many of the most high-profile\\"[52] mass shootings in the United States, and have come to be widely characterized as the weapon of choice for perpetrators of these crimes.[55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63] AR-15 variants were the primary weapon used in the most recent six of the ten deadliest mass shootings in American history,[64] including the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the 2015 San Bernardino attack,[4] the 2017 Las Vegas shooting,[65] the 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting,[65] and the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.[66]\\r\\nFollowing the use of a Colt AR-15 rifle in the Port Arthur massacre, the worst single-person shooting incident in Australian history, the country enacted the National Firearms Programme Implementation Act 1996, restricting the private ownership of semi-automatic rifles with a capacity of more than 5 rounds (Category D[67]).[68][69][70]\\r\\nREC7 by Barrett\\r\\nSR-556 by Ruger\\r\\nSIG516 by SIG Sauer\\r\\nM&P15 by Smith & Wesson","input":"How many ar 15 type rifles in america?"},{"output":"1 square hectometre (hm2)","context":"The hectare (/?h?kt??r, -t?r/; SI symbol: ha) is an SI accepted metric system unit of area equal to 100 ares (10,000?m2) or 1 square hectometre (hm2) and primarily used in the measurement of land as a metric replacement for the imperial acre.[1] An acre is about 0.405 hectare and one hectare contains about 2.47 acres.\\r\\nIn 1795, when the metric system was introduced, the \\"are\\" was defined as 100 square metres and the hectare (\\"hecto-\\" + \\"are\\") was thus 100 \\"ares\\" or ?1?100?km2. When the metric system was further rationalised in 1960, resulting in the International System of Units (SI), the are was not included as a recognised unit. The hectare, however, remains as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI units, mentioned in Section 4.1 of the SI Brochure as a unit whose use is \\"expected to continue indefinitely\\".[1] \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe metric system of measurement was first given a legal basis in 1795 by the French Revolutionary government. The law of 18 Germinal, Year III (7 April 1795) defined five units of measure:[2]\\r\\nAlthough the law defined the length of the metre, there was no practical way of accurately measuring the metre (and hence the are) until 1799 when the first standard metre was manufactured and adopted.\\r\\nThe standard metre remained in the custody of successive French governments until 1875 when, under the Convention of the Metre, its supervision passed into international control under the auspices of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM). At the first meeting of the CGPM in 1889 when a new standard metre, manufactured by Johnson Matthey & Co of London[4] was adopted, the are and hectare were automatically redefined.\\r\\nIn 1960, when the metric system was updated as the International System of Units (SI), the are did not receive international recognition. The International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) makes no mention of the are in the current (2006) definition of the SI, but classifies the hectare as a \\"Non-SI unit accepted for use with the International System of Units\\"[5]\\r\\nIn 1972, the European Economic Community (EEC) passed directive 71/354/EEC,[6] which catalogued the units of measure that might be used within the Community. The units that were catalogued replicated the recommendations of the CGPM, supplemented by a few other units including the are (and implicitly the hectare) whose use was limited to the measurement of land.\\r\\nMany UK farmers, especially older ones, still use the acre for everyday calculations, and convert to hectares only for official (especially European Union) paperwork. Farm fields can have very long histories which are resistant to change, with names such as \\"the six acre field\\" stretching back hundreds of years and across generations of family farmers. Some younger agricultural workers are now beginning to think in hectares as their \\"first language\\", though this is more typical of professional consultants and managers than of traditional farming and land-owning families, and in some circles may be viewed as a social class indicator.\\r\\nThe names centiare, deciare, decare and hectare are derived by adding the standard metric prefixes to the original base unit of area, the are.\\r\\nThe centiare is one square metre.\\r\\nThe deciare is ten square metres.\\r\\nThe are (/?r/[7] or /??r/[8]) is a unit of area, equal to 100 square metres (10 m G 10 m), used for measuring land area. It was defined by older forms of the metric system, but is now outside the modern International System of Units (SI).[9] It is still commonly used in colloquial speech to measure real estate, in particular in Indonesia, India, and in various European countries.\\r\\nIn Russian and other languages of the former Soviet Union, the are is called sotka (Russian: ҿ: 'a hundred', i.e. 100?m2). It is used to describe the size of suburban dacha or allotment garden plots or small city parks where the hectare would be too large.\\r\\nEtymologically, the word are finds its roots in the Talmudic Aramaic word ???? (araa), meaning \\"land\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nThe decare (/?d?k?r, -??r/) is derived from deca and are, and is equal to 10 ares or 1000 square metres. It is used in Norway[10] and in the former Ottoman areas of the Middle East and the Balkans (Bulgaria)[11] as a measure of land area. Instead of the name \\"decare\\", the names of traditional land measures are usually used, redefined as one decare:\\r\\nThe hectare (/?h?kt??r, -t?r/[15]), although not a unit of SI, is the only named unit of area that is accepted for use within the SI.[16] In practice the hectare is fully derived from the SI, being equivalent to a square hectometre. It is widely used throughout the world for the measurement of large areas of land, and it is the legal unit of measure in domains concerned with land ownership, planning, and management, including law (land deeds), agriculture, forestry, and town planning throughout the European Union.[17] The United Kingdom,[18] United States, Burma,[19][20] and to some extent Canada use the acre instead.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome countries that underwent a general conversion from traditional measurements to metric measurements (e.g. Canada) required a resurvey when units of measure in legal descriptions relating to land were converted to metric units.[citation needed] Others, such as South Africa, published conversion factors which were to be used particularly \\"when preparing consolidation diagrams by compilation\\".[21]\\r\\nIn many countries, metrication redefined or clarified existing measures in terms of metric units.

It was announced on the March 22, 1993 episode of Monday Night Raw where Andr the Giant, who had died nearly two months prior, was announced as the sole inductee.[1][2][3] The 1994 and 1995 ceremonies were held in conjunction with the annual King of the Ring pay-per-view events. In 1996, the ceremony was held with the Survivor Series event, for the first time in front of a paying audience as well as the wrestlers, after which, the Hall of Fame went on hiatus.\\r\\nIn 2004, WWE relaunched the Hall of Fame to coincide with WrestleMania XX.[4] This ceremony, like its predecessors, was not broadcast on television. However, it was released on DVD on June 1, 2004.[5] Beginning with the 2005 ceremony, an edited version of the Hall of Fame was broadcast on Spike TV (2005)[6] and on the USA Network (2006[7]ÿpresent[8]); these were aired on tape delay.

Together with Jordanian Arabic, it has the ISO 639-3 language code \\"ajp\\", known as South Levantine Arabic. Further dialects can be distinguished within Palestine, such as spoken in the northern West Bank, that spoken in the Gaza Strip (and by Negev Bedouins in Israel), and that spoken by Palestinians in the Hebron area, which is similar to Jordan and south-western Syria.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dialects spoken by the Arabs of the Levant ÿ the Eastern shore of the Mediterranean ÿ or Levantine Arabic, form a group of dialects of Arabic. Arabic manuals for the \\"Syrian dialect\\" were produced in the early 20th century,[3] and in 1909 a specific \\"Palestinean Arabic\\" manual was published.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Palestinian Arabic dialects are varieties of Levantine Arabic because they display the following characteristic Levantine features.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noticeable differences between southern and northern forms of Levantine Arabic, such as Syrian Arabic and Lebanese Arabic, are stronger in non-urban dialects. The main differences between Palestinian and northern Levantine Arabic are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also typical Palestinian words that are shibboleths in the Levant. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs is very common in Arabic-speaking countries, the dialect spoken by a person depends on both the region he/she comes from, and the social group he/she belongs to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Urban ('madani') dialects resemble closely northern Levantine Arabic dialects, that is, the colloquial variants of western Syria and Lebanon.[4] This fact, that makes the urban dialects of the Levant remarkably homogeneous, is probably due to the trading network among cities in the Ottoman Levant, or to an older Arabic dialect layer closer to the qeltu dialects still spoken in northern Iraq/Syria and Southern Turkey. Nablus takes a special place. The Nablus dialect distributed accents on the various syllables of the word. Almost each syllable has a stressed accent, which gives the dialect a slow and sluggish tone. The ancient dialect of Nablus even articulates every single syllable in the same word separately. Moreover, word endings blatantly slant according to a regulated system. For example, you may say sharqa with an [a:] sound at the end of the word to refer to the eastern part of the city and gharbeh with the [e] sound at the end of the word to refer to the western side of the city. You may also want to describe the colour of your bag and say safra (yellow) with an [a:] sound at the end of the word or sode (black) with an [e] sound at the end of the word. The nun and ha (n and h) are always slanted and end with the [e] sound; and they are the bases for the distinctive Nablusi accent. The two letters appear frequently at the end of words in the form of inescapable objective pronouns. In the ancient dialect of Nablus, the letters tha, thal, thaa, and qaf do not exist. The dialect of old Nablus is now to be found among the Samaritans, who have managed to preserve the old dialect in its purest form.\\r\\n\\r\\nUrban dialects are characterised by the [?] (hamza) pronunciation of ? qaf, the simplification of interdentals as dentals plosives, i.e.  ? as [t], ? as [d] and both  ? and  ? as [d?]. Note however that in borrowings from Modern Standard Arabic, these interdental consonants are realised as dental sibilants, i.e.  ? as [s], ? as [d] and both  ? and  ? as [z?]. The Druzes have a dialect that may be classified with the Urban ones, with the difference that they keep the uvular pronunciation of ? qaf as [q]. The urban dialects also ignore the difference between masculine and feminine in the plural pronouns ???? ['?ntu] is both 'you' (masc. plur.) and 'you' (fem. plur.), and  ['h?mme] is both 'they' (masc.) and 'they' (fem.)\\r\\n\\r\\nRural or farmer ('fallahi') variety is retaining the interdental consonants, and is closely related with rural dialects in the outer southern Levant and in Lebanon. They keep the distinction between masculine and feminine plural pronouns, e.g. ???? ['?ntu] is 'you' (masc.) while ???? ['?nt?n] is 'you' (fem.), and ??? ['h?mme] is 'they' (masc.) while ??? ['h?nne] is 'they' (fem.).  The three rural groups in the region are the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bedouins of Southern Levant use two different ('badawi') dialects in Galilee and the Negev. The Negev desert Bedouins, who are also present in Palestine and Gaza Strip use a dialect closely related to those spoken in the Hijaz, and in the Sinai. Unlike them, the Bedouins of Galilee speak a dialect related to those of the Syrian Desert and Najd, which indicates their arrival to the region is relatively recent. The Palestinian resident Negev Bedouins, who are present around Hebron and Jerusalem have a specific vocabulary, they maintain the interdental consonants, they do not use the ?-[-?] negative suffix, they always realise ? /k/ as [k] and ? /q/ as [g], and distinguish plural masculine from plural feminine pronouns, but with different forms as the rural speakers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the urban dialects side, the current trend is to have urban dialects getting closer to their rural neighbours, thus introducing some variability among cities in the Levant. For instance, Jerusalem used to say as Damascus ['n??na] (\\"we\\") and ['h?nne] (\\"they\\") at the beginning of the 20th century, and this has moved to the more rural ['??na] and ['h?mme] nowadays.[5] This trend was probably initiated by the partition of the Levant of several states in the course of the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rural description given above is moving nowadays with two opposite trends. On the one hand, urbanisation gives a strong influence power to urban dialects. As a result, villagers may adopt them at least in part, and Beduin maintain a two-dialect practice. On the other hand, the individualisation that comes with urbanisation make  people feel more free to choose the way they speak than before, and in the same way as some will use typical Egyptian features as [le:] for [le:?], others may use typical rural features such as the rural realisation [k?] of ? as a pride reaction against the stigmatisation of this pronunciation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Palestinian Arabic is spoken in the heartland of the Semitic languages, it has kept many typical semitic words. For this reason, it is relatively easy to guess how Modern Standard Arabic words map onto Palestinian Arabic Words. The  list (Swadesh list) of basic word of Palestinian Arabic  available on the Wiktionary (see external links below) may be used for this. However, some words are not transparent mappings from MSA, and deserve a description. This is due either to meaning changes in Arabic along the centuries - while MSA keeps the Classical Arabic meanings - or to the adoption of non-Arabic words (see below). Note that this section focuses on Urban Palestinian unless otherwise specified.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepositional pseudo verbs\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words used in Palestinian to express the basic verbs 'to want', 'to have', 'there is/are' are called prepositional pseudo verbs because they share all the features of verbs but are constructed with a preposition and a suffix pronoun.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the perfect, they are preceded by ??? [ka:n], e.g. we wanted is ??? ???? [ka:n 'b?ddna].\\r\\n\\r\\nRelative clause\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in most forms of colloquial Arabic, the relative clause markers of Classical Arabic (?????  ????? ??????? ??????? ????? and ??????) have been simplified to a single form ???? ['??lli].\\r\\n\\r\\nInterrogatives pronouns\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main Palestinian interrogative pronouns (with their Modern Standard Arabic counterparts) are the following ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that it is tempting to consider the long [i:] in ??? [mi:n] 'who?' as an influence of ancient Hebrew ?? [mi:] on Classical Arabic ?? [man], but it could be as well an analogy with the long vowels of the other interrogatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarking Indirect Object\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Classical Arabic, the indirect object was marked with the particle /li-/ ('for', 'to'). For instance 'I said to him' was ??? ?? ['qultu 'lahu] and 'I wrote to her' was ???? ??? [ka'tabtu la'ha:]. In Palestinian Arabic, the Indirect Object marker is still based on the consonant /l/, but with more complex rules, and two different vocal patterns. The basic form before pronouns is a clitic [?ll-], that always bears the stress, and to which person pronouns are suffixed. The basic form before nouns is [la]. For instance\\r\\n\\r\\nBorrowings\\r\\n\\r\\nPalestinians have borrowed words from the many languages they have been in contact with throughout history. For example,\\r\\n\\r\\nPalestinians in the Palestinian territories sometimes refer to their brethren in Israel as \\"the b'seder Arabs\\" because of their adoption of the Hebrew word ???????? [beseder] for 'O.K.', (while Arabic is ????[ma:?i]). However words like  ramzor ????????? 'traffic light' and ma?som ????????? 'roadblock' have become a part of the general Palestinian vernacular.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2009 film Ajami is mostly spoken in Palestinian-Hebrew Arabic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most often cited example of vowel harmony in Palestinian Arabic is in the present tense conjugations of verbs. If the root vowel is rounded, then the roundness spreads to other high vowels in the prefix. Vowel harmony in PA is also found in the nominal verbal domain. Suffixes are immune to rounding harmony, and vowels left of the stressed syllable do not have vowel harmony.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nPalestinian Arabic has a regressive vowel harmony for these present tense conjugations: if the verb stems main vowel is /u/, then the vowel in the prefix is also /u/, else the vowel is /i/. This is compared with standard Arabic (which can be seen as representative of other Arabic dialects), where the vowel in the prefix is constantly /a/.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe variations between dialects probably reflect the different historical steps of Arabization of Palestine.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to their adoption of the Arabic language in the seventh century, the inhabitants of Palestine predominantly spoke Palestinian Aramaic (as witnessed, for example, in Palestinian Jewish and Palestinian Christian literature), as well as Greek (probably in the upper or trader social classes), and some remaining traces of Hebrew. At that time in history, Arabic-speaking people living in the Negev desert or in the Jordan desert beyond Zarqa, Amman or Karak had no significant influence. On the contrary, they tended to adopt Aramaic as a written language as shown in the Nabataean language texts of Petra or the Palmyrene dialect documents of Tadmur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adoption of Arabic among the local population occurred most probably in several waves. After the Arabs took control of the area, so as to maintain their regular activity, the upper classes had quickly to get fluency in the language of the new masters who most probably were only few. The prevalence of Northern Levantine features in the urban dialects until the early 20th century, as well as in the dialect of Samaritans in Nablus (with systematic imala of /a:/) tends to show that a first layer of Arabization of urban upper classes could have led to what is now urban Levantine. Then, the main phenomenon could have been the slow countryside shift of Aramaic-speaking villages to Arabic under the influence of Arabized elites, leading to the emergence of the rural Palestinian dialects[citation needed]. This scenario is consistent with several facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1940 the Gospel of Mark was published in Palestinian Arabic in Arabic script.[8] In 1946 the Gospel of Matthew and the Letter of James were also published in Palestinian Arabic.[9]","input":"What type of arabic is spoken in palestine?"},{"output":"after September 15, 2009","context":"In US accounting practices, the Accounting Standards Codification is the current single source of United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

(plural cloacae /klo??e?si/ kloh-AY-see or /klo??e?ki/ kloh-AY-kee) is the posterior orifice that serves as the only opening for the digestive, reproductive, and urinary tracts (if present) of certain animals, opening at the vent. All amphibians, birds, reptiles, and a few mammals (monotremes, tenrecs, golden moles, and marsupial moles) have this orifice, from which they excrete both urine and feces; this is in contrast to most placental mammals, which have two or three separate orifices for evacuation. Excretory systems with analogous purpose in certain invertebrates are also sometimes referred to as cloacae.\\r\\nThe cloacal region is also often associated with a secretory organ, the cloacal gland, which has been implicated in the scent-marking behavior of some reptiles, amphibians, and monotremes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word is from the Latin verb cluo, \\"to cleanse\\", thus the noun cloaca, \\"sewer, drain\\".[1]\\r\\nBirds reproduce using their cloaca; this occurs during a cloacal kiss in most birds. Birds that mate using this method touch their cloacae together, in some species for only a few seconds, sufficient time for sperm to be transferred from the male to the female.[2] The reproductive system must be re-engorged before the mating season of each species. Such regeneration usually takes about a month. Birds generally produce one batch of eggs per year, but they will produce another if the first is taken away. For some birds, such as ostriches, cassowaries, kiwi, geese, and some species of swans and ducks, the males do not use the cloaca for reproduction, but have a phallus. In those, the penis helps ensure water does not wash away the male's sperm during copulation.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne study[3] has looked into birds that use their cloaca for cooling.[4]\\r\\nAmong fish, a true cloaca is present only in elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) and lobe-finned fishes. In lampreys and in some ray-finned fishes, part of the cloaca remains in the adult to receive the urinary and reproductive ducts, although the anus always opens separately. In chimaeras and most teleosts, however, all three openings are entirely separated.[5]\\r\\nWith a few exceptions noted below, mammals have no cloacae. Even in those that have one, the cloaca is partially subdivided into separate regions for the anus and urethra.\\r\\nThe monotremes (egg-laying mammals) possess a true cloaca.[6]\\r\\nIn marsupials (and a few birds), the genital tract is separate from the anus, but a trace of the original cloaca does remain externally.[5] This is one of the features of marsupials (and monotremes) that suggest their basal nature, as the amniotes from which mammals evolved possessed a cloaca, and the earliest animals to diverge into the mammalian class would most likely have had this feature, too.\\r\\nUnlike other marsupials, marsupial moles have a true cloaca,[7] a fact that has been argued against a marsupial identity for these mammals.[8][9]\\r\\nMost adult placental mammals have no remaining trace of the cloaca. In the embryo, the embryonic cloaca divides into a posterior region that becomes part of the anus, and an anterior region that has different fates depending on the sex of the individual: in females, it develops into the vestibule that receives the urethra and vagina, while in males it forms the entirety of the penile urethra.[5] However, the tenrecs and golden moles, small placental mammals native to Africa, as well as some shrews retain a cloaca as adults.[10]\\r\\nBeing placental animals, humans only have an embryonic cloaca, which is split up into separate tracts during the development of the urinary and reproductive organs. However, a few human congenital disorders result in persons being born with a cloaca, including persistent cloaca and sirenomelia (mermaid syndrome).\\r\\nIn reptiles, the cloaca consists of the urodeum, proctodeum, and coprodeum.[11][12] Some species have modified cloacae for increased gas exchange (see Reptile respiration and Reptile reproduction). This is where reproductive activity occurs.[13] In Gila monsters, Heloderma suspectum, the cloaca can be inflated to cool the body through the process of cloacal evaporation. [14]\\r\\nSome turtles, especially those specialized in diving, are highly reliant on cloacal respiration during dives.[15] They accomplish this by having a pair of accessory air bladders connected to the cloaca which can absorb oxygen from the water.[16] Various fish, as well as polychaete worms and even crabs, are specialized to take advantage of the constant flow of water through the cloacal respiratory tree of sea cucumbers while simultaneously gaining the protection of living within the sea cucumber itself.

In 1943, Piaf had performed at a nightclub/bordello called \\"La Vie en Rose\\".[8] Initially, Piaf's peers and songwriting team did not think the song would be successful, finding it weaker than the rest of her repertoire. Heeding their advice, the singer put the song aside, only to change her mind the next year. The song was performed live in concert for the first time in 1946. It became a favorite with audiences.[7] \\"La Vie en rose\\" was the song that made Piaf internationally famous, with its lyrics telling about the joy of finding true love and appealing to those who had survived the difficult wartime.[9]\\r\\n\\"La Vie en rose\\" was released on a 10\\" single in 1947 by Columbia Records, a division of EMI, with \\"Un refrain courait dans la rue\\" making the B-side. It met with a warm reception and sold a million copies in the US.[10] It was the biggest-selling single of 1948 in Italy, and the ninth biggest-selling single in Brazil in 1949.[11] Piaf performed the song in the 1948 French movie Neuf gar?ons, un c?ur. The first of her albums to include \\"La Vie en rose\\" was the 10\\" Chansons parisiennes, released in 1950. The song appeared on most of Piaf's subsequent albums, and on numerous greatest hits compilations. It went on to become her signature song and her trademark hit, sitting with \\"Milord\\" and \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" among her best-known and most recognizable tunes. Encouraged by its success, Piaf wrote 80 more songs in her career.[7]\\r\\nEnglish lyrics were written by Mack David and numerous versions were recorded in the US in 1950. Those that charted were by Tony Martin (reached the No. 9 position in the Billboard charts), Paul Weston (No. 12 position), Bing Crosby (No. 13 position), Edith Piaf (No. 23 position), Ralph Flanagan (No. 27 position) and Victor Young (No. 27 position). Louis Armstrong recorded C'est si bon and La Vie en rose in New York City with Sy Oliver and his Orchestra on June 26, 1950[12] and this reached the No. 28 position in the Billboard charts.[13] Bing Crosby also recorded the song in French in 1953 for his album Le Bing: Song Hits of Paris.\\r\\nThe song received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998.[14]\\r\\nTwo films about Piaf named after the song's title have been produced. The first one, a 1998 documentary, used archive footage and interviews with Raquel Bitton, and was narrated by Bebe Neuwirth. The 2007 biographical feature film La Vie en Rose won Marion Cotillard an Academy Award for Best Actress for portraying Piaf in the film from childhood until her death at 47.[15]\\r\\nJamaican singer Grace Jones covered \\"La Vie en rose\\" in 1977 for her debut studio album Portfolio. It was the third and the last single off that album, and at the same time, her first single release on Island Records after having signed with the label.\\r\\nThe single version was heavily edited from its original album version being more than seven minutes long to a 3.5-minute track. Jones' fairly radical bossa nova interpretation of dith Piaf's signature tune became her first international hit single and a staple of her repertoire. It was later performed as part of her 1981 A One Man Show, then the only track from her disco era to be included in the show. In Spain and Mexico the track was billed as \\"La Vida en rosa\\" on the 7\\" single release, although it was not a Spanish version of the song. Jones' recording of \\"La Vie en rose\\" was later re-released a number of times in the early 1980s and finally reached #12 in the UK charts when re-released as a double A-side with \\"Pull Up to the Bumper\\" in 1985. The single was certified Gold in France and Italy.[18]\\r\\nGrace Jones about the song: \\"That's a very special song to me. Oh God, I cry every time I sing it. I had quite a few French lovers, so every time I sing it I think about them.\\"[19]\\r\\nIt has sold 158,700 copies in France. [20]\\r\\nThe music video for the song was made using the chroma key technique. It presents Grace dancing and singing the song with the famous 1978 montage picture of herself in the background, which was later used for the cover of her 1985 Island Life compilation. The video begins with Grace wearing a rose-patterned coat. Having removed it, the singer dances in a scant gold dress which reveals her right nipple as well as black underwear.\\r\\nAmerican singer Donna Summer covered \\"La Vie en rose\\" in 1993 for the tribute album called Tribute to Edith Piaf or Edith Piaf Tribute, on which several contemporary stars recorded interpretations of some of Piaf's best known songs. Released on both vinyl and CD, the American release of the album and single contain a different mix of Summer's synth-driven performance than the French release. These releases are among the most sought after of Summer's collectables.[citation needed] The U.S. single features a variety of remixes by DJ Chris Cox.","input":"When did louis armstrong record la vie en rose?"},{"output":"Constitutional Convention","context":"","input":"What was the first form of government of the u.s. after the revolutionary war?"},{"output":"approximately 90 miles (140 km) southeast","context":"The Charleston Bump is a deepwater rocky ocean bottom feature approximately 90 miles (140 km) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.

The film's title refers simultaneously to the city of Los Angeles and to the idiom for being out of touch with reality.\\r\\nChazelle wrote the screenplay in 2010 but did not find a studio willing to finance the production without changes to his design. Following the success of his 2014 film Whiplash, the project was picked up by Summit Entertainment. Filming took place from August to September 2015 in Los Angeles. La La Land premiered at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 9, 2016. It grossed $446 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million.\\r\\nLa La Land received positive reviews, being praised for Chazelle's screenplay and direction, Gosling and Stone's performances, Justin Hurwitz's musical score, and the film's musical numbers. It won in every category for which it was nominated at the 74th Golden Globe Awards, with a record-breaking seven wins, and received 11 nominations at the 70th British Academy Film Awards, winning five. It received 14 nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, tying the record for the most Oscar nominations with All About Eve (1950) and Titanic (1997). It ended up winning six: Best Director, Best Actress (Stone), Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Original Song (\\"City of Stars\\"), and Best Production Design.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile stuck in traffic on a Los Angeles highway, Mia Dolan, an aspiring actress, has a moment of road rage with Sebastian Wilder, a struggling jazz pianist. After a bad day at work, her subsequent audition goes poorly when the casting director takes a call in the middle of an emotional scene. That night, Mia's roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills, where Mia hopes for a breakthrough. She walks home after her car is towed.\\r\\nDuring a musical gig at a restaurant, Sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation despite warnings from the owner to stick to the set in stone list of traditional Christmas songs. Mia overhears the music as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant, but Sebastian is fired for his disobedience. As he storms out, Mia attempts to compliment him, but he brushes her off.\\r\\nMonths later, Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band; she teases him by requesting a song he considers an insult for \\"a serious musician\\". After the gig, the two walk to their cars, lamenting each other's company despite the chemistry between them.\\r\\nThe next day, Sebastian arrives at Mia's work, and she shows Sebastian around the movie studio backlot, where she works as a barista, while explaining her passion for acting. Sebastian takes Mia to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and desire to open his own club. They warm up to each other. Sebastian invites Mia to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause; Mia accepts, forgetting a commitment with her current boyfriend. Bored with the double date with her boyfriend, she runs to the theater and finds Sebastian as the film begins. When the projector breaks, the two conclude their evening with a romantic dance at the Griffith Observatory.\\r\\nAfter more failed auditions, Mia decides, at Sebastian's suggestion, to write a one-woman play. Sebastian begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and the two move in together. Sebastian's former classmate Keith invites him to be the keyboardist in his jazz fusion band, where he will be offered a steady income. Although he is dismayed by the band's pop style, Sebastian signs after overhearing Mia trying to convince her mother that Sebastian is working on his career. The band finds success, but when Mia attends one of their concerts she is disturbed, knowing Sebastian does not enjoy their music.\\r\\nDuring the band's first tour, Mia and Sebastian get into an argument; she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while Sebastian claims she liked him more when he was unsuccessful. Mia leaves, insulted and frustrated. Sebastian misses Mia's play due to a band photo shoot that he had previously forgotten. The play is a disaster; few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments. Sebastian attempts to apologize to Mia for missing the play, but she is unwilling to forgive him and ends their relationship. Despondent and unable to pay the theater back, Mia moves back home to Boulder City, Nevada.\\r\\nSebastian receives a call from a casting director who attended Mia's play, inviting her to a film audition. Sebastian drives to Boulder City and persuades Mia to attend. The casting directors ask Mia to tell a story; she sings an ode to her aunt who inspired her to pursue acting. Sebastian, confident the audition was a success, encourages Mia to devote herself to the opportunity. The two profess they will always love each other but are uncertain of their future.\\r\\nFive years later, Mia is a famous actress and happily married to another man, with whom she has a daughter. One night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Noticing the \\"Seb's\\" logo she had once designed, Mia realizes Sebastian has opened his club. When Sebastian notices Mia in the crowd, he plays their love theme on the piano, and the two imagine what might have been had their relationship worked perfectly. Before Mia leaves with her husband, she shares a poignant smile with Sebastian.\\r\\nAs a drummer, Damien Chazelle has a predilection for musical films.[7] He wrote the screenplay for La La Land in 2010, when the film industry seemed out of reach for him.[8] His idea was \\"to take the old musical but ground it in real life where things don't always exactly work out,\\"[7] and to salute creative people who move to Los Angeles to chase their dreams.[9] He conceived the film when he was a student at Harvard University with his classmate, Justin Hurwitz. The two explored the concept in their senior thesis through a low-budget musical about a Boston jazz musician, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench.[10][11] Chazelle was moved by the tradition of 1920s city symphony films, such as Manhattan (1921) and Man With a Movie Camera (1929), that paid tribute to cities.[12] After graduating, both moved to Los Angeles in 2010 and continued writing the script, but made a few modifications, such as altering the location to Los Angeles instead of Boston.[10]\\r\\nL.A., even more so than any other American city, obscures, sometimes neglects, its own history. But that can also be its own magical thing, because it's a city that reveals itself bit by bit, like an onion, if you take the time to explore it.[12]\\r\\nRather than trying to match L.A. to the charms of Paris or San Francisco, he focused on the qualities that make the city distinctive: the traffic, the sprawl, and the skylines.[12] The style and tone of the film were inspired by Jacques Demy's The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort, especially the latter, which was more dance and jazz-oriented.[13] The film also makes visual allusions to Hollywood classics such as Broadway Melody of 1940, Singin' in the Rain, The Band Wagon and An American in Paris.[14] About An American in Paris, Chazelle commented: Thats a movie that we just pillaged. Its an awesome example of how daring some of those old musicals really were.\\" [15] It shares some character development and themes with Chazelle's previous musical work, Whiplash; Chazelle said:\\r\\nHe said that both films reflect his own experiences as a filmmaker working his way up the Hollywood ladder.[9] La La Land in particular is inspired by his experience of moving from the East Coast with preconceived notions of what L.A. would be like, \\"that it was all just strip malls and freeways.\\"[12]\\r\\nChazelle was unable to produce the film for years as no studio was willing to finance an original contemporary musical, with no familiar songs. It was also a jazz musical, which The Hollywood Reporter called an \\"extinct genre\\". He believed that since he and Hurwitz were unknown at that time, it might have made financiers dubious about the project's potential.[17][10] Chazelle found producers through friends who introduced him to Fred Berger and Jordan Horowitz. With the two producers on board, the script went to Focus Features at a budget of around $1 million. The studio demanded alterations: the male lead was asked to be changed from a jazz pianist to a rock musician, the complicated opening number had to be altered, and the story's bittersweet ending needed to be dropped. Chazelle scrapped the project and moved on.[10]\\r\\nChazelle later wrote Whiplash, which was an easier concept to sell and a less risky investment.[18] After Whiplash was well received by critics upon its premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival in January, Chazelle continued his efforts to bring La La Land to the big screen.[10] A year later, when Whiplash earned five Oscar nominations at the 87th Academy Awards including Best Picture, and grossed nearly $50 million worldwide off a $3.3 million production budget, Chazelle and his project began to attract attention from studios.[17]\\r\\nFive years after Chazelle wrote the script,[19] Summit Entertainment and Black Label Media, along with producer Marc Platt, agreed to invest in La La Land and distribute it. They had been impressed by the critical and commercial success of Whiplash.[9] Lionsgate's Patrick Wachsberger, who had previously worked on the Step Up franchise, pushed Chazelle to increase the film's budget since he felt high-quality musicals could not be made cheaply.[20]\\r\\nInitially, Miles Teller and Emma Watson were both set to star in the leads. Watson dropped out over a commitment to the 2017 musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, while Teller departed via long contract negotiations.[8] Conversely, Gosling himself turned down a role as the Beast in Beauty and the Beast in favor of La La Land.[21] Chazelle decided to make his characters somewhat older, with experience in struggling to make their dreams, rather than younger newcomers just arriving in Los Angeles.[10]\\r\\nEmma Stone plays Mia, a struggling actress in Los Angeles.[17] Stone has loved musicals since she saw Les Misrables when she was 8 years old, saying that \\"bursting into song has always been a real dream of mine\\", and that her favorite film is the 1931 Charlie Chaplin romantic comedy City Lights.[17][7] She studied pom dancing as a child, with a year of ballet.[17] She moved to Hollywood with her mother at the age of 15 to pursue a career, and struggled constantly to get an audition during her first year. When she did, she was often turned away after singing or saying just one line.[22] Stone drew from her own experiences for her character of Mia, and some were added into the film.[16]\\r\\nShe met Chazelle in 2014 while she was making her Broadway debut in Cabaret. Chazelle and Hurwitz saw her perform on a night when the actress had a cold.[17][23] She met with Chazelle at Brooklyn Diner in New York City, where the director outlined his vision for the planned film.[24] Stone gained confidence from performing in Cabaret to handle the demands of the film.[24] In preparation for her role, Stone watched some of the musical movies that inspired Chazelle, including The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers collaborations.[19] Stone accepted the offer because Chazelle was so passionate about the project.[24]\\r\\nRyan Gosling plays Sebastian, a jazz pianist.[17] Like Stone, Gosling drew from his own experiences as an aspiring artist. One incident was used for Mia. Gosling was performing a crying scene in an audition and the casting director took a phone call during it, talking about her lunch plans while he was emoting.[17][22][25] Chazelle met with Gosling at a bar near the latter's home in Hollywood Hills, when Gosling was about to begin filming for The Big Short.[10]\\r\\nChazelle cast the two immediately after Summit bought the film.[9] He said the two \\"feel like the closest thing that we have right now to an old Hollywood couple\\" as akin to Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and Myrna Loy and William Powell.[16] The film marked the third collaboration between Gosling and Stone, following Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and Gangster Squad (2013).[26] Chazelle asked the two about their audition disasters when they were both trying to make it.[22] Both learned how to sing and dance for the film's six original tunes.[10]\\r\\nThe rest of the cast?ÿ J. K. Simmons, Sonoya Mizuno, Jessica Rothe, Callie Hernandez, Finn Wittrock, Rosemarie DeWitt, John Legend, Jason Fuchs, Meagen Fay?ÿ were announced between July and August 2015.[27][28][29][30][31][32] Legend plays Keith, a long-time friend of Sebastian.[17]\\r\\nThe film was choreographed by Mandy Moore. Rehearsals took place at a production office in Atwater Village, Los Angeles over the span of three to four months, beginning in May 2015. Gosling practiced piano in one room, Stone worked with Moore in another, and costume designer Mary Zophres had her own corner of the complex.[17][10] Gosling, with no previous experience, had to learn how to play the piano, as no hand models were used.[33] Moore emphasised working on emotion rather than technique, which Stone said was key when they filmed the Prius car scene.[17] To help his cast and crew get their creative mode flowing, Chazelle held screenings on the soundstages every Friday night of classical films that had inspired him for the film, including The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, Singin' in the Rain, Top Hat, and Boogie Nights.[10]\\r\\nFrom the beginning, Chazelle wanted the film's musical numbers to be filmed \\"head to toe\\" and performed in a single take, like those of the 1930s works of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.[24] He also wanted the film to emulate the widescreen, CinemaScope look of 1950s musicals such as It's Always Fair Weather. Consequently, the movie was shot on celluloid film (not digitally) with Panavision equipment in a widescreen format, but not true CinemaScope as that technology is no longer available.[34][35][36][37]\\r\\nChazelle wanted Los Angeles to be the primary setting for his film, commenting that \\"there is something very poetic about the city I think, about a city that is built by people with these unrealistic dreams and people who kind of just put it all on the line for that.\\"[7] Principal photography on the film officially began in the city on August 10, 2015,[38] and filming took place in more than 60 locations both in and near Los Angeles, including the Angels Flight trolley in downtown, houses in the Hollywood Hills, the Colorado Street Bridge, the Rialto Theatre in South Pasadena, the Warner Bros. studio lot, the Grand Central Market, Hermosa Beach's Lighthouse Cafe, Chateau Marmont Hotel, and the Watts Towers, with many scenes shot in one take. It took 40 days to complete shooting, finishing in mid-September 2015.[10][39][40]\\r\\nThe opening pre-credits sequence was the first to be shot,[10] and was filmed on a closed-off portion of two carpool direct connector ramps of the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange, connecting the I-105 Carpool Lane to the I-110 Express Lanes, leading to Downtown Los Angeles. It was filmed in a span of two days, and required over 100 dancers.[9][41] For this particular scene, Chazelle wanted to give a sense of how vast the city is.[12] The scene was originally planned for a stretch of ground-level highway, until Chazelle decided to shoot it in the 105ÿ110 interchange, which arcs 100 feet (30?m) in the air. Production designer David Wasco said, \\"I thought somebody was going to fall off and get killed.\\" Not every portion of the highway was blocked.[10] Chazelle compared the scene to the yellow brick road leading to the Emerald City in The Wizard of Oz (1939).[10]\\r\\nChazelle scouted for \\"old L.A.\\" locations that were in ruins, or were perhaps razed. One such example was the use of the Angels Flight trolley, built in 1901. The funicular had been closed in 2013 after a derailment. Attempts were made to repair and re-open the railway, but to no avail. However, the production team was able to secure permission to use it for a day. Chazelle and his crew then arranged to have it run for shooting (it was re-opened to the public in 2017).[12] Mia works at a coffee shop on the Warner Bros. studio lot; Chazelle considered studio lots to be \\"monuments\\" of Hollywood. Production designer Wasco created numerous fake old film posters. Chazelle occasionally created names for them, deciding to use the title of his first feature, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench (2009) for one poster, which reimagines it as a 1930s musical.[12]\\r\\nThe six-minute-long Prius car scene had to be completed during the brief \\"magic hour\\" moment at sunset. It took eight takes and two days to shoot it.[17] When Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone finally nailed it, \\"everybody just exploded,\\" Stone said.[24] Since Gosling and Stone were not primarily dancers, the two made a number of mistakes, especially during long uninterrupted single-take musical numbers. However, Chazelle was very sympathetic towards them, understanding their lack of experience and not minding their errors.[19] While shooting Sebastian and Mia's first dance together, Stone stumbled over the back of a bench, but picked right up and kept on going with the scene.[19]\\r\\nThe fight scene during the romantic dinner that Gosling's character Sebastian prepared for Mia (Emma Stone) was one of the scenes that was re-written more than any other. Gosling and Stone also helped create the dialogue of the scene to get it to be one of the more realistic scenes in a film filled with fantasy and fantastical elements.[42]\\r\\nChazelle spent nearly a year editing the film with editor Tom Cross, as the two were primarily concerned with getting the tone just right.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe songs and score for La La Land were composed and orchestrated by Justin Hurwitz, Chazelle's Harvard University classmate, who also worked on his two prior films.[17] The lyrics were written by Pasek and Paul,[24] except for \\"Start a Fire\\", which was written by John Legend, Hurwitz, Marius De Vries and Angelique Cinelu.[43]\\r\\nA soundtrack album was released on December 9, 2016, by Interscope Records, featuring selections from Hurwitz's score and songs performed by the cast.[43]\\r\\nLa La Land had its world premiere as the Venice Film Festival's opening night film on August 31, 2016.[44][45] The film also screened at the Telluride Film Festival,[46] the Toronto International Film Festival, beginning September 12, 2016,[47] the BFI London Film Festival,[48] the Middleburg Film Festival in late October 2016, the Virginia Film Festival, held at the University of Virginia on November 6, 2016, and the AFI Fest on November 15, 2016.[49]\\r\\nThe film was originally set for a July 15, 2016, release;[50] however, in March 2016, it was announced the film would be given a limited release starting December 2, 2016, before expanding on December 16, 2016.[51] Chazelle stated that the change was because he felt that the release date was not right for the context of the film, and because he wanted to have a slow rollout beginning with the early fall film festivals.[16] The film was later pushed back a week to December 9, 2016 with the wide release still being planned for December 16, 2016.[52] Lionsgate opened the film in five locations on December 9, 2016 and expanded it to about 200 theaters on December 16, 2016 before going nationwide on December 25, 2016. The film went fully wide on January 6, 2017,[40] with a release into select IMAX theaters a week later.[53]\\r\\nLa La Land was released in the United Kingdom on January 12, 2017.[54] The film was released in the Netherlands on December 22, 2016, and in Australia on December 26, with the rest of the territories planned for a release from mid-January 2017.[55]\\r\\nLionsgate released La La Land on Digital HD on April 11, 2017, and Blu-ray, Ultra HD Blu-Ray and DVD on April 25, 2017.[56]\\r\\nLa La Land grossed $151.1 million in the United States and Canada and $295 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $446.1 million, against a production budget of $30 million.[6] Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $68.25 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it one of the top 20 most profitable releases of 2016.[57]\\r\\nLa La Land began its theatrical release with a limited release in five theaters in Los Angeles and New York City on December 9. It made $881,107 in its opening weekend, giving the film a per-theater average of $176,221, the best average of the year.[58][59][60] In its second week of limited release, the film expanded to 200 theaters and grossed $4.1 million, finishing 7th at the box office. It was an increase of 366% from the previous week and good for a per-theater of $20,510.[61] The following week, the film had its wide expansion to 734 theaters, grossing $5.8 million for the weekend (including $4 million on Christmas Day and $9.2 million over the four days), and finishing 8th at the box office.[62] On January 6, 2017, the weekend of the Golden Globes, the film expanded to 1,515 theaters and grossed $10 million over the weekend, finishing 5th at the box office.[63] In its 6th week of release, the film grossed $14.5 million (a total of $16.9 million over the four-day MLK weekend), finishing 2nd at the box office behind Hidden Figures.[64] After receiving its 14 Oscar nominations, the film expanded to 3,136 theaters on January 27, 2017 (an increase of 1,271 from the week before) and grossed $12.1 million (up 43% from its previous week's $8.4 million).[65] During the weekend of February 24ÿ26 (the weekend of the Academy Awards) the film grossed $4.6 million, exactly the same amount it grossed the previous weekend.[66] The next week, following its six Oscar wins, the film grossed $3 million.[67]\\r\\nLa La Land was met with positive reviews upon its release, with critics praising its screenplay, direction, performances, chemistry of Gosling and Stone, musical score and musical numbers.[68][69][70][71] The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 92% based on 377 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"La La Land breathes new life into a bygone genre with thrillingly assured direction, powerful performances, and an irresistible excess of heart.\\"[72] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating based on reviews, the film has a score of 93 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".[73] It was the third- and sixth-highest scoring film released in 2016 on each respective site.[74][75] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"Aÿ\\" on an A+ to F scale.[76]\\r\\nPeter Travers of Rolling Stone gave La La Land four stars out of four, describing it as \\"a hot miracle\\" and complimenting its musical numbers, particularly the opening scene. He went on to name it his favorite movie of the year.[77] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune similarly lauded the opening sequence, in addition to highlighting Stone's performance, stating \\"she's reason enough to see La La Land.\\" Despite being less enthusiastic about Gosling's dancing and the film's middle section, Phillips nevertheless gave the film four out of four stars, declaring it \\"the year's most seriously pleasurable entertainment\\".[78]\\r\\nA. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the film, stating that it \\"succeeds both as a fizzy fantasy and a hard-headed fable, a romantic comedy and a showbiz melodrama, a work of sublime artifice and touching authenticity\\".[79] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film five out of five stars, describing it as \\"a sun-drenched musical masterpiece.\\"[80] Tom Charity of Sight & Sound stated, \\"Chazelle has crafted that rare thing, a genuinely romantic comedy, and as well, a rhapsody in blue, red, yellow and green.\\"[81] Diana Dabrowska of Cinema Scope wrote, \\"La La Land may look like the world that we dream about, but it also understands the cruelty that can come out of (or undermine) those dreams; it's shot in CinemaScope, and yet it's still an intimate masterpiece.\\"[82]\\r\\nWriting for The Boston Globe in December 2016, Ty Burr summarized the effectiveness of the film to relate to audiences stating: \\"...the movie traffics in the bittersweet happiness of treasuring things that are vanishing, like the unrealized future imagined in the climatic dance number, or those inky, star-filled dance floors that go on forever in old movies, or Hollywood musicals themselves. Or jazz: Sebastian has an early moment at a nightclub where he passionately sticks up for the music he loves. It's dying on the vine, he says. And the world says Let it die. It had its time. Well, not on my watch. In that scene, he speaks for the director. By the end of La La Land, hes speaking for all of us.\\"[83]\\r\\nThe film has been criticized for its treatment of race and jazz. Kelly Lawler of USA Today noted that Gosling's character has been referred to as a \\"white savior\\" by some critics, due to \\"his quest (and eventual success) to save the traditionally black musical genre from extinction, seemingly the only person who can accomplish such a goal.\\"[84] The sentiment was also expressed by Ruby Lott-Lavigna of Wired,[85] Anna Silman of New York[86] and Ira Madison III of MTV News.[87] Rex Reed of the New York Observer also takes aim at the film's intention to emulate the MGM musical classics, noting that \\"the old-fashioned screenplay, by the ambitious writer-director Damien Chazelle, reeks of mothballs\\", and that \\"the movie sags badly in the middle, like a worn-out mattress that needs new springs\\".[88] The South China Morning Post said that the film is a little dull, that the two leads' singing and dancing aren't exceptional, and that Sebastian is a jazz snob and Mia's character lacks depth.[89]\\r\\nAt the 89th Academy Awards, La La Land received a leading six awards, including Best Director, Best Actress (for Stone), Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Original Song (\\"City of Stars\\") and Best Production Design.[90] The film received a total of 14 nominations, tying records for most nominations by a single film with All About Eve (1950) and Titanic (1997). Its other nominations included Best Picture, Best Actor (for Gosling), Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, a second nomination for Best Original Song (\\"Audition\\"), Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing.[91] During the ceremony, Faye Dunaway announced that La La Land had won Best Picture, reading it from the incorrect card Warren Beatty held, which was actually for the Best Actress award that Stone had just won. It took the show's crew more than two minutes and nearly three whole speeches to rectify the mistake; the actual winner was Moonlight.[92][93]\\r\\nAt the 74th Golden Globe Awards, La La Land received a leading seven nominations.[94] The film won in all seven categories for which it was nominated, setting a historic record for the most Golden Globes won by a single film, namely Best Motion Picture ÿ Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Actor ÿ Comedy or Musical for Gosling, Best Actress ÿ Comedy or Musical for Stone, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score and Best Original Song (\\"City of Stars\\").[95]\\r\\nLa La Land received eleven nominations at the 70th British Academy Film Awards, more than any other film of 2016.[96] The film won in the categories of Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress in a Leading Role for Stone, Best Cinematography and Best Film Music.[97]","input":"What's the movie la la land about?"},{"output":"clergy (the First Estate)","context":"The estates of the realm, or three estates, were the broad orders of social hierarchy used in Christendom (Christian Europe) from the medieval period to early modern Europe. Different systems for dividing society members into estates developed and evolved over time.\\r\\nThe best known system is the French Ancien Rgime (Old Regime), a three-estate system used until the French Revolution (1789ÿ1799). Monarchy was for the king and the queen and this system was made up of clergy (the First Estate), nobles (the Second Estate), and peasants and bourgeoisie (the Third Estate). In some regions, notably Scandinavia and Russia, burghers (the urban merchant class) and rural commoners were split into separate estates, creating a four-estate system with rural commoners ranking the lowest as the Fourth Estate. Furthermore, the non-landowning poor could be left outside the estates, leaving them without political rights. In England, a two-estate system evolved that combined nobility and bishops into one lordly estate with \\"commons\\" as the second estate. This system produced the two houses of parliament, the House of Commons and the House of Lords. In southern Germany, a three-estate system of nobility (princes and high clergy), ritters (knights), and burghers was used.\\r\\nToday the terms three estates and estates of the realm may sometimes be re-interpreted to refer to the modern separation of powers in government into the legislature, administration, and the judiciary. Additionally the term fourth estate usually refers to forces outside the established power structure (evoking medieval three-estate systems), most commonly in reference to the independent press or media. Historically, in Northern and Eastern Europe, the Fourth Estate meant rural commoners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Middle Ages, advancing to different social classes was uncommon and very difficult.\\r\\nThe medieval Church was an institution where social mobility was most likely up to a certain level (generally to that of vicar general or abbot/abbess for commoners). Typically, only nobility were appointed to the highest church positions (bishops, archbishops, heads of religious orders, etc.), although low nobility could aspire to the highest church positions. Since clergy could not marry, such mobility was theoretically limited to one generation. Nepotism was common in this period.\\r\\nAnother possible way to rise in social position was due to exceptional military or commercial success. Such families were rare and their rise to nobility required royal patronage at some point. However, because noble lines went extinct naturally, some number of ennoblements was necessary.\\r\\n\\"Medieval political speculation is imbued to the marrow with the idea of a structure of society based upon distinct orders,\\" Johan Huizinga observes.[1] The virtually synonymous terms estate and order designated a great variety of social realities, not at all limited to a class, Huizinga concluded applying to every social function, every trade, every recognisable grouping.\\r\\nThere are, first of all, the estates of the realm, but there are also the trades, the state of matrimony and that of virginity, the state of sin. At court there are the 'four estates of the body and mouth': bread-masters, cup-bearers, carvers, and cooks. In the Church there are sacerdotal orders and monastic orders. Finally there are the different orders of chivalry.[1]\\r\\nThis static view of society was predicated on inherited positions. Commoners were universally considered the lowest order. The higher estates' necessary dependency on the commoners' production, however, often further divided the otherwise equal common people into burghers (also known as bourgeoisie) of the realm's cities and towns, and the peasants and serfs of the realm's surrounding lands and villages. A person's estate and position within it were usually inherited from the father and his occupation, similar to a caste within that system. In many regions and realms there also existed population groups born outside these specifically defined resident estates.\\r\\nLegislative bodies or advisory bodies to a monarch were traditionally grouped along lines of these estates, with the monarch above all three estates. Meetings of the estates of the realm became early legislative and judicial parliaments. Monarchs often sought to legitimize their power by requiring oaths of fealty from the estates. Today, in most countries, the estates have lost all their legal privileges, and are mainly of historical interest. The nobility may be an exception, for instance due to legislation against false titles of nobility; similarly British government well maintains the distinction- witness its House of Lords, and the House of Commons.\\r\\nOne of the earliest political pamphlets to address these ideas was called \\"What Is the Third Estate?\\" (French: Qu'est-ce que le tiers-tat?) It was written by Abb Emmanuel Joseph Sieys in January 1789, shortly before the start of the French Revolution.\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, numerous geographic and ethnic kingdoms developed among the endemic peoples of Europe, affecting their day-to-day secular lives; along with those, the growing influence of the Catholic Church and its Papacy affected the ethical, moral and religious lives and decisions of all. This led to mutual dependency between the secular and religious powers for guidance and protection, but over time and with the growing power of the kingdoms, competing secular realities increasingly diverged from religious idealism and Church decisions.\\r\\nThe new lords of the land identified themselves primarily as warriors, but because new technologies of warfare were expensive, and the fighting men required substantial material resources and considerable leisure to train, these needs had to be filled. The economic and political transformation of the countryside in the period were filled by a large growth in population, agricultural production, technological innovations and urban centers; movements of reform and renewal attempted to sharpen the distinction between clerical and lay status, and power, recognized by the Church also had their effect.\\r\\nIn his book The Three Orders: Feudal Society Imagined, the French medievalist Georges Duby has shown that in the period 1023-1025 the first theorist who justified the division of European society into the three estates of the realm was Gerard of Florennes, the bishop of Cambrai.[2]\\r\\nAs a result of the Investiture Controversy of the late 11th and early 12th centuries, the powerful office of Holy Roman Emperor lost much of its religious character and retained a more nominal universal preeminence over other rulers, though it varied. The struggle over investiture and the reform movement also legitimized all secular authorities, partly on the grounds of their obligation to enforce discipline.[3]\\r\\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries thinkers argued that human society consisted of three orders: those who pray, those who fight, and those who labour. The structure of the first order, the clergy, was in place by 1200 and remained singly intact until the religious reformations of the 16th century. The very general category of those who labour (specifically, those who were not knightly warriors or nobles) diversified rapidly after the 11th century into the lively and energetic worlds of peasants, skilled artisans, merchants, financiers, lay professionals, and entrepreneurs, which together drove the European economy to its greatest achievements. The second order, those who fight, was the rank of the politically powerful, ambitious, and dangerous. Kings took pains to ensure that it did not resist their authority.[4]\\r\\nBy the 12th century, most European political thinkers agreed that monarchy was the ideal form of governance. This was because it imitated on earth the model set by God for the universe; it was the form of government of the ancient Hebrews and the Christian Biblical basis, the later Roman Empire, and also the peoples who succeeded Rome after the 4th century.[3]\\r\\nFrance under the Ancien Rgime (before the French Revolution) divided society into three estates: the First Estate (clergy); the Second Estate (nobility); and the Third Estate (commoners). The king was considered part of no estate.\\r\\nThe First Estate comprised the entire clergy, traditionally divided into \\"higher\\" and \\"lower\\" clergy. Although there was no formal demarcation between the two categories, the upper clergy were, effectively, clerical nobility, from the families of the Second Estate. In the time of Louis XVI, every bishop in France was a nobleman, a situation that had not existed before the 18th century.[5]\\r\\nAt the other extreme, the \\"lower clergy\\" (about equally divided between parish priests and monks and nuns) constituted about 90 percent of the First Estate, which in 1789 numbered around 130,000 (about 0.5% of the population).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Second Estate (Fr. deuxieme tat) was the French nobility and (technically, though not in common use) royalty, other than the monarch himself, who stood outside of the system of estates.\\r\\nThe Second Estate is traditionally divided into noblesse d'pe (\\"nobility of the sword\\"), and noblesse de robe (\\"nobility of the robe\\"), the magisterial class that administered royal justice and civil government.\\r\\nThe Second Estate constituted approximately 1.5% of France's population.[citation needed] Under the ancien rgime (\\"old rule/old government\\"), the Second Estate were exempt from the corve royale (forced labour on the roads) and from most other forms of taxation such as the gabelle (salt tax) and most important, the taille (the oldest form of direct taxation). This exemption from paying taxes led to their reluctance to reform.\\r\\nThe Third Estate comprised all of those who were not members of the above and can be divided into two groups, urban and rural, together making up 98% of France's population.[citation needed] The urban included wage-labourers. The rural included free peasants (who owned their own land) who could be prosperous and villeins (serfs, or peasants working on a noble's land). The free peasants paid disproportionately high taxes compared to the other Estates and were unhappy because they wanted more rights. In addition, the First and Second Estates relied on the labour of the Third, which made the latter's unequal status all the more glaring.\\r\\nThere were an estimated 27 million people in the Third Estate when the French Revolution started.\\r\\nThey had the hard life of physical labour and food shortages.[citation needed] Most were born within this group and died as a part of it, too. It was extremely rare for people of this ascribed status to make it out into another estate. Those who did so managed as a result of either being recognized for their extraordinary bravery in a battle or entering religious life.[6] A few commoners were able to marry into the second estate, but this was a rare occurrence.[6]\\r\\nThe first Estates General (not to be confused with a \\"class of citizen\\") was actually a general citizen assembly that was called by Philip IV in 1302.\\r\\nIn the period leading up to the Estates General of 1789, France was in the grip of an unmanageable public debt (nearly 3.56 million livres).[7] In May 1776, finance minister Turgot was dismissed, after failing to enact reforms. The next year, Jacques Necker, a foreigner, was appointed Comptroller-General of Finance. He could not be made an official minister because he was a Protestant.[8]), terrible inflation and widespread food scarcity (a huge famine in the winter of 1788-89). This led to widespread popular discontent and produced a group of Third Estate representatives (612 exactly) pressing a comparatively radical set of reforms, much of it in alignment with the goals of Finance Minister Jacques Necker, but very much against the wishes of Louis XVI's court and many of the hereditary nobles forming his Second Estate allies (at least allies against taking more taxes upon themselves and keeping the unequal taxation on the commoners).\\r\\nWhen he could not persuade them to rubber-stamp his 'ideal program', Louis XVI sought to dissolve the Estates-General, but the Third Estate held out for their right to representation. The lower clergy (and some nobles and upper clergy) eventually sided with the Third Estate, and the King was forced to yield. Thus, the Estate-General meeting was an invitation to revolution.\\r\\nBy June, when continued impasses led to further deterioration in relations, the Estates-General was reconstituted first as the National Assembly (June 17, 1789) seeking a solution for the realm independent of the King's management of the meetings of the Estates General which occasionally continued to meet. These self-organized meetings are today defined as the epoch event beginning the historical epoch (era) of the French Revolution, during which ÿ after several more weeks of civil unrest ÿ the body assumed a new status as a revolutionary legislature, the National Constituent Assembly (July 9, 1789).[9]\\r\\nThis unitary body composed of the former representatives of the three estates stepping up to govern along with an emergency committee in the power vacuum existing after the Bourbon monarchy fled Paris. Among the Assembly was Maximilien de Robespierre, an influential member of the Jacobins who would years later become instrumental in the turbulent period of violence and political upheaval in France known as the Reign of Terror (5 September 1793 ÿ 28 July 1794).[9]\\r\\nWhilst the estates were never formulated in a way that prevented social mobility, the English (subsequently the British) parliament was long based along the classic estate lines being composed on the \\"Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons\\". The tradition where the Lords Spiritual and Temporal sat separately from the Commons began during the reign of Edward III in the 14th century.\\r\\nNotwithstanding the House of Lords Act 1999, the British Parliament still recognises the existence of the three estates: the Commons in the House of Commons, the nobility in the House of Lords, and the clergy in the form of the Church of England bishops also entitled to sit in the upper House as the Lords Spiritual.\\r\\nThe members of the Parliament of Scotland were collectively referred to as the Three Estates (Older Scots: Thre Estaitis), also known as the community of the realm, and until 1690 composed of:\\r\\nThe First Estate was overthrown during the Glorious Revolution and the accession of William III.[10] The Second Estate was then split into two to retain the division into three.\\r\\nA Shire Commissioner was the closest equivalent of the English office of Member of Parliament, namely a commoner or member of the lower nobility. Because the Parliament of Scotland was unicameral, all members sat in the same chamber, as opposed to the separate English House of Lords and House of Commons.\\r\\nThe Parliament also had University constituencies (see Ancient universities of Scotland). The system was also adopted by the Parliament of England when James VI ascended to the English throne. It was believed that the universities were affected by the decisions of Parliament and ought therefore to have representation in it. This continued in the Parliament of Great Britain after 1707 and the Parliament of the United Kingdom until 1950.[11]\\r\\nThe Estates in Sweden (including Finland) and later also Russia's Grand Duchy of Finland were the two higher estates, nobility and clergy, and the two lower estates, burghers and land-owning peasants. Each were free men, and had specific rights and responsibilities, and the right to send representatives to the Riksdag of the Estates. At the Riksdag, each Estate voted as a single body. Since early 18th century, a bill needed the approval of at least three Estates to pass, and constitutional amendments required the approval of all Estates. Prior to the 18th century, the King had the right to cast a deciding vote if the Estates were split evenly.\\r\\nAfter Russia's conquest of Finland in 1809, a Finnish House of Nobility was codified in 1818 in accordance with the old Swedish law of 1723. However the Diet of Finland and its four estates was not convened until 1863.\\r\\nThere was also a population outside the estates. Unlike in other areas, people had no \\"default\\" estate, and were not peasants unless they came from a land-owner's family. A summary of this division is:\\r\\nIn Sweden, the Riksdag of the Estates existed until it was replaced with a bicameral Riksdag in 1866, which gave political rights to anyone with a certain income or property. Nevertheless, many of the leading politicians of the 19th century continued to be drawn from the old estates, in that they were either noblemen themselves, or represented agricultural and urban interests. Ennoblements continued even after the estates had lost their political importance, with the last ennoblement of explorer Sven Hedin taking place in 1902; this practice was formally abolished with the adoption of the new Constitution January 1, 1975, while the status of the House of Nobility continued to be regulated in law until 2003.\\r\\nIn Finland, this legal division existed until 1906, still drawing on the Swedish constitution of 1772. However, at the start of the 20th century most of the population did not belong to any Estate and had no political representation. A particularly large class were the rent farmers, who did not own the land they cultivated but had to work in the land-owner's farm to pay their rent (unlike Russia, there were no slaves or serfs.) Furthermore, the industrial workers living in the city were not represented by the four-estate system.\\r\\nThe political system was reformed as a result of the Finnish general strike of 1905, with the last Diet instituting a new constitutional law to create the modern parliamentary system, ending the political privileges of the estates. The post-independence constitution of 1919 forbade ennoblement, and all tax privileges were abolished in 1920. The privileges of the estates were officially and finally abolished in 1995,[12] although in legal practice, the privileges had long been unenforceable. As in Sweden, the nobility has not been officially abolished and records of nobility are still voluntarily maintained by the Finnish House of Nobility.\\r\\nIn Finland, it is still illegal and punishable by jail time (up to one year) to defraud into marriage by declaring a false name or estate (Rikoslaki 18 luku  1/Strafflagen 18 kap.  1).\\r\\nThe Low Countries, which until the late sixteenth century consisted of several counties, prince bishoprics, duchies etc. in the area that is now modern Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, had no States General until 1464, when Duke Philip of Burgundy assembled the first States General in Bruges. Later in the 15th and 16th centuries Brussels became the place where the States General assembled. On these occasions deputies from the States of the various provinces (as the counties, prince-bishoprics and duchies were called) asked for more liberties. For this reason, the States General were not assembled very often.\\r\\nAs a consequence of the Union of Utrecht in 1579 and the events that followed afterwards, the States General declared that they no longer obeyed King Philip II of Spain, who was also overlord of the Netherlands. After the reconquest of the southern Netherlands (roughly Belgium and Luxemburg), the States General of the Dutch Republic first assembled permanently in Middelburg, and in The Hague from 1585 onward. Without a king to rule the country, the States General became the sovereign power. It was the level of government where all things were dealt with that were of concern to all the seven provinces that became part of the Republic of the United Netherlands.\\r\\nDuring that time the States General were formed by representatives of the States (i.e. provincial parliaments) of the seven provinces. In each States (a plurale tantum) sat representatives of the nobility and the cities (the clergy were no longer represented; in Friesland the peasants were indirectly represented by the Grietmannen).\\r\\nIn the Southern Netherlands, the last meetings of the States General loyal to the Habsburgs took place in the Estates General of 1600 and the Estates General of 1632.\\r\\nAs a government, the States General of the Dutch Republic were abolished in 1795. A new parliament was created, called Nationale Vergadering (National Assembly). It no longer consisted of representatives of the States, let alone the Estates: all men were considered equal under the 1798 Constitution. Eventually, the Netherlands became part of the French Empire under Napoleon (1810: La Hollande est reunie  l'Empire).\\r\\nAfter regaining independence in November 1813, the name \\"States General\\" was resurrected for a legislature constituted in 1814 and elected by the States-Provincial. In 1815, when the Netherlands were united with Belgium and Luxemburg, the States General were divided into two chambers: the First Chamber and the Second Chamber. The members of the First Chamber were appointed for life by the King, while the members of the Second Chamber were elected by the members of the States Provincial. The States General resided in The Hague and Brussels in alternate years until 1830, when, as a result of the Belgian Revolution, The Hague became once again the sole residence of the States General, Brussels instead hosting the newly founded Belgian Parliament.\\r\\nFrom 1848 on, the Dutch Constitution provides that members of the Second Chamber be elected by the people (at first only by a limited portion of the male population; universal male and female suffrage exists since 1919), while the members of the First Chamber are chosen by the members of the States Provincial. As a result, the Second Chamber became the most important. The First Chamber is also called Senate. This however, is not a term used in the Constitution.\\r\\nOccasionally the First and Second Chamber meet in a Verenigde Vergadering (Joint Session), for instance on Prinsjesdag, the annual opening of the parliamentary year, and when a new king is inaugurated.\\r\\nThe Holy Roman Empire had the Imperial Diet (Reichstag). The clergy was represented by the independent prince-bishops, prince-archbishops and prince-abbots of the many monasteries. The nobility consisted of independent aristocratic rulers: secular prince-electors, kings, dukes, margraves, counts and others. Burghers consisted of representatives of the independent imperial cities. Many peoples whose territories within the Holy Roman Empire had been independent for centuries had no representatives in the Imperial Diet, and this included the Imperial Knights and independent villages. The power of the Imperial Diet was limited, despite efforts of centralization.\\r\\nLarge realms of the nobility or clergy had estates of their own that could wield great power in local affairs. Power struggles between ruler and estates were comparable to similar events in the history of the British and French parliaments.\\r\\nThe Swabian League, a significant regional power in its part of Germany during the 15th Century, also had its own kind of Estates, a governing Federal Council comprising three Colleges: those of Princes, Cities, and Knights.\\r\\nIn the late Russian Empire the estates were called sosloviyes. The four major estates were: nobility (dvoryanstvo), clergy, rural dwellers, and urban dwellers, with a more detailed stratification therein. The division in estates was of mixed nature: traditional, occupational, as well as formal: for example, voting in Duma was carried out by estates. Russian Empire Census recorded the reported estate of a person.\\r\\nThe Parliament of Catalonia was first established in 1283 as the Catalan Courts (Corts Catalanes), according to American historian Thomas Bisson, and it has been considered by several historians as a model of medieval parliament. For instance, English historian of constitutionalism Charles Howard McIlwain wrote that the General Courts of Catalonia, during the 14th century, had a more defined organization and met more regularly than the parliaments of England or France.[13]\\r\\nThe roots of the parliament institution in Catalonia are in the Sanctuary and Truce Assemblies (assemblees de pau i treva) that started in the 11th century. The members of the parliament of Catalonia were organized in the Three Estates (Catalan: Tres Estats):\\r\\nThe parliament institution was abolished in 1716, together with the rest of institutions of Catalonia, after the War of the Spanish Succession.\\r\\nLocation specific:\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"What are the three estates in french society?"},{"output":"macOS","context":"The MacBook Pro (sometimes abbreviated MBP)[1] is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc. Replacing the PowerBook G4, the MacBook Pro was the second model to be announced during the AppleÿIntel transition, after the iMac. It is the high-end model of the MacBook family and is currently available in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. A 17-inch version was available between April 2006 and June 2012.\\r\\nThe first generation MacBook Pro appeared externally similar to the PowerBook G4, but used Intel Core processors instead of PowerPC G4 chips. The 15-inch model was introduced first, in January 2006; the 17-inch model followed in April. Both received several updates and Core 2 Duo processors later that year.\\r\\nThe product's second iteration, known as the \\"unibody\\" model, has a casing made from a single piece of aluminum. It debuted in October 2008 in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. In January 2009, the 17-inch model was updated with the same unibody design. Subsequent updates brought upgraded Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and introduced Intel's Thunderbolt technology.\\r\\nApple released the third generation of MacBook Pro with a 15-inch screen during WWDC 2012 and discontinued the 17-inch variant. The previous generation 13- and 15-inch unibody models continued to sell with updated processors. The third generation model was a quarter thinner than its predecessor and introduced the Retina Display with a much higher screen resolution. A 13-inch variant was released in October 2012.\\r\\nThe fourth generation MacBook Pro was announced on October 27, 2016. It replaced the function keys with an interactive, multi-touch \\"Touch Bar\\" and a Touch ID sensor integrated into the Power button. The 15-inch notebook started at $2,399, compared to $1,999 for the previous iteration.[2] On 5 June 2017, Apple upgraded the internals of the MacBook Pro, such as enhanced Iris Plus and AMD Radeon graphics, Kaby Lake processors, and added memory. Additionally, the 13-inch MacBook Pro now comes with a 128GB storage option (down from the base 256GB storage) with a lowered starting price of $1299. All other configurations of the MacBook Pro have the same price as last year, barring the incremental upgrades in processors and graphics.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006 by Steve Jobs at the Macworld Conference & Expo.[4] The 17-inch model was unveiled on April 24, 2006.[5] The first design was largely a carryover from the PowerBook G4, but uses Intel Core CPUs instead of PowerPC G4 chips.[6] The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs the same as the 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, but is 0.1 inches (0.25?cm) deeper, 0.4 inches (1.0?cm) wider, and 0.1 inches (0.25?cm) thinner.[7] Other changes from the PowerBook include a built-in iSight webcam and the inclusion of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when yanked. These features were later brought over to the MacBook. The optical drive was reduced in size in order to fit into the slimmer MacBook Pro, hence it runs slower than the optical drive in the PowerBook G4 and cannot write to dual layer DVDs.[6][8]\\r\\nBoth the original 15- and 17-inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots found in the PowerBook G4. All first generation 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port,[9] while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports as well as one FireWire 400 port.[10] When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S-Video ports,[7][9] although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision[11] and is present in every version of the 17-inch design.[10] S-Video capability can be attained through the use of a DVI to S-Video adapter.[7] External displays with up to a 2,560?G?1,600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual-link DVI port.[12] All models include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g.[9][10] Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n[13] and Bluetooth 2.1.\\r\\nApple refreshed the entire MacBook Pro line on October 24, 2006 to include Intel Core 2 Duo processors.[11] Memory capacity was doubled for each model, to 1?GB on the low-end 15-inch and 2?GB for the high-end 15- and 17-inch models.[11] FireWire 800 was added to the 15-inch models. Hard drive capacity was increased, although video card options stayed the same.[11] The MacBook Pro line received a second update on June 5, 2007 with new Nvidia Geforce 8600M GT video cards and faster processor options.[14][15] LED backlighting was added to the 15-inch model's screen, and its weight was reduced from 5.6 pounds (2.5?kg) to 5.4 pounds (2.4?kg).[15] Furthermore, the speed of the front-side bus was increased from 667?MHz to 800?MHz. On November 1, 2007, Apple added the option of a 2.6?GHz Santa Rosa platform Core 2 Duo CPU as well as reconfigured hard drive options.[15]\\r\\nOn February 26, 2008, the MacBook Pro line was again updated.[16][17] LED backlighting was added as an option for the 17-inch model.[16] Processors were updated to \\"Penryn\\" cores, which are built on the 45 nanometer process (65 nanometer \\"Merom\\" cores were previously used), and hard drive and memory capacities were increased.[16] Multi-touch capabilities, first introduced with the MacBook Air earlier that year, were brought over to the MacBook Pro's trackpad.[16] When the 15-inch unibody MacBook Pro was introduced on October 14, 2008, the pre-unibody model with the same screen size was discontinued, while the 17-inch pre-unibody model continued to be sold.[18] The original case design was discontinued on January 6, 2009, when the 17-inch MacBook Pro was also updated with unibody construction.[19]\\r\\nSome reviewers applauded the MacBook Pro for its doubling or tripling the speed of the PowerBook G4 in some areas.[6] For example, the 3D rendering program Cinema 4D XL was 3.3?times as fast (2.3 times faster),[6] and its boot-up time was more than twice as quick.[7] The MacBook Pro generally outperformed the PowerBook G4 in performance analyzer utility tests XBench and Cinebench.[7] Reviewers lauded the screen's maximum brightness, 67?percent higher than the PowerBook G4; the excellent horizontal viewing angles; the matte options; and the bright, crisp, and true colors.[8] Although the screen offered fewer vertical pixels (1,440?G?900 in the MacBook Pro instead of 1,440?G?960 in the PowerBook), one reviewer called the screen \\"nothing less than stellar\\".[7] Reviewers praised the new MagSafe power adapter,[6] although one reviewer said it disconnected too easily in some instances.[7] They also praised the backlit keyboard, large trackpad, and the virtually silent operation of the machine.[6][8] The new laptop also offered better wireless performance.\\r\\nOne reviewer criticized the decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30?percent its original speed.[8] The notebook was also noted for running hot.[6][8] Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks.[7] Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models.[7] Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings.[7] Apple increased the battery capacity by 10?Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60,[7] but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power.[7] Battery life therefore remained about the same as in previous models, at three-plus hours.[7]\\r\\nSuperDrive: 8G DVD-DL discs reads. 4G DVD+/-R & RW recording. 24G CD-R and 10G CD-RW recording\\r\\n(optional for 15-inch)\\r\\nSuperDrive: 4G DVD+R writes, 8G DVD+/-R read, 4G DVD+/-RW writes, 24G CD-R, and 10G CD-RW recording (17-inch)\\r\\nOn October 14, 2008, in a press event at company headquarters, Apple officials announced a new 15-inch MacBook Pro featuring a \\"precision aluminum unibody enclosure\\" and tapered sides similar to those of the MacBook Air.[30][31] Designers shifted the MacBook Pro's ports to the left side of the case, and moved the optical disc drive slot from the front to the right side, similar to the MacBook. The new MacBook Pros had two video cards, which the user could switch between: the Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT with either 256 or 512?MB of dedicated memory and a GeForce 9400M with 256?MB of shared system memory.[30] Although the FireWire 400 port was removed, the FireWire 800 port was retained. The DVI port was replaced with a Mini DisplayPort receptacle.[30] The original unibody MacBook Pro came with a user-removable battery; Apple claimed five hours of use,[30] with one reviewer reporting results closer to four on a continuous video battery stress test.[32] Apple said that the battery would hold 80?percent of its charge after 300 recharges.[33]\\r\\nThe unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely follows the styling of the original aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display.[30] The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option is available in the 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed.[34] The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button.[34] The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures.[34] When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad.[35][36][37] The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.[35]\\r\\nDuring the MacWorld Expo keynote on January 6, 2009, Phil Schiller announced a 17-inch MacBook Pro with unibody construction. This version diverged from its 15-inch sibling with an anti-glare \\"matte\\" screen option (with the glossy finish standard) and a non user-removable lithium polymer battery.[38] Instead of traditional round cells inside the casing, the lithium-ion polymer batteries are shaped and fitted into each laptop to maximally utilize space. Adaptive charging, which uses a chip to optimize the charge flow to reduce wear and tear, extends the battery's overall life.[38] Battery life for the 17\\" version is quoted at eight hours, with 80?percent of this charge remaining after 1,000 charge-discharge cycles.[38]\\r\\nAt Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 8, 2009, it was announced that the 13-inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re-branded as a MacBook Pro,[39] leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line.[40] It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user-removable battery first introduced in the 17-inch MacBook Pro.[41] The updated MacBook Pro 13- and the 15-inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life, while the 17-inch would keep its eight-hour capacity.[39][41] Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros during casual use,[42] while others reported around six hours.[34] Like the 17-inch MacBook Pro, Apple claims that they will last around 1,000 charge cycles while still containing 80?percent of their capacity.[43] Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release, although the 13-inch[44] and the base model 15-inch, came with only the GeForce 9400M GPU.[45] The screens were also improved, gaining a claimed 60?percent greater color gamut.[44][45] All of these mid 2009 models also included a FireWire 800 port and all except the 17-inch models would receive an SD card slot.[31] The 17-inch model would retain its ExpressCard/34 slot.[41] For the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Kensington lock slot was moved to the right side of the chassis.[46] In August 2009, Apple extended the \\"matte\\" anti-glare display option to the 15-inch MacBook Pro.[47]\\r\\nOn April 13, 2010,[48] Intel Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs were introduced in the 15- and 17-inch models, while the 13-inch retained the Core 2 Duo with a speed increase.[48] The power brick was redesigned[35] and a high-resolution display (of 1,680?G?1,050) was announced as an option for the 15-inch models.[36] The 13-inch gained an integrated Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics processing unit (GPU) with 256?MB of shared memory, while the 15- and 17-inch models were upgraded to the GeForce GT 330M, with either 256 or 512?MB of dedicated memory.[48] The 15- and 17-inch models also have an integrated Intel GPU that is built into the Core i5 and i7 processors.[48] The 15-inch model also gained 0.1 pounds (0.045?kg).[36] Save for a third USB 2.0 slot, all the ports on the 17-inch MacBook Pro are the same in type and number as on the 15-inch version.[49] All models come with 4?GB of system memory that is upgradeable to 8?GB.[48] Battery life was also extended further in this update, to an estimated ten hours for the 13-inch and 8ÿ9 hours on the 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros.[48] This was achieved through both greater power efficiency and adding more battery capacity.[48] One reviewer reported about six hours of battery life through a continuous video battery stress test in the 15-inch[37] and another, who called the battery life \\"unbeatable,\\" reported nearer to eight in the 13-inch through their \\"highly demanding battery drain test\\".[35]\\r\\nThunderbolt technology, Sandy Bridge dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 (on the 13-inch model) or quad-core i7 (on the 15- and 17-inch models) processors, and a high definition FaceTime camera were added on February 24, 2011. Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M graphics cards. Later editions of these models, following the release of OS X Lion, replaced the dashboard (F4) key with a launchpad key. The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models.[50] The Thunderbolt serial bus platform can achieve speeds of up to 10?Gbit/s,[51] which is up to twice as fast as the USB 3.0 specification, 20 times faster than the USB 2.0 specification, and up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800.[52] Apple says that Thunderbolt can be used to drive displays or to transfer large quantities of data in a short amount of time.[52]\\r\\nOn June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its upgraded Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco.[53] The new MacBook Pro models were updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB.[54] Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a media event on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros except for the entry-level 2.5?GHz 13-inch model.[55] Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016. Prior to its discontinuation it was Apples only product to still include an optical drive and a Firewire port, and only laptop with a hard disk drive and Ethernet port.[56]\\r\\nSome reviewers praised the new laptop's performance and compact size,[32] the quality of the screen, and sturdy unibody build,[32] which allowed easier upgrading of internal components as compared to the original models.[32] Some reviewers also noted that the new MacBook Pro ran more quietly and at cooler temperatures than first generation machines.[32] Others, however, criticized the amount of heat generated by the new design.[57][58]\\r\\nReviewers lamented the loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight, even when its brightness was turned all the way up.[32] CNET's Dan Ackerman commented of the mid-2009 models: \\"According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions.\\"[34] By 2011, matte screens were offered for both the 15\\" and 17\\" models. Furthermore, the addition of Mini DisplayPort instead of the more popular HDMI was criticized.[32] The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also bemoaned.[32]\\r\\nLaptop Magazine's Michael Prospero praised the 2010 15-inch model's display, calling it \\"bright and crisp\\". He further commented, \\"While reflections from the glossy display weren't overwhelming, it's also nice to know there's an antiglare optionthough only for the higher resolution display. Still, colors were bright, blacks were deep and dark, and viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally.\\" He also lauded the quality of the iSight webcam, the responsiveness of the touchpad, the microphone and speakers, as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15\\" model and the long battery life. Complaints included the price of the laptop, the low number of USB ports, and the lack of HDMI.[36]\\r\\nCNET praised the automatic graphics switching features of the 15- and 17-inch 2010 models as well as the graphics cards themselves. Acclaim was also given to the Core i5 and i7 CPUs, the multi-touch trackpad, and the addition of audio capabilities to the Mini DisplayPort video output.[37] They also called for the addition of HDMI and the Blu-ray optical disc format, saying that most other computers in the MacBook Pro's price range possessed these features.[37] CNET also criticized the option of a higher resolution screen in the 15-inch model, saying that \\"the higher-resolution screen should be included by default.\\"[37]\\r\\n2.53?GHz (T9400) Intel Core 2 Duo Penryn with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (T9600) with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache\\r\\n2.8?GHz (T9600) (15\\" and 17\\" only) Intel Core 2 Duo Penryn with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.06?GHz (T9900) with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache (15\\" and 17\\" only)\\r\\nSince the RAM and the hard drive on some generations of MacBook Pro are user serviceable parts, there are aftermarket modifications to enhance the system with up to 16GB of DDR3-1600 RAM (maximum capacity and frequency depend on the hardware in question), 7200-rpm hard drives or third party SSDs.\\r\\nEarly and Late 2011 models reportedly suffer from manufacturing problems leading to overheating, graphical issues, and eventually complete GPU and logic board failure. A thread was opened on the Apple Support community[89] that reached more than 12,000 posts and 4,000,000 visits (Feb 2015). A similar but nonidentical issue affected iMac GPUs which were later recalled by Apple.[90] The problem was covered by many articles in Mac-focused magazines, starting late 2013 throughout 2014.[91][92][93][94][95] In August 2014 the law firm Whitfield Bryson & Mason LLP had begun investigating the problem to determine if any legal claim exists.[96] On October 28, 2014, the firm announced that it has filed a class-action lawsuit in a California federal court against Apple. The lawsuit will cover residents residing in both California and Florida who have purchased a 2011 MacBook Pro notebook with an AMD graphics card. The firm is also investigating similar cases across the United States.[97] On February 20, 2015, Apple instituted the \\"MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues\\".? This \\"will repair affected MacBook Pro systems, free of charge.\\"\\r\\nOn June 11, 2012 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, Apple introduced the third generation MacBook Pro, marketed as the \\"MacBook Pro with Retina display\\" to differentiate it from the predecessor model.[53] The new model includes Intel's third generation Core i7 processors (Ivy Bridge microarchitecture), USB 3.0, and a high-resolution 15.4\\" IPS 2880G1800-pixel Retina Display.[54] Other new or changed features include a second Thunderbolt port, a HDMI port, and a thinner MagSafe port, dubbed the \\"MagSafe 2\\".[98] Apple introduced a 13-inch version on October 23, 2012 with specifications similar but slightly inferior to the 15-inch version's, such as less powerful processors.[99]\\r\\nThe new models omit Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports, though Apple offers Thunderbolt adapters for both interfaces.[100] They also omit a SuperDrive, making the 15-inch model Apple's first professional notebook since the PowerBook 2400c to ship without a built-in optical drive.[101] Instead of a hard disk drive, the new models ship with a solid state drive housed in a proprietary flash module design rather than a 2.5\\" notebook drive. Apple also claims improved speakers and microphones and a new system for cooling the notebook with improved fans.[98] The new case design does not have a Kensington lock slot, so alternative products are required to physically secure the computer.[102]\\r\\nThe Retina models also have fewer user-accessible upgrade or replacement options than previous MacBooks. Unlike in previous generations, the memory is soldered onto the logic board and is therefore not upgradable. The solid state drive is not soldered and can be replaced by users.[103] The battery is glued into place; attempts to remove it may destroy the battery and/or trackpad.[104] The entire case uses proprietary pentalobe screws and cannot be disassembled with standard tools. While the battery is glued in, recycling companies have stated that the design is only \\"mildly inconvenient\\" and does not hamper the recycling process.[105]\\r\\nOn February 13, 2013, Apple announced updated prices and processors for the MacBook Pro with Retina Display and increased the RAM of the high-end 15-inch model to 16 GB.[106]\\r\\nOn October 22, 2013, Apple updated the line with Intel's Haswell processors and Iris Graphics, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Thunderbolt 2, and PCIe-based flash storage.[107] The chassis of the 13-inch version was slightly slimmed to 0.71 inches (18?mm) to match the 15-inch model. The lower-end 15-inch model only included integrated graphics while the higher-end model continued to include a discrete Nvidia graphics card in addition to integrated graphics.[108] Support for 4K video output via HDMI was added but limited the maximum number of external displays from three to two.[109] On July 29, 2014 Apple announced updated prices and processors for the Haswell MacBook Pro with Retina Display.[110]\\r\\nOn March 9, 2015, the 13-inch model was updated with Intel Broadwell processors, Iris 6100 graphics, faster flash storage, increased battery life, and a Force Touch trackpad.[111][112] On May 19, 2015, the 15-inch model was also updated with similarly fast flash storage, increased battery life, the Force Touch trackpad, and an AMD Radeon R9 discrete graphics card on the higher-end model.[113][114] The higher-end 15-inch model also added support for dual-cable output to 5120G2880 displays.[115] The 15-inch models were released with the same Intel Haswell processors and Iris Pro graphics as the 2014 models due to a delay in shipment of newer Broadwell quad-core processors.[116]\\r\\nThe Retina Display MacBook Pro largely follows the design of the previous generation with its aluminum enclosure and separated black keys. The most apparent body changes are a thinner chassis and a display with a redesigned hinge and thinner bezel and the removal of the internal optical drive. The power button is moved from the upper right corner of the chassis onto the keyboard, taking the place of the optical disc eject button.[117] At 0.71 inches (18?mm) thick, the 15-inch model is 25?percent thinner than its predecessor. The model name is no longer placed at the bottom of the screen bezel; instead, it is found on the underside of the chassis, similar to an iOS device. It is the first Macintosh laptop to not have its model name visible during normal use, as every prior laptop had its model name on the screen bezel or keyboard.[118]\\r\\nThe third generation MacBook Pro received positive reviews of the Retina Display, flash storage and power. It was criticized, however, for its high price and lack of an Ethernet port and optical drive. Roman Loyola of Macworld said that the Retina MacBook Pro was \\"groundbreaking\\" and made people \\"rethink how they use technology.\\" He praised the inclusion of USB 3.0 and the slimmer body.[119] Dan Ackerman of CNET commented \\"I've previously called the 15-inch MacBook Pro one of the most universally useful all-around laptops you can buy. This new version adds to that with HDMI, faster ports, and more portability. But it also subtracts from that with its exclusion of an optical drive and Ethernet port, plus its very high starting price. The Pro and Retina Pro are clearly two laptops designed for two different users, and with the exception of all-day commuters who need something closer to a MacBook Air or ultrabook, one of the two branches of the MacBook Pro family tree is still probably the most universally useful laptop you can buy.\\"[120]\\r\\nJoel Santo Domingo of PC Magazine gave the MacBook Pro an \\"Editor's Choice\\" rating. He praised its \\"brilliant Retina display,\\" the thin design, port selection and speedy storage, and highlighted the expandability via Thunderbolt ports which support up to seven devices each.[121] David Pogue of The New York Times praised the 15-inch model's screen, keyboard, sound, start-up time, cosmetics, battery life, storage, and RAM capacity. They criticized the lack of a SuperDrive, pricing, and the MagSafe 2 power connector's lack of backwards compatibility with the older MagSafe design.[122]\\r\\nSince the battery is glued in and cannot be easily disassembled for recycling (an EPEAT requirement), Apple received criticisms about the machine's ability to be recycled. Greenpeace spokesman Casey Harrell said Apple \\"has pitted design against the environmentand chosen design. They're making a big bet that people don't care, but recycling is a big issue.\\"[123] Wired also criticized Apple's recyclability claims, stating \\"[t]he design may well be comprised of 'highly recyclable aluminum and glass'but my friends in the electronics recycling industry tell me they have no way of recycling aluminum that has glass glued to it like Apple did with both this machine and the recent iPad.\\"[124]\\r\\nThe Retina Display on the MacBook Pro have been criticized for \\"image retention,\\" specifically for displays manufactured by LG.[125][126]\\r\\nOptional 2.6?GHz (i7-3720QM) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.7?GHz (i7-3820QM) with 8?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.9?GHz (i7-3520M) dual-core Intel Core i7 Ivy Bridge processor with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.0?GHz (i7-3540M) dual-core Intel Core i7 Ivy Bridge with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.6?GHz (i5-4288U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Haswell with 3?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-4558U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Haswell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i5-4308U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Haswell with 3?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.0?GHz (i7-4578U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Haswell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.9?GHz (i5-5287U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Broadwell with 3?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.1?GHz (i7-5557U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Broadwell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.5?GHz (i7-4870HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-4980HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.7?GHz (i7-3740QM) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-3840QM) with 8?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.3?GHz (i7-4850HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.6?GHz (i7-4960HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.5?GHz (i7-4870HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-4980HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nApple unveiled fourth generation 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models during a press event at their headquarters on October 27, 2016. The models introduced the Touch Bar, a multi-touch enabled OLED strip built into the top of the keyboard in place of the function keys. They include a sapphire-glass covered Touch ID sensor at the right end of the Touch Bar which doubles as a power button. The models also introduce a \\"second-generation\\" butterfly mechanism keyboard that provided more travel than the first iteration implemented on the Retina MacBook. The 13-inch model has a trackpad that is 46% larger than its predecessor while the 15-inch model has a trackpad twice as large as the prior generation.\\r\\nAll ports have been replaced with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals,[138] any of which can be used for charging.[139] The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals,[140][141] including Intels own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices.[142] Furthermore, MacOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them.[143] Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro.[139][144][145] The models come with a 3.5mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.\\r\\nOther updates to the MacBook Pro include dual and quad-core Intel \\"Skylake\\" Core i5 and i7 processors, improved graphics, and displays that offer a 25% wider color gamut, 67% more brightness, and 67% more contrast. All versions are able to output to a 5K display, with the 15-inch models capable of two. The 15-inch models include a discrete Radeon Pro 450, 455 or 460 graphics card in addition to the integrated Intel graphics. Additionally, Apple introduced a cheaper lower-end 13-inch model which lacks the Touch Bar in favor of function keys, and has only two USB-C ports. The flash storage in the Touch Bar models is soldered to the logic board and is not upgradeable, while in the 13-inch model without Touch Bar, it is removable.[146][147]\\r\\nThe fourth generation MacBook Pro follows the design of the previous two generations with an all-metal unibody enclosure and separated black keys. A few apparent design changes are a thinner chassis, thinner screen bezel, larger trackpad, the OLED Touch Bar, and shallower butterfly mechanism keyboard with less key separation than the previous models. The speakers grilles have been relocated to the sides of the keyboard on the 13-inch variant. Tear downs show that the speaker grilles on the 13-inch model with Touch Bar are \\"largely cosmetic\\", and that sound output mostly comes through the side vents.[148] The fourth generation MacBook Pro comes in two finishes, the traditional silver color and a darker \\"space gray\\" color. The MacBook Pro model name returns to the bottom of the screen bezel in Apple's San Francisco font after being absent from the third generation. Similar to the Retina MacBook, the new models replace the backlit Apple logo on the rear of the screen with a glossy opaque version.\\r\\nMagSafe, a magnetic charging connector, has been replaced with USB-C charging.[139] Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the users field of view to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a chime when connected to power.[139] The Macintosh startup chime that has been used since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.[139]\\r\\nThe 2016 MacBook Pro received mixed reviews. Ars Technica noted that the keyboard was a \\"drastic departure\\" from previous MacBook Pro keyboards, being a second-generation version of the keyboard used in the Retina MacBook. It further noted that resting palms may brush the trackpad occasionally causing inadvertent cursor jumps onscreen as the laptop interprets this as input, without one's hands or wrists actually resting on it.[139] Also noted was an increase of bandwidth and approximately 40 percent increased read speed of the flash storage.[139] Engadget praised the thinner, lighter design, improved display and audio, and increased speed of the graphics and flash storage, but criticized the lack of ports and price.[149] Wired praised the display, calling it \\"the best laptop display I've ever seen\\", as well as praising the Touch Bar, though it criticized the need of adapters for many common connectors.[150] Likewise, The Verge concluded that \\"using [the new MacBook] is alienating to anyone living in the present.

It is acknowledged internationally in many other cultures. The multi-day holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died, and help support their spiritual journey. In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.[1]\\r\\nThe holiday is sometimes called Da de los Muertos[2][3] in Anglophone countries, a back-translation of its original name, Da de Muertos. It is particularly celebrated in Mexico where the day is a public holiday. Prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century, the celebration took place at the beginning of summer. Gradually, it was associated with October 31, November 1, and November 2 to coincide with the Western Christianity triduum of Allhallowtide: All Saints' Eve, All Saints' Day, and All Souls' Day.[4][5] Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars called ofrendas, honoring the deceased using calaveras, aztec marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.[6] Visitors also leave possessions of the deceased at the graves.\\r\\nScholars trace the origins of the modern Mexican holiday to indigenous observances dating back hundreds of years and to an Aztec festival dedicated to the goddess Mictecacihuatl. The holiday has spread throughout the world, being absorbed into other deep traditions in honor of the dead. It has become a national symbol and as such is taught (for educational purposes) in the nation's schools. Many families celebrate a traditional \\"All Saints' Day\\" associated with the Catholic Church.\\r\\nOriginally, the Day of the Dead as such was not celebrated in northern Mexico, where it was unknown until the 20th century because its indigenous people had different traditions. The people and the church rejected it as a day related to syncretizing pagan elements with Catholic Christianity. They held the traditional 'All Saints' Day' in the same way as other Christians in the world. There was limited Mesoamerican influence in this region, and relatively few indigenous inhabitants from the regions of Southern Mexico, where the holiday was celebrated. In the early 21st century in northern Mexico, Da de Muertos is observed because the Mexican government made it a national holiday based on educational policies from the 1960s; it has introduced this holiday as a unifying national tradition based on indigenous traditions.[7][8][9]\\r\\nThe Mexican Day of the Dead celebration is similar to other societies' observances of a time to honor the dead. The Spanish tradition, for instance, includes festivals and parades, as well as gatherings of families at cemeteries to pray for their deceased loved ones at the end of the day.[10]\\r\\nThe Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico developed from ancient traditions among its pre-Columbian cultures. Rituals celebrating the deaths of ancestors had been observed by these civilizations perhaps for as long as 2,500ÿ3,000 years.[11] The festival that developed into the modern Day of the Dead fell in the ninth month of the Aztec calendar, about the beginning of August, and was celebrated for an entire month. The festivities were dedicated to the goddess[12] known as the \\"Lady of the Dead\\", corresponding to the modern La Calavera Catrina.\\r\\nBy the late 20th century in most regions of Mexico, practices had developed to honor dead children and infants on November 1, and to honor deceased adults on November 2. November 1 is generally referred to as Da de los Inocentes (\\"Day of the Innocents\\") but also as Da de los Angelitos (\\"Day of the Little Angels\\"); November 2 is referred to as Da de los Muertos or Da de los Difuntos (\\"Day of the Dead\\").[13]\\r\\nFrances Ann Day summarizes the three-day celebration, the Day of the Dead:\\r\\nPeople go to cemeteries to be with the souls of the departed and build private altars containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so the souls will hear the prayers and the comments of the living directed to them. Celebrations can take a humorous tone, as celebrants remember funny events and anecdotes about the departed.[13]\\r\\nPlans for the day are made throughout the year, including gathering the goods to be offered to the dead. During the three-day period families usually clean and decorate graves;[12] most visit the cemeteries where their loved ones are buried and decorate their graves with ofrendas (altars), which often include orange Mexican marigolds (Tagetes erecta) called cempas~chil (originally named cempoaxochitl, Nhuatl for \\"twenty flowers\\"). In modern Mexico the marigold is sometimes called Flor de Muerto (Flower of Dead). These flowers are thought to attract souls of the dead to the offerings.\\r\\nToys are brought for dead children (los angelitos, or \\"the little angels\\"), and bottles of tequila, mezcal or pulque or jars of atole for adults. Families will also offer trinkets or the deceased's favorite candies on the grave. Some families have ofrendas in homes, usually with foods such as candied pumpkin, pan de muerto (\\"bread of dead\\"), and sugar skulls; and beverages such as atole. The ofrendas are left out in the homes as a welcoming gesture for the deceased.[12] Some people believe the spirits of the dead eat the \\"spiritual essence\\" of the ofrendas food, so though the celebrators eat the food after the festivities, they believe it lacks nutritional value. Pillows and blankets are left out so the deceased can rest after their long journey. In some parts of Mexico, such as the towns of Mixquic, Ptzcuaro and Janitzio, people spend all night beside the graves of their relatives. In many places, people have picnics at the grave site, as well.\\r\\nSome families build altars or small shrines in their homes;[12] these sometimes feature a Christian cross, statues or pictures of the Blessed Virgin Mary, pictures of deceased relatives and other people, scores of candles, and an ofrenda. Traditionally, families spend some time around the altar, praying and telling anecdotes about the deceased. In some locations, celebrants wear shells on their clothing, so when they dance, the noise will wake up the dead; some will also dress up as the deceased.\\r\\nPublic schools at all levels build altars with ofrendas, usually omitting the religious symbols. Government offices usually have at least a small altar, as this holiday is seen as important to the Mexican heritage.\\r\\nThose with a distinctive talent for writing sometimes create short poems, called calaveras (skulls), mocking epitaphs of friends, describing interesting habits and attitudes or funny anecdotes. This custom originated in the 18th or 19th century after a newspaper published a poem narrating a dream of a cemetery in the future, \\"and all of us were dead\\", proceeding to read the tombstones. Newspapers dedicate calaveras to public figures, with cartoons of skeletons in the style of the famous calaveras of Jos Guadalupe Posada, a Mexican illustrator. Theatrical presentations of Don Juan Tenorio by Jos Zorrilla (1817ÿ1893) are also traditional on this day.\\r\\nJos Guadalupe Posada created a famous print of a figure he called La Calavera Catrina (\\"The Elegant Skull\\") as a parody of a Mexican upper-class female. Posada's striking image of a costumed female with a skeleton face has become associated with the Day of the Dead, and Catrina figures often are a prominent part of modern Day of the Dead observances.\\r\\nA common symbol of the holiday is the skull (in Spanish calavera), which celebrants represent in masks, called calacas (colloquial term for skeleton), and foods such as sugar or chocolate skulls, which are inscribed with the name of the recipient on the forehead. Sugar skulls can be given as gifts to both the living and the dead. Other holiday foods include pan de muerto, a sweet egg bread made in various shapes from plain rounds to skulls and rabbits, often decorated with white frosting to look like twisted bones.\\r\\nThe traditions and activities that take place in celebration of the Day of the Dead are not universal, often varying from town to town. For example, in the town of Ptzcuaro on the Lago de Ptzcuaro in Michoacn, the tradition is very different if the deceased is a child rather than an adult. On November 1 of the year after a child's death, the godparents set a table in the parents' home with sweets, fruits, pan de muerto, a cross, a rosary (used to ask the Virgin Mary to pray for them) and candles. This is meant to celebrate the child's life, in respect and appreciation for the parents. There is also dancing with colorful costumes, often with skull-shaped masks and devil masks in the plaza or garden of the town. At midnight on November 2, the people light candles and ride winged boats called mariposas (butterflies) to Janitzio, an island in the middle of the lake where there is a cemetery, to honor and celebrate the lives of the dead there.\\r\\nIn contrast, the town of Ocotepec, north of Cuernavaca in the State of Morelos, opens its doors to visitors in exchange for veladoras (small wax candles) to show respect for the recently deceased. In return the visitors receive tamales and atole. This is done only by the owners of the house where someone in the household has died in the previous year. Many people of the surrounding areas arrive early to eat for free and enjoy the elaborate altars set up to receive the visitors.\\r\\nIn some parts of the country (especially the cities, where in recent years other customs have been displaced) children in costumes roam the streets, knocking on people's doors for a calaverita, a small gift of candies or money; they also ask passersby for it. This relatively recent custom is similar to that of Halloween's trick-or-treating in the United States.\\r\\nSome people believe possessing Day of the Dead items can bring good luck. Many people get tattoos or have dolls of the dead to carry with them. They also clean their houses and prepare the favorite dishes of their deceased loved ones to place upon their altar or ofrenda.\\r\\nDuring Day of the Dead festivities, food is both eaten by living people and given to the spirits of their departed ancestors as ofrendas (\\"offerings\\").[14] Tamales are one of the most common dishes prepared for this day for both purposes.[15]\\r\\nPan de muerto and calaveras are associated specifically with Day of the Dead. Pan de muerto is a type of sweet roll shaped like a bun, topped with sugar, and often decorated with bone-shaped phalanges pieces.[16] Calaveras, or sugar skulls, display colorful designs to represent the vitality and individual personality of the departed.[15]\\r\\nIn addition to food, drink is also important to the tradition of Day of the Dead. Historically, the main alcoholic drink was pulque while today families will commonly drink the favorite beverage of their deceased ancestors.[15] Other drinks associated with the holiday are atole and champurrado, warm, thick, non-alcoholic masa drinks.\\r\\nJamaican iced tea is a popular herbal tea made of the flowers and leaves of the Jamaican hibiscus plant (Hibiscus sabdariffa), known as flor de Jamaica in Mexico. It is served cold and quite sweet with a lot of ice. The ruby-red beverage is called hibiscus tea in English-speaking countries and called agua de Jamaica (water of Jamaica) in Spanish.[17]\\r\\nIn Belize, Day of the Dead is practiced by people of the Yucatec Maya ethnicity. The celebration is known as Hanal Pixan which means \\"food for the souls\\" in their language. Altars are constructed and decorated with food, drinks, candies, and candles put on them.\\r\\nDia de los ?atitas (\\"Day of the Skulls\\") is a festival celebrated in La Paz, Bolivia, on May 5. In pre-Columbian times indigenous Andeans had a tradition of sharing a day with the bones of their ancestors on the third year after burial. Today families keep only the skulls for such rituals. Traditionally, the skulls of family members are kept at home to watch over the family and protect them during the year. On November 9, the family crowns the skulls with fresh flowers, sometimes also dressing them in various garments, and making offerings of cigarettes, coca leaves, alcohol, and various other items in thanks for the year's protection. The skulls are also sometimes taken to the central cemetery in La Paz for a special Mass and blessing.[18][19][20]\\r\\nThe Brazilian public holiday of Finados (Day of the Dead) is celebrated on November 2. Similar to other Day of the Dead celebrations, people go to cemeteries and churches with flowers and candles and offer prayers. The celebration is intended as a positive honoring of the dead. Memorializing the dead draws from indigenous, African and European Catholic origins.\\r\\nGuatemalan celebrations of the Day of the Dead, on November 1, are highlighted by the construction and flying of giant kites[21] in addition to the traditional visits to grave sites of ancestors. A big event also is the consumption of fiambre, which is made only for this day during the year.\\r\\nIn Ecuador the Day of the Dead is observed to some extent by all parts of society, though it is especially important to the indigenous Kichwa peoples, who make up an estimated quarter of the population. Indigena families gather together in the community cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their ancestors and lost loved ones. Ceremonial foods include colada morada, a spiced fruit porridge that derives its deep purple color from the Andean blackberry and purple maize. This is typically consumed with guagua de pan, a bread shaped like a swaddled infant, though variations include many pigsthe latter being traditional to the city of Loja. The bread, which is wheat flour-based today, but was made with masa in the pre-Columbian era, can be made savory with cheese inside or sweet with a filling of guava paste. These traditions have permeated mainstream society, as well, where food establishments add both colada morada and gaugua de pan to their menus for the season. Many non-indigenous Ecuadorians visit the graves of the deceased, cleaning and bringing flowers, or preparing the traditional foods, too.[22]\\r\\nUsually people visit the cemetery and bring flowers to decorate the graves of dead relatives. Sometimes people play music at the cemetery.[23]\\r\\nIn many American communities with Mexican residents, Day of the Dead celebrations are very similar to those held in Mexico. In some of these communities, in states such as Texas,[24] New Mexico,[25] and Arizona,[26] the celebrations tend to be mostly traditional. The All Souls Procession has been an annual Tucson, Arizona event since 1990. The event combines elements of traditional Day of the Dead celebrations with those of pagan harvest festivals. People wearing masks carry signs honoring the dead and an urn in which people can place slips of paper with prayers on them to be burned.[27] Likewise, Old Town San Diego, California annually hosts a traditional two-day celebration culminating in a candlelight procession to the historic El Campo Santo Cemetery.[28]\\r\\nIn Missoula, Montana, celebrants wearing skeleton costumes and walking on stilts, riding novelty bicycles, and traveling on skis parade through town.[29]\\r\\nThe festival also is held annually at historic Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. Sponsored by Forest Hills Educational Trust and the folkloric performance group La Pi?ata, the Day of the Dead festivities celebrate the cycle of life and death. People bring offerings of flowers, photos, mementos, and food for their departed loved ones, which they place at an elaborately and colorfully decorated altar. A program of traditional music and dance also accompanies the community event.\\r\\nThe Smithsonian Institution, in collaboration with the University of Texas at El Paso and Second Life, have created a Smithsonian Latino Virtual Museum and accompanying multimedia e-book: Da de los Muertos: Day of the Dead. The project's website contains some of the text and images which explain the origins of some of the customary core practices related to the Day of the Dead, such as the background beliefs and the offrenda (the special altar commemorating one's deceased loved one).[30] The Made For iTunes multimedia e-book version provides additional content, such as further details; additional photo galleries; pop-up profiles of influential Latino artists and cultural figures over the decades; and video clips[31] of interviews with artists who make Dia de Muertos-themed artwork, explanations and performances of Aztec and other traditional dances, an animation short that explains the customs to children, virtual poetry readings in English and Spanish.[32][33]\\r\\nSanta Ana, California is said to hold the \\"largest event in Southern California\\" honoring Da de Muertos, called the annual Noche de Altares, which began in 2002.[34] The celebration of the Day of the Dead in Santa Ana has grown to two large events with the creation of an event held at the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center for the first time on November 1, 2015.[35]\\r\\nIn other communities, interactions between Mexican traditions and American culture are resulting in celebrations in which Mexican traditions are being extended to make artistic or sometimes political statements. For example, in Los Angeles, California, the Self Help Graphics & Art Mexican-American cultural center presents an annual Day of the Dead celebration that includes both traditional and political elements, such as altars to honor the victims of the Iraq War, highlighting the high casualty rate among Latino soldiers. An updated, intercultural version of the Day of the Dead is also evolving at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.[36] There, in a mixture of Native Californian art, Mexican traditions and Hollywood hip, conventional altars are set up side-by-side with altars to Jayne Mansfield and Johnny Ramone. Colorful native dancers and music intermix with performance artists, while sly pranksters play on traditional themes.\\r\\nSimilar traditional and intercultural updating of Mexican celebrations are held in San Francisco. For example, the Galera de la Raza, SomArts Cultural Center, Mission Cultural Center, de Young Museum and altars at Garfield Square by the Marigold Project.[37] Oakland is home to Corazon Del Pueblo in the Fruitvale district. Corazon Del Pueblo has a shop offering handcrafted Mexican gifts and a museum devoted to Day of the Dead artifacts. Also, the Fruitvale district in Oakland serves as the hub of the Dia de Muertos annual festival which occurs the last weekend of October. Here, a mix of several Mexican traditions come together with traditional Aztec dancers, regional Mexican music, and other Mexican artisans to celebrate the day.[38]\\r\\nThe Catholic traditions were initiated with the arrival of the Portuguese in 1510. The Almacho Dis (Souls Day) is commemorated on Nov 2, following all Saints Day (Nov. 1). On this day, the forgotten souls are remembered and spiritual charity is done though prayer for the deceased family and ancestral souls. Charity is practiced also by offering food for the poor called beggars lunch (bikareanchem jevonn) where the poor are invited for lunch, from the village and treated with dignity and respect. The invited down trodden are served as guest and usually commences with prayers for the deceased souls. Following mass on all souls day, the deceased visit the graveyard of the deceased souls and pray and also decorate their graves.[39]\\r\\nWhile ancestor veneration is an ancient part of Filipino culture, the modern observance is believed to have been imported from Mexico when the islands (as part of the Spanish East Indies) were governed from Mexico City as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.[citation needed] During the holiday (observed every November 1), Filipinos customarily visit family tombs and other graves, which they repair and clean. Entire families spend a night or two at their loved ones' tombs, passing time with card games, eating, drinking, singing and dancing. Prayers such as the rosary are often said for the deceased, who are normally offered candles, flowers, food, and even liquor. Some Catholic Chinese Filipino families additionally offer joss sticks to the dead, and observe customs otherwise associated with the Hungry Ghost Festival.\\r\\nIn Christian Europe, Roman Catholic customs absorbed pagan traditions. All Saints Day and All Souls Day became the autumnal celebration of the dead. Over many centuries, rites which had occurred in cultivated fields, where the souls of the dead were thought to leave after the harvest, to cemeteries.\\r\\nIn many countries with a Roman Catholic heritage, All Saints Day and All Souls Day have evolved traditions in which people take the day off work, go to cemeteries with candles and flowers, and give presents to children, usually sweets and toys.[10][40] In Portugal and Spain ofrendas (\\"offerings\\") are made on this day. In Spain, the play Don Juan Tenorio is traditionally performed.[10] In Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain, people bring flowers (typically chrysanthemums in France and northern Europe) to the graves of dead relatives and say prayers over the dead.\\r\\nIn Eastern Europe holiday is called Dziady and also has pagan origins. In Belarus the ancient tradition involved cooking ritual dishes for supper. Part of each dish was put into a separate plate and left overnight for the dead ancestors. Public meetings are often organized on this day to commemorate the victims of Soviet political repressions.\\r\\nAs part of a promotion by the Mexican embassy in Prague, Czech Republic, since the late 20th century, some local citizens join in a Mexican-style Day of the Dead. A theatre group produces events featuring masks, candles, and sugar skulls.[41]\\r\\nMexican-style Day of the Dead celebrations occur in major cities in Australia, Fiji, and Indonesia. Additionally, prominent celebrations are held in Wellington, New Zealand, complete with altars celebrating the deceased with flowers and gifts.[42]\\r\\nMany other cultures around the world have similar traditions of a day set aside to visit the graves of deceased family members. Often included in these traditions are celebrations, food, and beverages, in addition to prayers and remembrances of the departed.\\r\\nIn some African cultures, visits to ancestors' graves, the leaving of food and gifts, and the asking of protection from them serve as important parts of traditional rituals. One such ritual is held just before the start of the hunting season.[43]\\r\\nThe Qingming Festival (simplified Chinese: ]u; traditional Chinese: ]?; pinyin: qؐng mng ji) is a traditional Chinese festival usually occurring around April 5 of the Gregorian calendar. Along with Double Ninth Festival on the 9th day of the 9th month in the Chinese calendar, it is a time to tend to the graves of departed ones. In addition, in the Chinese tradition, the seventh month in the Chinese calendar is called the Ghost Month (廈), in which ghosts and spirits come out from the underworld to visit earth.\\r\\nThe Bon Festival (O-bon (), or only Bon ()), is a Japanese Buddhist holiday held in August to honor the spirits of departed ancestors. It is derived in part from the Chinese observance of the Ghost Month, and was affixed to the solar calendar along with other traditional Japanese holidays.\\r\\nIn Korea, Chuseok (??, ߛ; also called Hangawi) is a major traditional holiday. People go where the spirits of their ancestors are enshrined, and perform ancestral worship rituals early in the morning. They visit the tombs of immediate ancestors to trim plants, clean the area around the tomb, and offer food, drink, and crops to their ancestors.\\r\\nDuring the Nepalese holiday of Gai Jatra (\\"Cow Pilgrimage\\"), every family who has lost a member during the previous year creates a tai out of bamboo branches, cloth, and paper decorations, in which are placed portraits of the deceased. As a cow traditionally leads the spirits of the dead into the afterlife, an actual or symbolic cow is used depending on local custom. The festival is also a time to dress up in a costume reminiscent of the western Halloween, with popular subjects including political commentary and satire.[44]\\r\\nDisneyland Resorts' annual \\"Halloween Time\\" celebrates the art and traditions of Dias de los Muertos located at Frontierland.[45][46][47]\\r\\nThe 1998 Grim Fandango video game features Mexican Day of the Dead iconography with Aztec and Egyptian influences.[48]\\r\\nThe 2014 The Book of Life film follows a bullfighter who, on the Day of the Dead, embarks on an afterlife adventure.[49]\\r\\nIn the 2015 James Bond film, Spectre, the opening sequence featured a Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City. At the time, no such parade took place in Mexico City; one year later, due to the interest in the film and the government desire to promote the pre-Hispanic Mexican culture, the federal and local authorities decided to organize an actual \\"Da de Muertos\\" parade through Paseo de la Reforma and Centro Historico on October 29, 2016, which was attended by 250,000 people.[50][51][52]\\r\\nThe 2016 Elena of Avalor season one episode \\"A Night to Remember\\" focused on Dias de los Muertos.[53]\\r\\nThe 2017 Pixar film Coco features the Dias de los Muertos holiday as a major element in its plot.[54]","input":"Where did el dia de los muertos originate?"},{"output":"365.25","context":"The Julian calendar, proposed by Julius Caesar in 46?BC (708 AUC), was a reform of the Roman calendar.[1] It took effect on 1 January 45?BC (AUC 709), by edict. It was the predominant calendar in the Roman world, most of Europe, and in European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere, until it was refined and gradually replaced by the Gregorian calendar, promulgated in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. The Julian calendar gains against the mean tropical year at the rate of one day in 128 years. For the Gregorian the figure is one day in 3,030 years.[2] The difference in the average length of the year between Julian (365.25 days) and Gregorian (365.2425 days) is 0.002%.\\r\\nThe Julian calendar has a regular year of 365 days divided into 12 months, as listed in the table below. A leap day is added to February every four years. The Julian year is, therefore, on average 365.25 days long. It was intended to approximate the tropical (solar) year. Although Greek astronomers had known, at least since Hipparchus, a century before the Julian reform, that the tropical year was slightly shorter than 365.25 days, the calendar did not compensate for this difference. As a result, the calendar year gains about three days every four centuries compared to observed equinox times and the seasons. This discrepancy was corrected by the Gregorian reform of 1582. The Gregorian calendar has the same months and month lengths as the Julian calendar, but, in the Gregorian calendar, years evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years, except that years evenly divisible by 400 remain leap years.[3] Consequentlysince 16 February Julian/1 March 1900 Gregorian and until 15 February Julian/28 February 2100 Gregorianthe Julian calendar is currently 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar.\\r\\nThe Julian calendar has been replaced as the civil calendar by the Gregorian calendar in almost all countries which formerly used it, although it continued to be the civil calendar of some countries into the 20th century.[4] Egypt converted on 20 December 1874/1 January 1875. Turkey switched (for fiscal purposes) on 16 February/1 March 1917. Russia changed on 1/14 February 1918.[5] Greece made the change for civil purposes on 16 February/1 March 1923, but the national day (25 March), which was a religious holiday, was to remain on the old calendar. Most Christian denominations in the west and areas evangelised by western churches have also replaced the Julian calendar with the Gregorian as the basis for their liturgical calendars. However, most branches of the Eastern Orthodox Church still use the Julian calendar for calculating the date of Easter, upon which the timing of all the other moveable feasts depends. Some Orthodox churches have adopted the Revised Julian calendar for the observance of fixed feasts, while other Orthodox churches retain the Julian calendar for all purposes.[6] The Julian calendar is still used by the Berbers of the Maghreb in the form of the Berber calendar,[7] and on Mount Athos. In the form of the Alexandrian calendar, it is the basis for the Ethiopian calendar, which is the civil calendar of Ethiopia.\\r\\nDuring the changeover between calendars and for some time afterwards, dual dating was used in documents and gave the date according to both systems. In contemporary as well as modern texts that describe events during the period of change, it is customary to clarify to which calendar a given date refers by using an O.S. or N.S. suffix (denoting Old Style, Julian or New Style, Gregorian).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ordinary year in the previous Roman calendar consisted of 12 months, for a total of 355 days. In addition, a 27- or 28-day intercalary month, the Mensis Intercalaris, was sometimes inserted between February and March. This intercalary month was formed by inserting 22 or 23 days after the first 23 days of February; the last five days of February, which counted down toward the start of March, became the last five days of Intercalaris. The net effect was to add 22 or 23 days to the year, forming an intercalary year of 377 or 378 days.[10] Some say the mensis intercalaris always had 27 days and began on either the first or the second day after the Terminalia (23 February).[11]\\r\\nAccording to the later writers Censorinus and Macrobius, the ideal intercalary cycle consisted of ordinary years of 355 days alternating with intercalary years, alternately 377 and 378 days long. In this system, the average Roman year would have had ?366?1?4 days over four years, giving it an average drift of one day per year relative to any solstice or equinox. Macrobius describes a further refinement whereby, in one 8-year period within a 24-year cycle, there were only three intercalary years, each of 377 days (thus 11 intercalary years out of 24). This refinement averages the length of the year to 365.25 days over 24 years.\\r\\nIn practice, intercalations did not occur systematically according to any of these ideal systems, but were determined by the pontifices. So far as can be determined from the historical evidence, they were much less regular than these ideal schemes suggest. They usually occurred every second or third year, but were sometimes omitted for much longer, and occasionally occurred in two consecutive years.\\r\\nIf managed correctly this system could have allowed the Roman year to stay roughly aligned to a tropical year. However, since the pontifices were often politicians, and because a Roman magistrate's term of office corresponded with a calendar year, this power was prone to abuse: a pontifex could lengthen a year in which he or one of his political allies was in office, or refuse to lengthen one in which his opponents were in power.[12]\\r\\nIf too many intercalations were omitted, as happened after the Second Punic War and during the Civil Wars, the calendar would drift out of alignment with the tropical year. Moreover, because intercalations were often determined quite late, the average Roman citizen often did not know the date, particularly if he were some distance from the city. For these reasons, the last years of the pre-Julian calendar were later known as \\"years of confusion\\". The problems became particularly acute during the years of Julius Caesar's pontificate before the reform, 63ÿ46?BC, when there were only five intercalary months (instead of eight), none of which were during the five Roman years before 46?BC.\\r\\nCaesar's reform was intended to solve this problem permanently, by creating a calendar that remained aligned to the sun without any human intervention. This proved useful very soon after the new calendar came into effect. Varro used it in 37?BC to fix calendar dates for the start of the four seasons, which would have been impossible only 8 years earlier.[13] A century later, when Pliny dated the winter solstice to 25 December because the sun entered the 8th degree of Capricorn on that date,[14] this stability had become an ordinary fact of life.\\r\\nAlthough the approximation of ?365?1?4 days for the tropical year had been known for a long time[15] ancient solar calendars had used less precise periods, resulting in gradual misalignment of the calendar with the seasons.\\r\\nThe octaeteris, a cycle of 8 lunar years popularised by Cleostratus (and also commonly attributed to Eudoxus) which was used in some early Greek calendars, notably in Athens, is 1.53 days longer than eight Julian years. The length of nineteen years in the cycle of Meton was 6,940 days, six hours longer than the mean Julian year. The mean Julian year was the basis of the 76-year cycle devised by Callippus (a student under Eudoxus) to improve the Metonic cycle.\\r\\nIn Persia (Iran) after the reform in the Persian calendar by introduction of the Persian Zoroastrian (i. e. Young Avestan) calendar in 503?BC and afterwards, the first day of the year (1 Farvardin=Nowruz) slipped against the vernal equinox at the rate of approximately one day every four years.[16][17]\\r\\nLikewise in the Egyptian calendar, a fixed year of 365 days was in use, drifting by one day against the sun in four years. An unsuccessful attempt to add an extra day every fourth year was made in 238?BC (Decree of Canopus). Caesar probably experienced this \\"wandering\\" or \\"vague\\" calendar in that country. He landed in the Nile delta in October 48?BC and soon became embroiled in the Ptolemaic dynastic war, especially after Cleopatra managed to be \\"introduced\\" to him in Alexandria.\\r\\nCaesar imposed a peace, and a banquet was held to celebrate the event.[18] Lucan depicted Caesar talking to a wise man called Acoreus during the feast, stating his intention to create a calendar more perfect than that of Eudoxus[18] (Eudoxus was popularly credited with having determined the length of the year to be ?365?1?4 days).[19] But the war soon resumed and Caesar was attacked by the Egyptian army for several months until he achieved victory. He then enjoyed a long cruise on the Nile with Cleopatra before leaving the country in June 47?BC.[20]\\r\\nCaesar returned to Rome in 46?BC and, according to Plutarch, called in the best philosophers and mathematicians of his time to solve the problem of the calendar.[21] Pliny says that Caesar was aided in his reform by the astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria[22] who is generally considered the principal designer of the reform. Sosigenes may also have been the author of the astronomical almanac published by Caesar to facilitate the reform.[23] Eventually, it was decided to establish a calendar that would be a combination between the old Roman months, the fixed length of the Egyptian calendar, and the ?365?1?4 days of the Greek astronomy. According to Macrobius, Caesar was assisted in this by a certain Marcus Flavius.[24]\\r\\nThe first step of the reform was to realign the start of the calendar year (1 January) to the tropical year by making 46?BC (708 AUC) 445 days long, compensating for the intercalations which had been missed during Caesar's pontificate. This year had already been extended from 355 to 378 days by the insertion of a regular intercalary month in February. When Caesar decreed the reform, probably shortly after his return from the African campaign in late Quintilis (July), he added 67 more days by inserting two extraordinary intercalary months between November and December.[25]\\r\\nThese months are called Intercalaris Prior and Intercalaris Posterior in letters of Cicero written at the time; there is no basis for the statement sometimes seen that they were called \\"Undecimber\\" and \\"Duodecimber\\".[26] Their individual lengths are unknown, as is the position of the Nones and Ides within them.[27]\\r\\nBecause 46?BC was the last of a series of irregular years, this extra-long year was, and is, referred to as the \\"last year of confusion\\". The new calendar began operation after the realignment had been completed, in 45?BC.[28]\\r\\nThe Julian months were formed by adding ten days to a regular pre-Julian Roman year of 355 days, creating a regular Julian year of 365 days. Two extra days were added to January, Sextilis (August) and December, and one extra day was added to April, June, September and November. February was not changed in ordinary years, and so continued to be the traditional 28 days. Thus, the ordinary (i.e., non leap year) lengths of all of the months were set by the Julian calendar to the same values they still hold today. (See Sacrobosco's theory on month lengths below for stories purporting otherwise.)\\r\\nThe Julian reform did not change the method used to account days of the month in the pre-Julian calendar, based on the Kalends, Nones and Ides, nor did it change the positions of these three dates within the months. Macrobius states that the extra days were added immediately before the last day of each month to avoid disturbing the position of the established religious ceremonies relative to the Nones and Ides of the month.[29] However, since Roman dates after the Ides of the month counted down toward the start of the next month, the extra days had the effect of raising the initial value of the count of the day following the Ides in the lengthened months. Thus, in January, Sextilis and December the 14th day of the month became a.d. XIX Kal. instead of a.d. XVII Kal., while in April, June, September and November it became a.d. XVIII Kal.\\r\\nRomans of the time born after the Ides of a month responded differently to the effect of this change on their birthdays. Mark Antony kept his birthday on 14 January, which changed its date from a.d. XVII Kal. Feb to a.d. XIX Kal. Feb, a date that had previously not existed. Livia kept the date of her birthday unchanged at a.d. III Kal. Feb., which moved it from 28 to 30 January, a day that had previously not existed. Augustus kept his on 23 September, but both the old date (a.d. VIII Kal. Oct.) and the new (a.d. IX Kal. Oct.) were celebrated in some places.\\r\\nThe inserted days were all initially characterised as dies fasti (F ÿ see Roman calendar).[30] The character of a few festival days was changed. In the early Julio-Claudian period a large number of festivals were decreed to celebrate events of dynastic importance, which caused the character of the associated dates to be changed to NP. However, this practice was discontinued around the reign of Claudius, and the practice of characterising days fell into disuse around the end of the first century AD: the Antonine jurist Gaius speaks of dies nefasti as a thing of the past.[31]\\r\\nThe old intercalary month was abolished. The new leap day was dated as ante diem bis sextum Kalendas Martias ('the sixth doubled before the Kalends of March'), usually abbreviated as a.d. bis VI Kal. Mart.; hence it is called in English the bissextile day. The year in which it occurred was termed annus bissextus, in English the bissextile year.\\r\\nThere is debate about the exact position of the bissextile day in the early Julian calendar. The earliest direct evidence is a statement of the 2nd century jurist Celsus, who states that there were two halves of a 48-hour day, and that the intercalated day was the \\"posterior\\" half. An inscription from AD 168 states that a.d. V Kal. Mart. was the day after the bissextile day. The 19th century chronologist Ideler argued that Celsus used the term \\"posterior\\" in a technical fashion to refer to the earlier of the two days, which requires the inscription to refer to the whole 48-hour day as the bissextile. Some later historians share this view. Others, following Mommsen, take the view that Celsus was using the ordinary Latin (and English) meaning of \\"posterior\\". A third view is that neither half of the 48-hour \\"bis sextum\\" was originally formally designated as intercalated, but that the need to do so arose as the concept of a 48-hour day became obsolete.[32]\\r\\nThere is no doubt that the bissextile day eventually became the earlier of the two days for most purposes. In 238 Censorinus stated that it was inserted after the Terminalia (23 February) and was followed by the last five days of February, i.e., a.d. VI, V, IV, III and prid. Kal. Mart. (which would be 24 to 28 February in a common year and the 25th to 29th in a leap year). Hence he regarded the bissextum as the first half of the doubled day. All later writers, including Macrobius about 430, Bede in 725, and other medieval computists (calculators of Easter) followed this rule, as does the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. However, Celsus' definition continued to be used for legal purposes. It was incorporated into Justinian's Digest,[33] and in the English statute De anno et die bissextili of 1236, which was not formally repealed until 1879.\\r\\nThe effect of the bissextile day on the nundinal cycle is not discussed in the sources. According to Dio Cassius, a leap day was inserted in 41?BC to ensure that the first market day of 40?BC did not fall on 1 January, which implies that the old 8-day cycle was not immediately affected by the Julian reform. However, he also reports that in AD 44, and on some previous occasions, the market day was changed to avoid a conflict with a religious festival. This may indicate that a single nundinal letter was assigned to both halves of the 48-hour bissextile day by this time, so that the Regifugium and the market day might fall on the same date but on different days. In any case, the 8-day nundinal cycle began to be displaced by the 7-day week in the first century AD, and dominical letters began to appear alongside nundinal letters in the fasti.[34]\\r\\nDuring the late Middle Ages days in the month came to be numbered in consecutive day order. Consequently, the leap day was considered to be the last day in February in leap years, i.e., 29 February, which is its current position.\\r\\nThe Julian reform set the lengths of the months to their modern values. However, a 13th-century scholar, Sacrobosco, proposed a different explanation for the lengths of Julian months[35] which is still widely repeated but is certainly wrong.\\r\\nAccording to Sacrobosco, the month lengths for ordinary years in the Roman Republican calendar, from January to December, were:\\r\\nSacrobosco then thought that Julius Caesar added one day to every month except February, a total of 11 more days to regular months, giving the ordinary Julian year of 365 days. A single leap day could now be added to this extra short February:\\r\\nHe then said Augustus changed this, by taking one day from February to add it to Sextilis, and then modifying the alternation of the following months, to:\\r\\nso that the length of Augustus (August) would not be shorter than (and therefore inferior to) the length of Iulius (July), giving us the irregular month lengths which are still in use.\\r\\nThere is abundant evidence disproving this theory. First, a wall painting of a Roman calendar predating the Julian reform has survived,[36] which confirms the literary accounts that the months were already irregular before Julius Caesar reformed them, with an ordinary year of 355 days, not 354, with month lengths arranged as:\\r\\nAlso, the Julian reform did not change the dates of the Nones and Ides. In particular, the Ides were late (on the 15th rather than 13th) in March, May, July and October, showing that these months always had 31 days in the Roman calendar,[37] whereas Sacrobosco's theory requires that March, May and July were originally 30 days long and that the length of October was changed from 29 to 30 days by Caesar and to 31 days by Augustus. Further, Sacrobosco's theory is explicitly contradicted by the 3rd and 5th century authors Censorinus[38] and Macrobius,[39] and it is inconsistent with seasonal lengths given by Varro, writing in 37?BC,[13] before Sextilis was renamed for Augustus in 8?BC, with the 31-day Sextilis given by an Egyptian papyrus from 24?BC,[40] and with the 28-day February shown in the Fasti Caeretani, which is dated before 12?BC.[41]\\r\\nCaesar's reform only applied to the Roman calendar. However, in the following decades many of the local civic and provincial calendars of the empire and neighbouring client kingdoms were aligned to the Julian calendar by transforming them into calendars with years of 365 days with an extra day intercalated every four years.[42] The reformed calendars typically retained many features of the unreformed calendars. In many cases, the New Year was not on 1 January, the leap day was not on the bissextile day, the old month names were retained, the lengths of the reformed months did not match the lengths of Julian months, and, even if they did, their first days did not match the first day of the corresponding Julian month. Nevertheless, since the reformed calendars had fixed relationships to each other and to the Julian calendar, the process of converting dates between them became quite straightforward, through the use of conversion tables known as hemerologia.[43] Several of the reformed calendars are only known through surviving hemerologia.\\r\\nThe three most important of these calendars are the Alexandrian calendar, the Asian calendar and the Syro-Macedonian calendar. Other reformed calendars are known from Cappadocia, Cyprus and the cities of Syria and Palestine. Most reformed calendars were adopted under Augustus, though the calendar of Nabatea was reformed after the kingdom became the Roman province of Arabia in AD 106. There is no evidence that local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar in the western empire. Unreformed calendars continued to be used in Gaul, Greece, Macedon, the Balkans and parts of Palestine, most notably in Judea.\\r\\nThe Alexandrian calendar adapted the Egyptian calendar by adding a 6th epagomenal day as the last day of the year in every fourth year, falling on 29 August preceding a Julian bissextile day. It was otherwise identical to the Egyptian calendar. The first leap day was in 22?BC, and they occurred every four years from the beginning, even though Roman leap days occurred every three years at this time (see Leap year error). This calendar influenced the structure of several other reformed calendars, such as those of the cities of Gaza and Ascalon in Palestine, Salamis in Cyprus, and the province of Arabia. It was adopted by the Coptic church and remains in use both as the liturgical calendar of the Coptic church and as the civil calendar of Ethiopia.\\r\\nThe Asian calendar was an adaptation of the Macedonian calendar used in the province of Asia and, with minor variations, in nearby cities and provinces. It is known in detail through the survival of decrees promulgating it issued in 8 BC by the proconsul Paullus Fabius Maximus. It renamed the first month Dios as Kaisar, and arranged the months such that each month started on the ninth day before the kalends of the corresponding Roman month; thus the year began on 23 September, Augustus' birthday. Since Greek months typically had 29 or 30 days, the extra day of 31 day months was named Sebastethe emperor's dayand was the first day of these months. The leap day was a second Sebaste day in the month of Xandikos, i.e., 24 February. This calendar remained in use at least until the middle of the fifth century AD.\\r\\nThe Syro-Macedonian calendar was an adaptation of the Macedonian calendar used in Antioch and other parts of Syria. The months were exactly aligned to the Julian calendar, but they retained their Macedonian names and the year began in Dios = November until the fifth century, when the start of the year was moved to Gorpiaios = September.\\r\\nThese reformed calendars generally remained in use until the fifth or sixth century. Around that time most of them were replaced as civil calendars by the Julian calendar, but with a year starting in September to reflect the year of the indiction cycle.\\r\\nThe Julian calendar spread beyond the borders of the Roman Empire through its use as the Christian liturgical calendar. When a people or a country was converted to Christianity, they generally also adopted the Christian calendar of the church responsible for conversion. Thus, Christian Nubia and Ethiopia adopted the Alexandrian calendar, while Christian Europe adopted the Julian calendar, in either the Catholic or Orthodox variant. Starting in the 16th century, European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere likewise inherited the Julian calendar of the mother country, until they adopted the Gregorian reform. The last country to adopt the Julian calendar was the Ottoman Empire, which used it for financial purposes for some time under the name Rumi calendar and dropped the \\"escape years\\" which tied it to Muslim chronology in 1840.\\r\\nAlthough the new calendar was much simpler than the pre-Julian calendar, the pontifices initially added a leap day every three years, instead of every four. There are accounts of this in Solinus,[44] Pliny,[45] Ammianus,[46] Suetonius,[47] and Censorinus.[48]\\r\\nMacrobius[49] gives the following account of the introduction of the Julian calendar:\\r\\n\\"Caesars regulation of the civil year to accord with his revised measurement was proclaimed publicly by edict, and the arrangement might have continued to stand had not the correction itself of the calendar led the priests to introduce a new error of their own; for they proceeded to insert the intercalary day, which represented the four quarter-days, at the beginning of each fourth year instead of at its end, although the intercalation ought to have been made at the end of each fourth year and before the beginning of the fifth.\\r\\n\\"This error continued for thirty-six years by which time twelve intercalary days had been inserted instead of the number actually due, namely nine. But when this error was at length recognised, it too was corrected, by an order of Augustus, that twelve years should be allowed to pass without an intercalary day, since the sequence of twelve such years would account for the three days which, in the course of thirty-six years, had been introduced by the premature actions of the priests.\\"\\r\\nSo, according to Macrobius,\\r\\nSome people have had different ideas as to how the leap years went. The above scheme is that of Scaliger in the table below. He established that the Augustan reform was instituted in 8?BC. The table shows for each reconstruction the implied proleptic Julian date for the first day of Caesar's reformed calendar (Kal. Ian. AUC 709) and the first Julian date on which the Roman calendar date matches the Julian calendar after the completion of Augustus' reform.\\r\\nAlexander Jones claims that the correct Julian calendar was in use in Egypt in 24?BC,[40] implying that the first day of the reform in both Egypt and Rome, 1 January 45 BC, was the Julian date 1?January if 45?BC was a leap year and 2?January if it was not. This necessitates fourteen leap days up to and including AD?8 if 45?BC was a leap year and thirteen if it was not.\\r\\nPierre Brind'Amour[52] argued that \\"only one day was intercalated between 1/1/45 and 1/1/40 (disregarding a momentary 'fiddling' in December of 41[53] to avoid the nundinum falling on Kal. Ian.\\"[54]\\r\\nIn 1999 a papyrus was discovered which gives the dates of astronomical phenomena in 24?BC in both the Egyptian and Roman calendars. From 30 August 26 BC (Julian) Egypt had two calendars: the old Egyptian in which every year had 365 days and the new Alexandrian in which every fourth year had 366 days. Up to 28 August 22 BC (Julian) the date in both calendars was the same. The dates in the Alexandrian and Julian calendars are in one-to-one correspondence except for the period from 29 August in the year preceding a Julian leap year to the following 24 February.[63] From a comparison of the astronomical data with the Egyptian and Roman dates Alexander Jones[40] concluded that the Egyptian astronomers (as opposed to travellers from Rome) used the correct Julian calendar.\\r\\nAn inscription has been discovered[64] which orders a new calendar to be used in Asia to replace the previous Greek lunar calendar. According to one translation[65]\\r\\n\\"Intercalation shall commence on the day after 14 Peritius [a.d. IX Kal. Feb, which would have been 15 Peritius] as it is currently constituted in the third year following promulgation of the decree. Xanthicus shall have 32 days in this intercalary year.\\"\\r\\nThis is historically correct. It was decreed by the proconsul that the first day of the year in the new calendar shall be Augustus' birthday, a.d. IX Kal. Oct. Every month begins on the ninth day before the kalends. The date of introduction, the day after 14 Peritius, was 1 Dystrus, the next month. The month after that was Xanthicus. Thus Xanthicus began on a.d. IX Kal. Mart., and normally contained 31 days. In leap year, however, it contained an extra \\"Sebaste day\\", the Roman leap day, and thus had 32 days. From the lunar nature of the old calendar we can fix the starting date of the new one as 24?January, a.d. IX Kal. Feb 5 BC in the Julian calendar, which was a leap year. Thus from inception the dates of the reformed Asian calendar are in one-to-one correspondence with the Julian.\\r\\nAnother translation of this inscription[66] is\\r\\n\\"Intercalation shall commence on the day after the fourteenth day in the current month of Peritius [a.d. IX Kal. Feb], occurring every third year. Xanthicus shall have 32 days in this intercalary year.\\"\\r\\nThis would move the starting date back three years to 8?BC, and from the lunar synchronism back to 26 January (Julian). But since the corresponding Roman date in the inscription is 24 January, this must be according to the incorrect calendar which in 8?BC Augustus had ordered to be corrected by the omission of leap days. As the authors of the previous paper point out, with the correct four-year cycle being used in Egypt and the three-year cycle abolished in Rome it is unlikely that Augustus would have ordered the three-year cycle to be introduced in Asia.\\r\\nThe Julian reform did not immediately cause the names of any months to be changed. The old intercalary month was abolished and replaced with a single intercalary day at the same point (i.e., five days before the end of February). January continued to be the first month of the year.\\r\\nThe Romans later renamed months after Julius Caesar and Augustus, renaming Quintilis as \\"Iulius\\" (July)[8] in 44?BC and Sextilis as \\"Augustus\\" (August) in 8?BC. Quintilis was renamed to honour Caesar because it was the month of his birth.[67] According to a senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honour Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, occurred in that month.[68]\\r\\nOther months were renamed by other emperors, but apparently none of the later changes survived their deaths. In AD 37, Caligula renamed September as \\"Germanicus\\" after his father;[69] in AD 65, Nero renamed April as \\"Neroneus\\", May as \\"Claudius\\" and June as \\"Germanicus\\";[70] and in AD 84 Domitian renamed September as \\"Germanicus\\" and October as \\"Domitianus\\".[71] Commodus was unique in renaming all twelve months after his own adopted names (January to December): \\"Amazonius\\", \\"Invictus\\", \\"Felix\\", \\"Pius\\", \\"Lucius\\", \\"Aelius\\", \\"Aurelius\\", \\"Commodus\\", \\"Augustus\\", \\"Herculeus\\", \\"Romanus\\", and \\"Exsuperatorius\\".[72] The emperor Tacitus is said to have ordered that September, the month of his birth and accession, be renamed after him, but the story is doubtful since he did not become emperor before November 275.[73] Similar honorific month names were implemented in many of the provincial calendars that were aligned to the Julian calendar.[74]\\r\\nOther name changes were proposed but were never implemented. Tiberius rejected a senatorial proposal to rename September as \\"Tiberius\\" and October as \\"Livius\\", after his mother Livia.[75] Antoninus Pius rejected a senatorial decree renaming September as \\"Antoninus\\" and November as \\"Faustina\\", after his empress.[76]\\r\\nMuch more lasting than the ephemeral month names of the post-Augustan Roman emperors were the Old High German names introduced by Charlemagne. According to his biographer, Charlemagne renamed all of the months agriculturally into German.[77] These names were used until the 15th century, over 700 years after his rule, and continued, with some modifications, to see some use as \\"traditional\\" month names until the late 18th century. The names (January to December) were: Wintarmanoth (\\"winter month\\"), Hornung,[78] Lentzinmanoth (\\"spring month\\", \\"Lent month\\"), Ostarmanoth (\\"Easter month\\"), Wonnemanoth (\\"joy-month\\", a corruption of Winnimanoth \\"pasture-month\\"), Brachmanoth (\\"fallow-month\\"), Heuuimanoth (\\"hay month\\"), Aranmanoth (\\"reaping month\\"), Witumanoth (\\"wood month\\"), Windumemanoth (\\"vintage month\\"), Herbistmanoth (\\"harvest month\\"), and Heilagmanoth (\\"holy month\\").\\r\\nThe calendar month names used in western and northern Europe, in Byzantium, and by the Berbers, were derived from the Latin names. However, in eastern Europe older seasonal month names continued to be used into the 19th century, and in some cases are still in use, in many languages, including: Belarusian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Finnish, Georgian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Polish, Romanian, Slovene, Ukrainian. When the Ottoman Empire adopted the Julian calendar, in the form of the Rumi calendar, the month names reflected Ottoman tradition.\\r\\nThe principal method used by the Romans to identify a year for dating purposes was to name it after the two consuls who took office in it, the eponymous period in question being the consular year. Beginning in 153?BC, consuls began to take office on 1 January, thus synchronizing the commencement of the consular and calendar years. The calendar year has begun in January and ended in December since about 450?BC according to Ovid or since about 713?BC according to Macrobius and Plutarch (see Roman calendar). Julius Caesar did not change the beginning of either the consular year or the calendar year. In addition to consular years, the Romans sometimes used the regnal year of the emperor, and by the late 4th century documents were also being dated according to the 15-year cycle of the indiction. In 537, Justinian required that henceforth the date must include the name of the emperor and his regnal year, in addition to the indiction and the consul, while also allowing the use of local eras.\\r\\nIn 309 and 310, and from time to time thereafter, no consuls were appointed.[79] When this happened, the consular date was given a count of years since the last consul (so-called \\"post-consular\\" dating). After 541, only the reigning emperor held the consulate, typically for only one year in his reign, and so post-consular dating became the norm. Similar post-consular dates were also known in the west in the early 6th century. The system of consular dating, long obsolete, was formally abolished in the law code of Leo VI, issued in 888.\\r\\nOnly rarely did the Romans number the year from the founding of the city (of Rome), ab urbe condita (AUC). This method was used by Roman historians to determine the number of years from one event to another, not to date a year. Different historians had several different dates for the founding. The Fasti Capitolini, an inscription containing an official list of the consuls which was published by Augustus, used an epoch of 752?BC. The epoch used by Varro, 753?BC, has been adopted by modern historians. Indeed, Renaissance editors often added it to the manuscripts that they published, giving the false impression that the Romans numbered their years. Most modern historians tacitly assume that it began on the day the consuls took office, and ancient documents such as the Fasti Capitolini which use other AUC systems do so in the same way. However, Censorinus, writing in the 3rd century AD, states that, in his time, the AUC year began with the Parilia, celebrated on 21 April, which was regarded as the actual anniversary of the foundation of Rome.[80]\\r\\nMany local eras, such as the Era of Actium and the Spanish Era, were adopted for the Julian calendar or its local equivalent in the provinces and cities of the Roman Empire. Some of these were used for a considerable time.[81] Perhaps the best known is the Era of Martyrs, sometimes also called Anno Diocletiani (after Diocletian), which was associated with the Alexandrian calendar and often used by the Alexandrian Christians to number their Easters during the 4th and 5th centuries, and continues to be used by the Coptic and Ethiopian churches.\\r\\nIn the eastern Mediterranean, the efforts of Christian chronographers such as Annianus of Alexandria to date the Biblical creation of the world led to the introduction of Anno Mundi eras based on this event.[82] The most important of these was the Etos Kosmou, used throughout the Byzantine world from the 10th century and in Russia until 1700. In the west, the kingdoms succeeding the empire initially used indictions and regnal years, alone or in combination. The chronicler Prosper of Aquitaine, in the fifth century, used an era dated from the Passion of Christ, but this era was not widely adopted. Dionysius Exiguus proposed the system of Anno Domini in 525. This era gradually spread through the western Christian world, once the system was adopted by Bede.\\r\\nThe Julian calendar was also used in some Muslim countries. The Rumi calendar, the Julian calendar used in the later years of the Ottoman Empire, adopted an era derived from the lunar AH year equivalent to AD 1840, i.e., the effective Rumi epoch was AD 585. In recent years, some users of the Berber calendar have adopted an era starting in 950?BC, the approximate date that the Libyan pharaoh Sheshonq I came to power in Egypt.\\r\\nThe Roman calendar began the year on 1 January, and this remained the start of the year after the Julian reform. However, even after local calendars were aligned to the Julian calendar, they started the new year on different dates. The Alexandrian calendar in Egypt started on 29 August (30 August after an Alexandrian leap year). Several local provincial calendars were aligned to start on the birthday of Augustus, 23 September. The indiction caused the Byzantine year, which used the Julian calendar, to begin on 1 September; this date is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church for the beginning of the liturgical year. When the Julian calendar was adopted in AD 988 by Vladimir I of Kiev, the year was numbered Anno Mundi 6496, beginning on 1 March, six months after the start of the Byzantine Anno Mundi year with the same number. In 1492 (AM 7000), Ivan III, according to church tradition, realigned the start of the year to 1 September, so that AM 7000 only lasted for six months in Russia, from 1 March to 31 August 1492.[83]\\r\\nDuring the Middle Ages 1 January retained the name New Year's Day (or an equivalent name) in all western European countries (affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church), since the medieval calendar continued to display the months from January to December (in twelve columns containing 28 to 31 days each), just as the Romans had. However, most of those countries began their numbered year on 25 December (the Nativity of Jesus), 25 March (the Incarnation of Jesus), or even Easter, as in France (see the Liturgical year article for more details).\\r\\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, the year most commonly began on 25 December, which, as (approximately) the winter solstice, had marked the start of the year in pagan times, though 25 March (the equinox) is occasionally documented in the 11th century. Sometimes the start of the year was reckoned as 24 September, the start of the so-called \\"western indiction\\" introduced by Bede.[84] These practices changed after the Norman conquest. From 1087 to 1155 the English year began on 1 January, and from 1155 to 1751 began on 25 March.[85] In 1752 it was moved back to 1 January. (See Calendar (New Style) Act 1750).\\r\\nEven before 1752, 1 January was sometimes treated as the start of the new year ÿ for example by Pepys[86] ÿ while the \\"year starting 25th March was called the Civil or Legal Year\\".[87] To reduce misunderstandings on the date, it was not uncommon for a date between 1 January and 24 March to be written as \\"1661/62\\". This was to explain to the reader that the year was 1661 counting from March and 1662 counting from January as the start of the year.[88] (For more detail, see Dual dating).\\r\\nMost western European countries shifted the first day of their numbered year to 1 January while they were still using the Julian calendar, before they adopted the Gregorian calendar, many during the 16th century. The following table shows the years in which various countries adopted 1 January as the start of the year. Eastern European countries, with populations showing allegiance to the Orthodox Church, began the year on 1 September from about 988. The Rumi calendar used in the Ottoman Empire began the civil year on 1 March until 1918.\\r\\nThe Julian calendar was in general use in Europe and northern Africa until 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII promulgated the Gregorian calendar. Reform was required because too many leap days are added with respect to the astronomical seasons on the Julian scheme. On average, the astronomical solstices and the equinoxes advance by about 11 minutes per year against the Julian year. As a result, the calculated date of Easter gradually moved out of alignment with the March equinox.\\r\\nWhile Hipparchus and presumably Sosigenes were aware of the discrepancy, although not of its correct value,[96] it was evidently felt to be of little importance at the time of the Julian reform. However, it accumulated significantly over time: the Julian calendar gained a day about every 134 years. By 1582, it was ten days out of alignment from where it supposedly had been in 325 during the Council of Nicaea.\\r\\nThe Gregorian calendar was soon adopted by most Catholic countries (e.g., Spain, Portugal, Poland, most of Italy). Protestant countries followed later, and some countries of eastern Europe even later. In the British Empire (including the American colonies), Wednesday 2 September 1752 was followed by Thursday 14 September 1752. For 12 years from 1700 Sweden used a modified Julian calendar, and adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1753.\\r\\nSince the Julian and Gregorian calendars were long used simultaneously, although in different places, calendar dates in the transition period are often ambiguous, unless it is specified which calendar was being used. In some circumstances, double dates might be used, one in each calendar. The notation \\"Old Style\\" (O.S.) is sometimes used to indicate a date in the Julian calendar, as opposed to \\"New Style\\" (N.S.), which either represents the Julian date with the start of the year as 1 January or a full mapping onto the Gregorian calendar. This notation is used to clarify dates from countries which continued to use the Julian calendar after the Gregorian reform, such as Great Britain, which did not switch to the reformed calendar until 1752, or Russia, which did not switch until 1918. This is why the Russian Revolution of 7 November 1917 N.S. is known as the October Revolution, because it began on 25 October OS.\\r\\nThroughout the long transition period, the Julian calendar has continued to diverge from the Gregorian. This has happened in whole-day steps, as leap days which were dropped in certain centennial years in the Gregorian calendar continued to be present in the Julian calendar. Thus, in the year 1700 the difference increased to 11 days; in 1800, 12; and in 1900, 13. Since 2000 was a leap year according to both the Julian and Gregorian calendars, the difference of 13 days did not change in that year: 29 February 2000 (Gregorian) fell on 16 February 2000 (Julian). This difference will persist until the last day of February 2100 (Gregorian), since 2100 is not a Gregorian leap year, but is a Julian leap year. Monday 1 March 2100 (Gregorian) falls on Monday 16 February 2100 (Julian).[97]\\r\\nAlthough most Eastern Orthodox countries (most of them in eastern or southeastern Europe) had adopted the Gregorian calendar by 1924, their national churches had not. The \\"Revised Julian calendar\\" was endorsed by a synod in Constantinople in May 1923, consisting of a solar part which was and will be identical to the Gregorian calendar until the year 2800, and a lunar part which calculated Easter astronomically at Jerusalem. All Orthodox churches refused to accept the lunar part, so almost all Orthodox churches continue to celebrate Easter according to the Julian calendar (with the exception of the Estonian Orthodox Church and the Finnish Orthodox Church).[98][99]\\r\\nThe solar part of the Revised Julian calendar was accepted by only some Orthodox churches. Those that did accept it, with hope for improved dialogue and negotiations with the western denominations, were the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch, the Orthodox Churches of Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Poland (from 1924 to 2014 but remain permitted to use the Revised Julian calendar in parishes that want it), Bulgaria (the last in 1963), and the Orthodox Church in America (although some OCA parishes are permitted to use the Julian calendar). Thus these churches celebrate the Nativity on the same day that western Christians do, 25 December Gregorian until 2799.\\r\\nThe Orthodox Churches of Jerusalem, Russia, Serbia, Montenegro, Poland (from 15 June 2014), Macedonia, Georgia, Ukraine, and the Greek Old Calendarists and other groups continue to use the Julian calendar, thus they celebrate the Nativity on 25 December Julian (which is 7 January Gregorian until 2100). The Russian Orthodox Church has some parishes in the west which celebrate the Nativity on 25 December Gregorian until 2799.\\r\\nParishes of the Orthodox Church in America Bulgarian Diocese, both before and after the 1976 transfer of that diocese from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia to the Orthodox Church in America, were permitted to use this date. Some Old Calendarist groups which stand in opposition to the state churches of their homelands will use the Great Feast of the Theophany (6 January Julian/19 January Gregorian) as a day for religious processions and the Great Blessing of Waters, to publicise their cause.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Oriental Orthodox Churches generally use the local calendar of their homelands. However, when calculating the Nativity Feast, most observe the Julian calendar. This was traditionally for the sake of unity throughout Christendom. In the west, some Oriental Orthodox Churches either use the Gregorian calendar or are permitted to observe the Nativity according to it. The Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Church celebrates the Nativity as part of the Feast of Theophany according to its traditional calendar.[citation needed]","input":"How many days in a julian calendar year?"},{"output":"in the late 1950s","context":"Nuclear power in Germany accounted for 17.7% of national electricity supply in 2011, compared to 22.4% in 2010.[2][3] German nuclear power began with research reactors in the 1950s and 1960s with the first commercial plant coming online in 1969. As of 2017, the share of nuclear power in the electricity sector in the country is decreasing following the decision of a complete nuclear phase-out by the next decade.\\r\\nNuclear power has been a topical political issue in recent decades, with continuing debates about when the technology should be phased out. The anti-nuclear movement in Germany has a long history dating back to the early 1970s, when large demonstrations prevented the construction of a nuclear plant at Wyhl. The topic received renewed attention at the start of 2007 due to the political impact of the Russia-Belarus energy dispute and in 2011 after the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.[4] Within days of the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, large anti-nuclear protests occurred in Germany. Protests continued and, on 29 May 2011, Merkel's government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by 2022.[5][6]\\r\\nEight of the seventeen operating reactors in Germany were permanently shut down following Fukushima. Chancellor Angela Merkel said the nuclear power phase-out, previously scheduled to go offline as late as 2036, would give Germany a competitive advantage in the renewable energy era, stating, \\"As the first big industrialized nation, we can achieve such a transformation toward efficient and renewable energies, with all the opportunities that brings for exports, developing new technologies and jobs\\". Merkel also pointed to Japan's \\"helplessness\\" ÿ despite being an industrialized, technologically advanced nation ÿ in the face of its nuclear disaster.[7]\\r\\nGerman engineering giant Siemens announced a complete withdrawal from the nuclear industry in 2011, as a response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.[8][9] Remaining nuclear companies in Germany are E.ON Kernkraft GmbH, Vattenfall Europe Nuclear Energy GmbH, RWE Power AG, and EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman publications of the 1950s and 1960s contained criticism of some features of nuclear power including its safety. Nuclear waste disposal was widely recognized as a major problem, with concern publicly expressed as early as 1954. In 1964, one author went so far as to state \\"that the dangers and costs of the necessary final disposal of nuclear waste could possibly make it necessary to forego the development of nuclear energy\\".[10]\\r\\nAs in many industrialised countries, nuclear power in Germany was first developed in the late 1950s. Only a few experimental reactors went online before 1960, and an experimental nuclear power station in Kahl am Main opened in 1960. All of the German nuclear power plants that opened between 1960 and 1970 had a power output of less than 1,000?MW and have now all closed down. The first commercial nuclear power plant started operating in 1969. Obrigheim, the first grid station, operated until 2005. (Neckarwestheim.) A closed nuclear fuel cycle was planned, starting with mining operations in the Saarland and the Schwarzwald; uranium ore concentration, fuel rod filling production in Hanau; and reprocessing of the spent fuel in the never-built nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Wackersdorf. The radioactive waste was intended to be stored in a deep geological repository, as part of the Gorleben long-term storage project.\\r\\nIn the early 1960s there was a proposal to build a nuclear power station in West Berlin, but the project was dropped in 1962. Another attempt to site a reactor in a major city was made in 1967, when BASF planned to build a nuclear power station on its ground at Ludwigshafen, to supply process steam. Eventually the project was withdrawn by BASF.[10]\\r\\nIn the early 1970s, large public demonstrations prevented the construction of a nuclear plant at Wyhl. The Wyhl protests were an example of a local community challenging the nuclear industry through a strategy of direct action and civil disobedience. Police were accused of using unnecessarily violent means. Anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired nuclear opposition throughout Germany and elsewhere.[11]\\r\\nThe Rheinsberg Nuclear Power Plant was the first (mostly experimental) nuclear power plant in East Germany. It was of low power and operated from 1966 until 1990. The second to be commissioned, the Greifswald Nuclear Power Plant, was planned to house eight of the Russian 440?MW VVER-440 reactors. The first four went online between 1973 and 1979. Greifswald 5 operated for less than a month before it was closed, the other three were cancelled during different stages of their build-up. In 1990, during the German reunification, all nuclear power plants were closed due to the differences in safety standards.\\r\\nThe Stendal Nuclear Power Plant in East Germany, was to be the largest nuclear power station in Germany. After German reunification, and due to concerns about the Soviet design, construction was stopped and the power station was never completed. In the 1990s the three cooling towers which had been erected were demolished, and the area is an industrial estate today.\\r\\nAs of 2016[update] the nuclear power plant operators in Germany comprise:\\r\\nIn September 2011, Siemens, which had been responsible for constructing all 17 of Germany's existing nuclear power plants, announced that it would exit the nuclear sector following the Fukushima disaster and the subsequent changes to German energy policy. It will no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world. The companys chairman, Peter L?scher, said that \\"Siemens was ending plans to cooperate with Rosatom, the Russian state-controlled nuclear power company, in the construction of dozens of nuclear plants throughout Russia over the coming two decades\\".[9][12] Peter L?scher has supported the German government's planned energy transition to renewable energy technologies, calling it a \\"project of the century\\" and saying Berlin's target of reaching 35% renewable energy sources by 2020 was feasible.[13]\\r\\nAn October 2016 story in the Sddeutsche Zeitung reports that Finnish operator TVO is calling on Siemens to take financial responsibility for the completion of Unit?3 of the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant in Finland, because its project partner, the French Areva Group, is being broken up by the French government. Unit?3 has a history of delays and its future profitability is in doubt.[14][15]\\r\\nDuring the chancellorship of Gerhard Schr?der, the social democratic-green government had decreed Germany's final retreat from using nuclear power by 2022, but the phase-out plan was initially delayed in late 2010, when during chancellorship of center-right Angela Merkel the coalition conservative-liberal government decreed a 12-year delay of the schedule.[18] This delay provoked protests, including a human chain of 50,000 from Stuttgart to the nearby nuclear plant in Neckarwestheim.[19] Anti-nuclear demonstrations on 12?March attracted 100,000 across Germany.[20]\\r\\nOn 14 March 2011, in response to the renewed concern about the use of nuclear energy the Fukushima incident raised in the German public and in light of upcoming elections in three German states, Merkel declared a 3-month moratorium on the reactor lifespan extension passed in 2010.[21] On 15 March, the German government announced that it would temporarily shut down 8 of its 17?reactors, i.e. all reactors that went online before 1981.[22] Former proponents of nuclear energy such as Angela Merkel, Guido Westerwelle, and Stefan Mappus have changed their positions,[23] yet 71% of the population believe that to be a tactical manoeuvre related to upcoming state elections.[24] In the largest anti-nuclear demonstration ever held in Germany, some 250,000 people protested on 26?March under the slogan \\"heed Fukushima ÿ shut off all nuclear plants\\".[25]\\r\\nOn 30 May 2011, the German government announced a plan to shut all nuclear reactors by 2022.[26] Environment Minister Norbert R?ttgen stated of the decision, \\"It's definite. The latest end for the last three nuclear power plants is 2022. There will be no clause for revision\\".[4] Prior to the decision, Germany's renewable energy sector already provided 17% of Germany's electricity and employed about 370,000.[7] The decision to phase-out nuclear power has been called the swiftest change of political course since unification.[27] Only a year earlier Angela Merkel's government overturned a decade-old decision to close all nuclear plants by 2022.[27]\\r\\nPhysicist Amory Lovins has said: \\"Chancellor Merkel was so shocked by Fukushima that she turned Germanys energy focus from nuclear (of which she closed 41% and will close the rest within a decade) to efficiency and renewables. Thats supported by three-fourths of Germans and opposed by no political party\\".[28]\\r\\nMerkel stated that Germany \\"[does not] only want to renounce nuclear energy by 2022, we also want to reduce our CO2 emissions by 40?percent and double our share of renewable energies, from about 17?percent today to then 35?percent\\". The chancellor noted the \\"helplessness\\" of Japan to manage the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Merkel asserted that Germany's energy policy would be safe, reliable, and independent from imports, with affordable prices for both consumers and industry. Increased investment in natural gas plants would provide a backup to ensure consistency for those times when the solar, wind and hydroelectric sources did not meet demand.[7]\\r\\nAt the time of the Japanese Fukushima disaster, Germany was getting just under a quarter of its electricity from nuclear power.[7] After the Fukushima disaster, the following eight German nuclear power reactors were declared permanently shut down on 6 August 2011: Biblis?A and?B, Brunsbuettel, Isar?1, Kruemmel, Neckarwestheim?1, Philippsburg?1 and Unterweser.[29]\\r\\nSome German manufacturers and energy companies have criticized the phase-out plans, warning that Germany could face blackouts.[30] However, this did not happen.[31] Germany remained a net exporter of about 7016180000000000000?5?TWh of power in 2011 after exporting 7016637200000000000?17.7?TWh in 2010, according to data published by the energy utility association \\"AG Energiebilanzen\\" in February 2012.[32] Swedish Energy company Vattenfall went in front of the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to seek compensation from the German government for the premature shut-down of its nuclear plants.[33][34]\\r\\nOn 5?December 2016, the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) ruled that the nuclear plant operators affected by the accelerated phase-out of nuclear power following the Fukushima disaster are eligible for \\"adequate\\" compensation. The court found that the nuclear exit was essentially constitutional but that the utilities are entitled to damages for the \\"good faith\\" investments they made in 2010. The utilities can now sue the German government under civil law. E.ON, RWE, and Vattenfall are expected to seek a total of ?19?billion under separate suits.[35][36][37] Six cases were registered with courts in Germany, as of 7?December?2016[update].[38][39]\\r\\nOn 19?October 2016, the German cabinet (Bundeskabinett) finalized a deal with nuclear power plant operators E.ON, EnBW, RWE, and Vattenfall over long-term nuclear waste disposal. Under the agreement, the four operators are freed of responsibility for storing radioactive waste ÿ that responsibility is instead transferred to the state. In return, the operators will pay a total of ?17.4?billion into a state-administered fund to finance the interim and final storage of nuclear waste. They will also pay an additional \\"risk surcharge\\" of ?6.2?billion (35.5%) to cover the eventuality that costs exceed current projections and that the interest accrued by the fund is lower than expected. The operators will be responsible for decommissioning and deconstructing their own nuclear power plants, as well as preparing their radioactive waste for final storage. Critics, including the German Renewable Energy Federation and BUND, claim the total of ?23.6?billion would prove insufficient and that future taxpayers will carry the risk.[40] The draft law is available in German.[41] It is due to be enacted in early 2017.\\r\\nSince nuclear power generated almost a third of the electricity in Germany, many thought that the country would have to import energy as the nuclear phase-out progressed. At first, Germany was still selling more electricity than it bought, due to its renewable energy industry.[42] Renewable energy supplied a record 20.8% of Germanys electricity in the first half of 2011, from wind power, solar power, biomass and hydro. Germany installed over 7,400 MW of solar in 2010 and another 7,000 MW will be added in 2011. Solar and wind capacity is expected to grow by 32% from 2012ÿ2013. The surge in renewable energy is credited with driving down the price of electricity in Germany.[42]\\r\\nGermany has combined the phase-out with an initiative for renewable energy and wants to increase the efficiency of fossil power plants in an effort to reduce the reliance on coal. According to the former German Minister for the Environment Jrgen Trittin, in 2020, this would cut carbon dioxide emissions by 40?percent compared with 1990?levels. Germany has become one of the leaders in the efforts to fulfill the Kyoto protocol. Critics of the German policy have called it a mistake to abandon nuclear power, claiming the only alternative to nuclear power was coal and abandoning nuclear power was therefore contradictory to the goal of lowering CO2 emissions.[43]\\r\\nAs a result of its efforts and subsidies, Germany has developed advanced non-conventional renewable energy for electricity generation, particularly in photovoltaic and wind turbine installations. At the same time, Germany continues to rely heavily on coal power, with usage increasing to offset the phase-out of nuclear energy.[44]\\r\\nThe German nuclear industry has insisted that its shutdown would cause major damage to the country's industrial base. In 2012, member firms of the Verband der Industriellen Energie- und Kraftwirtschaft (VIK) reported power failures of several seconds duration, combined with a rise in frequency fluctuations. These were reportedly caused by network overloads due to the shutdown of nuclear power plants, and an increase in wind power generation.[45] VIK also fear that industrial control units will be damaged by outages.\\r\\nThe cost of replacing Germany's nuclear power generation with renewable energy has been officially estimated by the German Ministry of Economics at about ?0.01/kWh (about ?55?billion for the next decade), on top of the ?13?billion per year already devoted to subsidizing renewables. However, unofficial estimates of the ministry, and of the Rhenish-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI), German Energy Agency (DENA), Federation of German Consumer Organizations (VZBV), and the government-owned development bank (KfW), put the cost several times higher, at about ?250?billion ($340?B) over the next decade.[46][47]\\r\\nIn March 2013, the administrative court for the German state of Hesse ruled that a three-month closure imposed by the government on RWE's Biblis A and B reactors as an immediate response to Fukushima Daiichi accident was illegal.[48] The state ministry of the environment acted illegally in March 2011, when an order was issued for the immediate closure of the Biblis units. RWE complied with the decree by shutting Biblis-A immediately, however as the plants were in compliance with the relevant safety requirements, the German government had no legal grounds for shutting them. The court ruled that the closure notice was illegal because RWE had not been given sufficient opportunity to respond to the order.","input":"When did germany build its first nuclear power plant?"},{"output":"April 1917","context":"","input":"When did the usa enter world war 1?"},{"output":"24 October 1945","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization tasked to promote international co-operation and to create and maintain international order. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II with the aim of preventing another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the UN is in Manhattan, New York City, and is subject to extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. The UN is the largest, most familiar, most internationally represented and most powerful intergovernmental organization in the world.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN Charter was drafted at a conference between April and June 1945 in San Francisco, and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the conclusion of the conference;[4][5] this charter took effect on 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the Israeli state in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN has six principal organs: the General Assembly (the main deliberative assembly); the Security Council (for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security); the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC; for promoting international economic and social co-operation and development); the Secretariat (for providing studies, information, and facilities needed by the UN); the International Court of Justice (the primary judicial organ); and the UN Trusteeship Council (inactive since 1994). UN System agencies include the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNESCO, and UNICEF. The UN's most prominent officer is the Secretary-General, an office held by Portuguese politician and diplomat Ant܇nio Guterres since 2017. Non-governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN's work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organization won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001, and a number of its officers and agencies have also been awarded the prize. Other evaluations of the UN's effectiveness have been mixed. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development, while others have called the organization ineffective, corrupt, or biased.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the century prior to the UN's creation, several international treaty organizations and conferences had been formed to regulate conflicts between nations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.[6] Following the catastrophic loss of life in the First World War, the Paris Peace Conference established the League of Nations to maintain harmony between countries.[7] This organization resolved some territorial disputes and created international structures for areas such as postal mail, aviation, and opium control, some of which would later be absorbed into the UN.[8] However, the League lacked representation for colonial peoples (then half the world's population) and significant participation from several major powers, including the US, USSR, Germany, and Japan; it failed to act against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935, the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, and German expansions under Adolf Hitler that culminated in the Second World War.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis of the U.S. State Department in 1939.[10] The text of the \\"Declaration by United Nations\\" was drafted at the White House on December 29, 1941, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins. It incorporated Soviet suggestions, but left no role for France. \\"Four Policemen\\" was coined to refer to four major Allied countries, United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Republic of China, which emerged in the Declaration by United Nations.[11] Roosevelt first coined the term United Nations to describe the Allied countries.[b]  \\"On New Year's Day 1942, President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, Maxim Litvinov, of the USSR, and T. V. Soong, of China, signed a short document which later came to be known as the United Nations Declaration and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures.\\"[12] The term United Nations was first officially used when 26 governments signed this Declaration. One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom, which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted.[13][14] By 1 March 1945, 21 additional states had signed.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nA JOINT DECLARATION BY THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND, THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, BELGIUM, CANADA, COSTA RICA, CUBA, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, EL SALVADOR, GREECE, GUATEMALA, HAITI, HONDURAS, INDIA, LUXEMBOURG, NETHERLANDS, NEW ZEALAND, NICARAGUA, NORWAY, PANAMA, POLAND, SOUTH AFRICA, YUGOSLAVIA\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governments signatory hereto,\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving subscribed to a common program of purposes and principles embodied in the Joint Declaration of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of Great Britain dated August 14, 1941, known as the Atlantic Charter,\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing convinced that complete victory over their enemies is essential to defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands, and that they are now engaged in a common struggle against savage and brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world,\\r\\n\\r\\nDECLARE:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foregoing declaration may be adhered to by other nations which are, or which may be, rendering material assistance and contributions in the struggle for victory over Hitlerism.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the war, \\"the United Nations\\" became the official term for the Allies. To join, countries had to sign the Declaration and declare war on the Axis.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN was formulated and negotiated among the delegations from the Allied Big Four (the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and China) at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944.[17][18] After months of planning, the UN Conference on International Organization opened in San Francisco, 25 April 1945, attended by 50 governments and a number of non-governmental organizations involved in drafting the UN Charter.[4][5][19] \\"The heads of the delegations of the sponsoring countries took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings: Anthony Eden, of Britain, Edward Stettinius, of the United States, T.

Soong, and Mister Gromyko for Mister Molotov.\\"[20] The UN officially came into existence 24 October 1945, upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security CouncilFrance, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the UK and the USand by a majority of the other 46 signatories.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first meetings of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented,[c] and the Security Council took place in London beginning 10 January 1946.[21] The General Assembly selected New York City as the site for the headquarters of the UN, and the facility was completed in 1952. Its sitelike UN headquarters buildings in Geneva, Vienna, and Nairobiis designated as international territory.[24] The Norwegian Foreign Minister, Trygve Lie, was elected as the first UN Secretary-General.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the UN's primary mandate was peacekeeping, the division between the US and USSR often paralysed the organization, generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the Cold War.[25] (A notable exception was a Security Council resolution in 1950 authorizing a US-led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea, passed in the absence of the USSR.)[21][26] In 1947, the General Assembly approved a resolution to partition Palestine, approving the creation of the state of Israel. Two years later, Ralph Bunche, a UN official, negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict.[27] In 1956, the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis;[28] however, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR's simultaneous invasion of Hungary following that country's revolution.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960, the UN deployed United Nations Operation in the Congo (UNOC), the largest military force of its early decades, to bring order to the breakaway State of Katanga, restoring it to the control of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by 1964.[30] While travelling to meet rebel leader Moise Tshombe during the conflict, Dag Hammarskj?ld, often named as one of the UN's most effective Secretaries-General,[31] died in a plane crash; months later he was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[32] In 1964, Hammarskj?ld's successor, U Thant, deployed the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, which would become one of the UN's longest-running peacekeeping missions.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the spread of decolonization in the 1960s, the organization's membership saw an influx of newly independent nations. In 1960 alone, 17 new states joined the UN, 16 of them from Africa.[28] On 25 October 1971, with opposition from the United States, but with the support of many Third World nations, the mainland, communist People's Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the Republic of China that occupied Taiwan; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization.[34] Third World nations organized into the Group of 77 coalition under the leadership of Algeria, which briefly became a dominant power at the UN.[35] In 1975, a bloc comprising the USSR and Third World nations passed a resolution, over strenuous US and Israeli opposition, declaring Zionism to be racism; the resolution was repealed in 1991, shortly after the end of the Cold War.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle East, Vietnam, and Kashmir, the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange.[37] By the 1970s, the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Cold War, the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties, taking on more missions in ten years than it had in the previous four decades.[38] Between 1988 and 2000, the number of adopted Security Council resolutions more than doubled, and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold.[39][40][41] The UN negotiated an end to the Salvadoran Civil War, launched a successful peacekeeping mission in Namibia, and oversaw democratic elections in post-apartheid South Africa and post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia.[42] In 1991, the UN authorized a US-led coalition that repulsed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.[43] Brian Urquhart, Under-Secretary-General from 1971 to 1985, later described the hopes raised by these successes as a \\"false renaissance\\" for the organization, given the more troubled missions that followed.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another, in the early 1990s the UN faced a number of simultaneous, serious crises within nations such as Somalia, Haiti, Mozambique, and the former Yugoslavia.[45] The UN mission in Somalia was widely viewed as a failure after the US withdrawal following casualties in the Battle of Mogadishu, and the UN mission to Bosnia faced \\"worldwide ridicule\\" for its indecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing.[46] In 1994, the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda failed to intervene in the Rwandan genocide amid indecision in the Security Council.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the last decades of the Cold War, American and European critics of the UN condemned the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption.[48] In 1984, the US President, Ronald Reagan, withdrew his nation's funding from UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, founded 1946) over allegations of mismanagement, followed by Britain and Singapore.[49][50] Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, reducing the size of the organization somewhat.[51][52] His successor, Kofi Annan (1997ÿ2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1990s and 2000s, international interventions authorized by the UN took a wider variety of forms. The UN mission in the Sierra Leone Civil War of 1991ÿ2002 was supplemented by British Royal Marines, and the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 was overseen by NATO.[53]In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization, prompting a new round of questioning of the organization's effectiveness.[54] Under the eighth Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, the UN has intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the War in Darfur in Sudan and the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and sent observers and chemical weapons inspectors to the Syrian Civil War.[55] In 2013, an internal review of UN actions in the final battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered \\"systemic failure\\".[56] One hundred and one UN personnel died in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the worst loss of life in the organization's history.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Millennium Summit was held in 2000 to discuss the UN's role in the 21st century.[58] The three day meeting was the largest gathering of world leaders in history, and culminated in the adoption by all member states of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a commitment to achieve international development in areas such as poverty reduction, gender equality, and public health. Progress towards these goals, which were to be met by 2015, was ultimately uneven. The 2005 World Summit reaffirmed the UN's focus on promoting development, peacekeeping, human rights, and global security.[59] The Sustainable Development Goals were launched in 2015 to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to addressing global challenges, the UN has sought to improve its accountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society and fostering a global constituency.[61] In an effort to enhance transparency, in 2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for Secretary-General.[62] On 1 January 2017, Portuguese diplomat Ant܇nio Guterres, who previously served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, became the ninth Secretary-General. Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration, including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts, more effective peacekeeping efforts, and streamlining the organization to be more responsive and versatile to global needs.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN system is based on five principal organs: the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the Secretariat, and the International Court of Justice.[64] A sixth principal organ, the Trusteeship Council, suspended operations in 1994, upon the independence of Palau, the last remaining UN trustee territory.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour of the five principal organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City.[66] The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague, while other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva,[67] Vienna,[68] and Nairobi.[69] Other UN institutions are located throughout the world. The six official languages of the UN, used in intergovernmental meetings and documents, are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.[70] On the basis of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, the UN and its agencies are immune from the laws of the countries where they operate, safeguarding the UN's impartiality with regard to the host and member countries.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow the six organs sit, in the words of the author Linda Fasulo, \\"an amazing collection of entities and organizations, some of which are actually older than the UN itself and operate with almost complete independence from it\\".[72] These include specialized agencies, research and training institutions, programmes and funds, and other UN entities.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN obey the Noblemaire principle, which is binding on any organization that belongs to the UN system. This principle calls for salaries that will draw and keep citizens of countries where salaries are highest, and also calls for equal pay for work of equal value independent of the employee's nationality.[74][75] In practice, the ICSC takes reference to the highest-paying national civil service.[76] Staff salaries are subject to an internal tax that is administered by the UN organizations.[74][77]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe General Assembly is the main deliberative assembly of the UN. Composed of all UN member states, the assembly meets in regular yearly sessions, but emergency sessions can also be called.[79] The assembly is led by a president, elected from among the member states on a rotating regional basis, and 21 vice-presidents.[80] The first session convened 10 January 1946 in the Methodist Central Hall in London and included representatives of 51 nations.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the General Assembly votes on important questions, a two-thirds majority of those present and voting is required. Examples of important questions include recommendations on peace and security; election of members to organs; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and budgetary matters.[81] All other questions are decided by a majority vote. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nDraft resolutions can be forwarded to the General Assembly by its six main committees:[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as by the following two committees:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Security Council is charged with maintaining peace and security among countries. While other organs of the UN can only make \\"recommendations\\" to member states, the Security Council has the power to make binding decisions that member states have agreed to carry out, under the terms of Charter Article 25.[83] The decisions of the Council are known as United Nations Security Council resolutions.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Security Council is made up of fifteen member states, consisting of five permanent membersChina, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United Statesand ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly (with end of term date)Bolivia (term ends 2018), C?te dIvoire (2019), Equatorial Guinea (2019), Ethiopia (2018), Kazakhstan (2018), Kuwait (2019), Netherlands (2018), Peru (2019), Poland (2019), and Sweden (2018).[85] The five permanent members hold veto power over UN resolutions, allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution, though not debate. The ten temporary seats are held for two-year terms, with five member states per year voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis.[86] The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN Secretariat is headed by the Secretary-General, assisted by the Deputy Secretary-General and a staff of international civil servants worldwide.[88] It provides studies, information, and facilities needed by UN bodies for their meetings. It also carries out tasks as directed by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and other UN bodies.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secretary-General acts as the de facto spokesperson and leader of the UN. The position is defined in the UN Charter as the organization's \\"chief administrative officer\\".[90] Article 99 of the charter states that the Secretary-General can bring to the Security Council's attention \\"any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security\\", a phrase that Secretaries-General since Trygve Lie have interpreted as giving the position broad scope for action on the world stage.[91] The office has evolved into a dual role of an administrator of the UN organization and a diplomat and mediator addressing disputes between member states and finding consensus to global issues.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly, after being recommended by the Security Council, where the permanent members have veto power. There are no specific criteria for the post, but over the years it has become accepted that the post shall be held for one or two terms of five years.[93]  The current Secretary-General is Ant܇nio Guterres, who replaced Ban Ki-moon in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ), located in The Hague, in the Netherlands, is the primary judicial organ of the UN. Established in 1945 by the UN Charter, the Court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The ICJ is composed of 15 judges who serve 9-year terms and are appointed by the General Assembly; every sitting judge must be from a different nation.[95][96]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is based in the Peace Palace in The Hague, sharing the building with the Hague Academy of International Law, a private centre for the study of international law. The ICJ's primary purpose is to adjudicate disputes among states. The court has heard cases related to war crimes, illegal state interference, ethnic cleansing, and other issues.[97] The ICJ can also be called upon by other UN organs to provide advisory opinions.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) assists the General Assembly in promoting international economic and social co-operation and development. ECOSOC has 54 members, which are elected by the General Assembly for a three-year term. The president is elected for a one-year term and chosen amongst the small or middle powers represented on ECOSOC. The council has one annual meeting in July, held in either New York or Geneva. Viewed as separate from the specialized bodies it co-ordinates, ECOSOC's functions include information gathering, advising member nations, and making recommendations.[98][99] Owing to its broad mandate of co-ordinating many agencies, ECOSOC has at times been criticized as unfocused or irrelevant.[98][100]\\r\\n\\r\\nECOSOC's subsidiary bodies include the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, which advises UN agencies on issues relating to indigenous peoples; the United Nations Forum on Forests, which co-ordinates and promotes sustainable forest management; the United Nations Statistical Commission, which co-ordinates information-gathering efforts between agencies; and the Commission on Sustainable Development, which co-ordinates efforts between UN agencies and NGOs working towards sustainable development. ECOSOC may also grant consultative status to non-governmental organizations;[98] by 2004, more than 2,200 organizations had received this status.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN Charter stipulates that each primary organ of the United Nations can establish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties.[102] Some best-known agencies are the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through the work of the WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by UNHCR).[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the addition of South Sudan 14 July 2011,[105] there are 193 UN member states, including all undisputed independent states apart from Vatican City.[106][d]\\r\\nThe UN Charter outlines the rules for membership:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, there are two non-member observer states of the United Nations General Assembly: the Holy See (which holds sovereignty over Vatican City) and the State of Palestine.[108] The Cook Islands and Niue, both states in free association with New Zealand, are full members of several UN specialized agencies and have had their \\"full treaty-making capacity\\" recognized by the Secretariat.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group of 77 at the UN is a loose coalition of developing nations, designed to promote its members' collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the UN. Seventy-seven nations founded the organization, but by November 2013 the organization had since expanded to 133 member countries.[110] The group was founded 15 June 1964 by the \\"Joint Declaration of the Seventy-Seven Countries\\" issued at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The group held its first major meeting in Algiers in 1967, where it adopted the Charter of Algiers and established the basis for permanent institutional structures.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN, after approval by the Security Council, sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states. These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed \\"Blue Helmets\\" for their distinctive gear.[112][113] The peacekeeping force as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2013, the UN had peacekeeping soldiers deployed on 15 missions. The largest was the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), which included 20,688 uniformed personnel. The smallest, United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), included 42 uniformed personnel responsible for monitoring the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir. UN peacekeepers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) have been stationed in the Middle East since 1948, the longest-running active peacekeeping mission.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study by the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace.[116] Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activismmostly spearheaded by the UNhas been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period.[117] Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950ÿ53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990ÿ91).[118]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN has also drawn criticism for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention are seen as having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971,[119] the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s,[120] and the Rwandan genocide in 1994.[121] Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992ÿ93 during the Somali Civil War.[122] UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,[123] Haiti,[124] Liberia,[125] Sudan and what is now South Sudan,[126] Burundi, and Ivory Coast.[127] Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010ÿ13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to peacekeeping, the UN is also active in encouraging disarmament. Regulation of armaments was included in the writing of the UN Charter in 1945 and was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic resources for their creation.[83] The advent of nuclear weapons came only weeks after the signing of the charter, resulting in the first resolution of the first General Assembly meeting calling for specific proposals for \\"the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction\\".[129] The UN has been involved with arms-limitation treaties, such as the Outer Space Treaty (1967), the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968), the Seabed Arms Control Treaty (1971), the Biological Weapons Convention (1972), the Chemical Weapons Convention (1992), and the Ottawa Treaty (1997), which prohibits landmines.[130] Three UN bodies oversee arms proliferation issues: the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the UN's primary purposes is \\"promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\\", and member states pledge to undertake \\"joint and separate action\\" to protect these rights.[102][132]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1948, the General Assembly adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, drafted by a committee headed by American diplomat and activist Eleanor Roosevelt, and including the French lawyer Ren Cassin. The document proclaims basic civil, political, and economic rights common to all human beings, though its effectiveness towards achieving these ends has been disputed since its drafting.[133] The Declaration serves as a \\"common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations\\" rather than a legally binding document, but it has become the basis of two binding treaties, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.[134] In practice, the UN is unable to take significant action against human rights abuses without a Security Council resolution, though it does substantial work in investigating and reporting abuses.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1979, the General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, followed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989.[136] With the end of the Cold War, the push for human rights action took on new impetus.[137] The United Nations Commission on Human Rights was formed in 1993 to oversee human rights issues for the UN, following the recommendation of that year's World Conference on Human Rights. Jacques Fomerand, a scholar of the UN, describes this organization's mandate as \\"broad and vague\\", with only \\"meagre\\" resources to carry it out.[138] In 2006, it was replaced by a Human Rights Council consisting of 47 nations.[139] Also in 2006, the General Assembly passed a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,[140] and in 2011 it passed its first resolution recognizing the rights of LGBT people.[141]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther UN bodies responsible for women's rights issues include United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, a commission of ECOSOC founded in 1946; the United Nations Development Fund for Women, created in 1976; and the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, founded in 1979.[142] The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, one of three bodies with a mandate to oversee issues related to indigenous peoples, held its first session in 2002.[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nMillennium Development Goals[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother primary purpose of the UN is \\"to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character\\".[132] Numerous bodies have been created to work towards this goal, primarily under the authority of the General Assembly and ECOSOC.[145] In 2000, the 192 UN member states agreed to achieve eight Millennium Development Goals by 2015.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN Development Programme (UNDP), an organization for grant-based technical assistance founded in 1945, is one of the leading bodies in the field of international development. The organization also publishes the UN Human Development Index, a comparative measure ranking countries by poverty, literacy, education, life expectancy, and other factors.[147][148] The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), also founded in 1945, promotes agricultural development and food security.[149] UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund) was created in 1946 to aid European children after the Second World War and expanded its mission to provide aid around the world and to uphold the Convention on the Rights of the Child.[150][151]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are independent, specialized agencies and observers within the UN framework, according to a 1947 agreement. They were initially formed separately from the UN through the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944.[152] The World Bank provides loans for international development, while the IMF promotes international economic co-operation and gives emergency loans to indebted countries.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), which focuses on international health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river blindness, and leprosy.[154] The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic.[155] The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services.[156]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the UN often takes a leading role in co-ordinating emergency relief.[157] The World Food Programme (WFP), created in 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year.[157][158] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, works to protect the rights of refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people.[159] UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative costs are paid for by the UN's primary budget.[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the UN's creation, over 80 colonies have attained independence. The General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in 1960 with no votes against but abstentions from all major colonial powers. The UN works towards decolonization through groups including the UN Committee on Decolonization, created in 1962.[161] The committee lists seventeen remaining \\"Non-Self-Governing Territories\\", the largest and most populous of which is Western Sahara.[162]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with the formation of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts.[163] In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming.[164] The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.[165]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN also declares and co-ordinates international observances, periods of time to observe issues of international interest or concern. Examples include World Tuberculosis Day, Earth Day, and the International Year of Deserts and Desertification.[166]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from member states. The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the assessment for each member. This is broadly based on the relative capacity of each country to pay, as measured by its gross national income (GNI), with adjustments for external debt and low per capita income.[168] The two-year budget for 2012ÿ13 was $5.512 billion in total.[169]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Assembly has established the principle that the UN should not be unduly dependent on any one member to finance its operations. Thus, there is a \\"ceiling\\" rate, setting the maximum amount that any member can be assessed for the regular budget. In December 2000, the Assembly revised the scale of assessments in response to pressure from the United States. As part of that revision, the regular budget ceiling was reduced from 25% to 22%.[170] For the least developed countries (LDCs), a ceiling rate of 0.01% is applied.[168] In addition to the ceiling rates, the minimum amount assessed to any member nation (or \\"floor\\" rate) is set at 0.001% of the UN budget ($55,120 for the two year budget 2013ÿ2014).[171]\\r\\n\\r\\nA large share of the UN's expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and security, and this budget is assessed separately from the main organizational budget.[172] The peacekeeping budget for the 2015ÿ16 fiscal year was $8.27 billion, supporting 82,318 troops deployed in 15 missions around the world.[115] UN peace operations are funded by assessments, using a formula derived from the regular funding scale that includes a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council members, who must approve all peacekeeping operations. This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries. In 2017, the top 8 providers of assessed financial contributions to UN peacekeeping operations were the United States  (28.47%), China  (10.25%), Japan  (9.68%), Germany  (6.39%), France  (6.28%), United Kingdom  (5.77%), Russian Federation  (3.99%) and Italy  (3.75%).[173]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial UN programmes not included in the regular budget, such as UNICEF and the World Food Programme, are financed by voluntary contributions from member governments, corporations, and private individuals.[174][175]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of agencies and individuals associated with the UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work. Two Secretaries-General, Dag Hammarskj?ld and Kofi Annan, were each awarded the prize (in 1961 and 2001, respectively), as were Ralph Bunche (1950), a UN negotiator, Ren Cassin (1968), a contributor to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull (1945), the latter for his role in the organization's founding. Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the International Atomic Energy Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice. The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001, sharing it with Annan.[176]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its founding, there have been many calls for reform of the UN but little consensus on how to do so. Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs, while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work. There have also been numerous calls for the UN Security Council's membership to be increased, for different ways of electing the UN's Secretary-General, and for a UN Parliamentary Assembly. Jacques Fomerand states the most enduring divide in views of the UN is \\"the NorthÿSouth split\\" between richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations. Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly, allowing them a greater voice in world affairs, while Northern nations prefer an economically laissez-faire UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism.[177]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter World War II, the French Committee of National Liberation was late to be recognized by the US as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization. The future French president Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN, famously calling it a machin (\\"contraption\\"), and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring direct defence treaties between countries.[178] Throughout the Cold War, both the US and USSR repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other. In 1953, the USSR effectively forced the resignation of Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General, through its refusal to deal with him, while in the 1950s and 1960s, a popular US bumper sticker read, \\"You can't spell communism without U.N.\\"[179] In a sometimes-misquoted statement, President George W. Bush stated in February 2003 (referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime) that \\"free nations will not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society.\\"[180][181][182] In contrast, the French President, Fran?ois Hollande, stated in 2012 that \\"France trusts the United Nations. She knows that no state, no matter how powerful, can solve urgent problems, fight for development and bring an end to all crises... France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance.\\"[183] Critics such as Dore Gold, an Israeli diplomat, Robert S. Wistrich, a British scholar, Alan Dershowitz, an American legal scholar, Mark Dreyfus, an Australian politician, and the Anti-Defamation League consider UN attention to Israel's treatment of Palestinians to be excessive.[184] In September 2015, Saudi Arabia's Faisal bin Hassan Trad has been elected Chair of the UN Human Rights Council panel that appoints independent experts,[185] a move criticized by human rights groups.[186][187]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1971, the Republic of China on Taiwan has been excluded from the UN and since then has always been rejected in new applications. Taiwanese citizens are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the United Nations with ROC passports. In this way, critics agree that the UN is failing its own development goals and guidelines. This criticism also brought pressure from the People's Republic of China, which regards the territories administered by the ROC as their own territory.[188][189]\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency, waste, and corruption. In 1976, the General Assembly established the Joint Inspection Unit to seek out inefficiencies within the UN system. During the 1990s, the US withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative was introduced. In 1994, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog.[190] In 1994, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the UN to Somalia Mohamed Sahnoun published \\"Somalia: The Missed Opportunities\\",[191] a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in Somalia, showing that, between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the Siad Barre regime in January 1991, the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies; when the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN's excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. If radical reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the UN would continue to respond to such crisis with inept improvization.[192] In 2004, the UN faced accusations that its recently ended Oil-for-Food Programmein which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctionshad suffered from widespread corruption, including billions of dollars of kickbacks. An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved, as well as raising \\"significant\\" questions about the role of Kojo Annan, the son of Kofi Annan.[193]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn evaluating the UN as a whole, Jacques Fomerand writes that the \\"accomplishments of the United Nations in the last 60 years are impressive in their own terms. Progress in human development during the 20th century has been dramatic and the UN and its agencies have certainly helped the world become a more hospitable and livable place for millions.\\"[194] Evaluating the first 50 years of the UN's history, the author Stanley Meisler writes that \\"the United Nations never fulfilled the hopes of its founders, but it accomplished a great deal nevertheless\\", citing its role in decolonization and its many successful peacekeeping efforts.[195] The British historian Paul Kennedy states that while the organization has suffered some major setbacks, \\"when all its aspects are considered, the UN has brought great benefits to our generation and ... will bring benefits to our children's and grandchildren's generations as well.\\"[196]\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial websites\\r\\n\\r\\nOther","input":"When did the united nations came into existence?"},{"output":"September 10, 1977","context":"Hamida Djandoubi (Arabic: ????? ???????; September 22, 1949 ÿ September 10, 1977) was a Tunisian agricultural worker and convicted murderer.

It was formed to build transmission lines to supply municipal utilities with electricity generated by private companies already operating at Niagara Falls, and soon developed its own generation resources by buying private generation stations and becoming a major designer and builder of new stations. As most of the readily developed hydroelectric sites became exploited, the corporation expanded into building coal-fired generation and then nuclear-powered facilities. Renamed as \\"Ontario Hydro\\" in 1974, by the 1990s it had become one of the largest, fully integrated electricity corporations in North America.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe notion of generating electric power on the Niagara River was first entertained in 1888, when the Niagara Parks Commission solicited proposals for the construction of an electric scenic railway from Queenston to Chippawa. The Niagara Falls Park & River Railway was granted the privilege in 1892, and by 1900 it was using a dynamo of 200,000 horsepower (150,000?kW) which was the largest in Canada.[1] Starting in 1899, several private syndicates sought privileges from the commission for generating power for sale, including:[2]\\r\\nBy 1900, a total capacity of 400,000 horsepower (300,000?kW) was in development at Niagara, and concern was expressed as to whether such natural resources were being best exploited for the public welfare.[3] In June 1902, an informal convention was held at Berlin, (now Kitchener) which commissioned a report by Daniel B. Detweiler, Elias W.B. Snider and F.S. Spence, who recommended in February 1903 that authority be sought from the Ontario Legislature to allow municipal councils to organize a cooperative to develop, transmit, buy and sell electrical energy.[4] The provincial government of George William Ross refused to allow this, and it was only after its loss in the 1905 election that work began on creating a public utility. During that election campaign, James Pliny Whitney (who would become Premier) declared:\\r\\nThe water power of Niagara should be as free as the air.[5]\\r\\nIn May 1906, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario (\\"Hydro\\" or \\"HEPCO\\") was formed[6] and its first commissioners were Adam Beck, John S. Hendrie, and Cecil B. Smith,[7] HEPCO was a unique hybrid of a government department, crown corporation and municipal cooperative that coexisted with the existing private companies. It was a \\"politically rational\\" rather than a \\"technically efficient\\" solution that depended on the watershed election of 1905.[8]\\r\\nOn January 1, 1907, referendums in Toronto and 18 other municipalities approved the provisional contracts that their councils had concluded with HEPC,[9] and subsequent referendums one year later authorized utility bond issues for the construction of local distribution systems.[10] The victories in Toronto were in large part due to the leadership and commitment of Adam Beck's ally, William Peyton Hubbard.[11] The first transmission lines began providing power to southwestern Ontario in 1910.\\r\\nThe commission's process of expansion was from municipality to municipality, generally in the following manner:[12]\\r\\nDuring the 1920s, Hydro's network expanded significantly:\\r\\nIn 1926, the Ferguson government gave its approval for Abitibi Power and Paper Company to develop the Abitibi Canyon, the largest such development since the Niagara River, in preference to incurring more debt for Ontario Hydro.[16] The development was encouraged through secret commitments for long-term purchases of electricity and indemnification of Hydro against any losses.[16] Questions were asked at the time as to how the additional 100,000 horsepower (75,000?kW) in capacity would be used, as there were virtually no customers for it.[17] When Abitibi was placed in receivership in 1932, legislation was passed over the following years to allow Ontario Hydro to take control of several Abitibi power developments.[a] Certain dealings relating to the 1933 acquisition came to be known as the \\"great Abitibi swindle,\\"[19] which resulted in the fall of the Henry government in the 1934 Ontario election, to be succeeded by that of Mitchell Hepburn.[19]\\r\\nIn 1939, the commission was given authority to regulate all other electricity generators, thus bringing all private utilities in the province under its supervision. It also received authority to acquire any utility that was not producing at its capacity.[20][21]\\r\\nIn 1948, HEPCO changed most of its system from 25?Hz to 60?Hz. However, the Fort Erie area south of Niagara Falls stayed on the remaining 25?Hz generators until 1966, and this area had electricity throughout the 1965 Eastern Seaboard Blackout.\\r\\nBy the 1950s the commission was operating as a single integrated system. As demand rose in the post-war period, Ontario Hydro started expanding its generation system bringing on line many new hydroelectric stations. In 1953, Ontario Hydro began to interconnect with other utilities, the first interconnection being the Keith-Waterman line in Windsor which crosses the Detroit River to Detroit, Michigan interconnecting with Detroit Edison in the United States. This line was originally constructed at 120,000 volts and was later upgraded to 230,000 volts in 1973. Shortly thereafter, other interconnections with New York State were built. The first coal-fired generating stations in the system were also built in this period. The expansion of coal continued during the 1960s and 1970s but was overtaken by the development of nuclear power.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1912, Adam Beck began to promote the creation and operation of electric interurban railways in the territory served by the commission, and the Legislative Assembly granted authority to do so in the Hydro-Electric Railway Act, 1914.[22] Changes in government policy and public sentiment in the 1920s restricted their development, and all such operations ceased in the 1930s (with the exception of the Hamilton Street Railway streetcar system, which continued until 1946).[23]\\r\\nIn the 1960s, HEPCO was the first utility in North America to utilize ultra-high voltage transmission lines. Planning for the UHV lines began in 1960 and in 1967, HEPCO put into service transmission lines carrying 500,000 volts that carry power from hydroelectric sources in remote Northern Ontario to high load areas in southern Ontario such as Toronto, London, and Ottawa. By 1970 all but the most remote municipal power systems in Ontario were organized into a single grid. During the 1970s and 1980s, Ontario Hydro gradually expanded the 500 kV transmission system into what it is today.\\r\\nBefore its own nuclear power stations started coming onstream, Ontario Hydro had the following capacity and output:[24]\\r\\nIn 1974, the commission was reconstituted as a crown corporation known as Ontario Hydro,[25] which had been the commission's nickname. In many Canadian provinces, including Ontario, hydroelectric power is so common that \\"hydro\\" has become synonymous with electric power regardless of the actual source of the electricity.\\r\\nIn the late 1950s, the corporation became involved in development, design and construction of CANDU nuclear power stations.\\r\\nIn 1965, the first commercial sized station came on line at Douglas Point.\\r\\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Ontario Hydro's nuclear generating program expanded with the building of the first four units of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station followed by stations at Bruce Nuclear Generating Station and a second four units at Pickering. By the late 1980s, Ontario Hydro operated one of the largest fleets of nuclear-powered generating stations in the world.\\r\\nThe Bruce Nuclear Generating Station became the largest nuclear generating station in the world in 2011 (and has remained the largest) by net electrical power rating, total reactor count, and number of operational reactors.\\r\\nThe last nuclear plant to be built in Ontario, Darlington Nuclear Generating Station, was planned in the 1970s. Construction started in 1981, but because of a series of political decision to delay construction, construction took an inordinately long time. Costs continued to mount during the delay and the plant was completed in 1993. This delay in the schedule caused the projected costs to increase tremendously, from an initial projected cost of $7.0 billion to $14.5 billion. The delay accounted for seventy percent of the cost increase.[26]\\r\\nThe quality of Hydro's management, given its size and scope of operations, has long been a concern. In 1922, Dougall Carmichael, then Minister without Portfolio, announced to the Legislature that he was quitting his position as Commissioner because Hydro \\"was either inefficient or dishonest.\\" He was forced to retract the allegation of dishonesty.[27]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, controversy arose relating to Hydro's expansion strategy, and several inquiries were held:\\r\\nIn the 1980s there were large increases in the rates charged, arising from:\\r\\nIn 1989, Ontario Hydro published a four-volume study, up to the year 2014, entitled Providing the Balance of Power, with different scenarios attempting to solve the need for additional facilities to replace aging electricity generation stations. This was derailed when electricity growth rates declined due to the recession of the early 1990s.\\r\\nIn 1998, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed the Energy Competition Act, 1998,[35] which:\\r\\nOntario Hydro ceased operations on March 31, 1999. Its assets and functions were transferred by provincial statute to two commercial successor corporations, Ontario Power Generation Inc. and Ontario Hydro Services Company Inc., as well as to two not-for-profit agencies, the Independent Electricity Market Operator and the Electrical Safety Authority.[37]\\r\\nOn March 31, 1999, Ontario Hydro reported in its financial statements that it had long term debts of $26.2 billion and assets totaling $39.6 billion.[38]\\r\\nThe fair value of its assets was substantially less than the $39.6 billion reported in the 1999 financial statements and therefore, in order to ensure the successor entities were financially solvent, the reorganization gave rise to $19.5 billion of stranded debt.[39] The stranded debt was the shortfall between the fair value of Ontario Hydro's assets and the value of Ontario Hydros total debt and other liabilities transferred to the new entities.[40]\\r\\nSince 2002, the stranded debt is being paid down through a Debt Retirement Charge levied upon Ontario ratepayers.[41][42][43] The Debt Retirement Charge is 0.7 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity consumed in Ontario.[44]\\r\\nAs of March 31, 2014, the remaining stranded debt was $2.6 billion.[45] Beginning in 2016, the Ontario government removed the Debt Retirement Charge from residential electricity users electricity bills. The charge will remain on all other electricity users bills until the remaining stranded debt is retired.[46] The Debt Retirement Charge is expected to terminate on April 1, 2018.[47]","input":"When did the separation of ontario hydro occur?"},{"output":"Angela Alioto","context":"On June 5, 2018, a special election will be held for Mayor of the City and County of San Francisco.

Such rocks are exposed on the Earth's surface in very few places. Some of the oldest surface rock can be found in the Canadian Shield, Australia, Africa and in a few other old regions around the world. The ages of these felsic rocks are generally between 2.5 and 3.8 billion years. The approximate ages have a margin of error of millions of years. In 1999, the oldest known rock on Earth was dated to 4.031 I0.003 billion years, and is part of the Acasta Gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada.[1] Researchers at McGill University found a rock with a very old model age for extraction from the mantle (3.8 to 4.28 billion years ago) in the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt on the coast of Hudson Bay, in northern Quebec;[2] the true age of these samples is still under debate, and they may actually be closer to 3.8 billion years old.[3] Older than these rocks are crystals of the mineral zircon, which can survive the disaggregation of their parent rock and be found and dated in younger rock formations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest material of terrestrial origin that has been dated is a zircon mineral of 4.404 I0.008 Ga enclosed in a metamorphosed sandstone conglomerate in the Jack Hills of the Narryer Gneiss Terrane of Western Australia.[4] The 4.404 I0.008 Ga zircon is a slight outlier, with the oldest consistently-dated zircon falling closer to 4.35 Ga.[5] This zircon is part of a population of zircons within the metamorphosed conglomerate, which is believed to have been deposited about 3.060?Ga, which is the age of the youngest detrital zircon in the rock. Recent developments in atom-probe tomography have led to a further constraint on the age of the oldest continental zircon, with the most recent age quoted as 4.374 Ga I0.006.[6]\\r\\nThe oldest rock formation is, depending on the latest research, either part of the Isua Greenstone Belt, Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt, or the Acasta Gneiss (on the Slave craton). The difficulty in assigning the title to one particular block of gneiss is that the gneisses are all extremely deformed, and the oldest rock may be represented by only one streak of minerals in a mylonite, representing a layer of sediment or an old dike. This may be difficult to find or map; hence, the oldest dates yet resolved are as much generated by luck in sampling as by understanding the rocks themselves.\\r\\nIt is thus premature to claim that any of these rocks, or indeed that of other formations of Hadean gneisses, is the oldest formations or rocks on Earth; doubtless, new analyses will continue to change our conceptions of the structure and nature of these ancient continental fragments.\\r\\nNevertheless, the oldest cratons on Earth include the Kaapvaal craton, the Western Gneiss Terrane of the Yilgarn craton (~2.9 ÿ >3.2 Ga), the Pilbara Craton (~3.4 Ga), and portions of the Canadian Shield (~2.4 ÿ >3.6 Ga). Parts of the poorly studied Dharwar craton in India are greater than 3.0 Ga. The oldest dated rocks of the Baltic Shield are 3.5 Ga old.[7]\\r\\nThe Acasta Gneiss in the Canadian Shield in the Northwest Territories, Canada is composed of the Archaean igneous and gneissic cores of ancient mountain chains that have been exposed in a glacial peneplain. Analyses of zircons from a felsic orthogneiss with presumed granitic protolith returned an age of 4.031 I0.003 Ga.[1]\\r\\nOn September 25, 2008, researchers from McGill University, Carnegie Institution for Science and UQAM announced that a rock formation, the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt, exposed on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay in northern Quebec had a Sm-Nd model age for extraction from the mantle of 4.28 billion years.[8][9][10][11] However, it is argued that the actual age of formation of this rock, as opposed to the extraction of its magma from the mantle, is likely closer to 3.8 billion years, according to Simon Wilde of the Institute for Geoscience Research in Australia.[3]\\r\\nThe zircons from the Western Australian Jack Hills returned an age of 4.404 billion years, interpreted to be the age of crystallization. These zircons also show another interesting feature; their oxygen isotopic composition has been interpreted to indicate that more than 4.4 billion years ago there was already water on the surface of the Earth. The importance and accuracy of these interpretations is currently the subject of scientific debate. It may be that the oxygen isotopes and other compositional features (the rare-earth elements) record more recent hydrothermal alteration of the zircons rather than the composition of the magma at the time of their original crystallization.[citation needed] In a paper published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, a team of scientists suggest that rocky continents and liquid water existed at least 4.3 billion years ago and were subjected to heavy weathering by an acrid climate. Using an ion microprobe to analyze isotope ratios of the element lithium in zircons from the Jack Hills in Western Australia, and comparing these chemical fingerprints to lithium compositions in zircons from continental crust and primitive rocks similar to the Earth's mantle, they found evidence that the young planet already had the beginnings of continents, relatively cool temperatures and liquid water by the time the Australian zircons formed.[12]\\r\\nOne of the oldest Martian meteorites found on Earth, ALH84001, discovered in the Allan Hills of Antarctica, has been reported to have crystallized from molten rock 4.091 billion years ago.[13]\\r\\nThe Genesis Rock, (Lunar sample 15415) obtained from the Moon by astronauts during Apollo 15 mission, has been dated at 4.08 billion years.[14] During Apollo 16, older rocks, including Lunar sample 67215, dated at 4.46 billion years, were brought back.[15] Lunar sample 67215 is the oldest known rock on Earth, even though it originated on the Moon.","input":"Of what type are the oldest surviving rocks on earth?"},{"output":"continental shelf","context":"The continental margin is of the three major zones of the ocean floor, the other two being deep-ocean basins and mid-ocean ridges. The continental margin is the shallow water area found in proximity to continent.[1]   The continental margin consists of three different features: the continental rise, the continental slope, and the continental shelf.[2] Continental margins constitute about 28% of the oceanic area.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe continental shelf is the portion of the continental margin that transitions from the shore out towards to ocean. They are believed to make up 7 percent of the sea floor.[3] The width of continental shelves worldwide varies from a 30 meters to 1500 kilometers.[4] It is generally flat, and ends at the shelf break, where there is a drastic increase in slope angle. The mean slope of continental shelves worldwide is 0 07 degrees, and typically steeper closer to the coastline than it is near the shelf break.[5] At the shelf break begins the continental slope, which can be one to five kilometers above the deep-ocean floor. The continental slope often exhibits features called submarine canyons.[4] Submarine canyons often cut into the continental shelves deeply, with near vertical slopes, and continue to cut the morphology to the abyssal plain.[5] The valleys are often V-shaped, and can sometime enlarge onto the continental shelf. At the base of the continental slope, there is a sudden decrease in slope, and the sea floor begins to level out towards the abyssal plain. This portion of the seafloor is called the continental rise, and marks the end of the continental margin.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two types of continental margins: active and passive margins.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nActive margins are typically associated with lithospheric plate boundaries. These active margins can be convergent or transform margins, and are also places of high tectonic activity, including volcanoes and earthquakes. The West Coast of North America and South America is considered an active margin.[4] Active continental margins are typically narrow from coast to shelf break, with steep descents into trenches.[4] Convergent active margins occur where oceanic plates meet continental plates. The denser oceanic plate subducts below the less dense continental plate. Convergent active margins are the most common type of active margin. Transform active margins are more rare, and occur when an oceanic plate and a continental plate are moving parallel to each other in opposite directions. These transform margins are often characterized by many offshore faults, which causes high degree of relief offshore, marked by islands, shallow banks, and deep basins. This is known as the continental borderland.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nPassive margins are often located in the interior of lithospheric plates, away from the plate boundaries, and lack major tectonic activity. They often face mid-ocean ridges.[3] The East Coast of the United States is an example of a passive margin. These margins are much wider and less sloped than active margins.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs continental crust weathers and erodes, it degrades into mainly sands and clays. Many of these particles end up in streams and rivers that then dump into the ocean. Of all the sediment in the stream load, 80% is then trapped and dispersed on continental margins.[3] While modern river sediment is often still preserved closer to shore, continental shelves show high levels of  glacial and relict sediments, deposited when sea level was lower.[3] Often found on passive margins are several kilometers of sediment, consisting of terrigenous and carbonate (biogenous) deposits. These sediment reservoirs are often useful in the study of paleoceanography and the original formation of ocean basins.[3] These deposits are often not well preserved on active margin shelves due to tectonic activity.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomically, the continental shelf is the most economically valuable part of the ocean. It often is the most productive portion of the continental margin, as well as the most studied portion, due to its relatively shallow, accessible depths.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the rise of offshore drilling, mining and the limitations of fisheries off the continental shelf, the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea was established. The edge of the continental margin is one criterion for the boundary of the internationally recognized claims to underwater resources by countries in the definition of the \\"continental shelf\\" by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (although in the UN definition the \\"legal continental shelf\\" may extend beyond the geomorphological continental shelf and vice versa).[1] Such resources include fishing grounds, oil and gas accumulations, sand, gravel, and some heavy minerals in the shallower areas of the margin. Metallic minerals resources are thought to also be associated with certain active margins, and of great value.[3]","input":"What is the region beyond the continental margin?"},{"output":"in males convey the spermatic cords","context":"The inguinal canals are the two passages in the anterior abdominal wall which in males convey the spermatic cords and in females the round ligament of uterus.

Thus lymphatic spread from a testicular tumour is to the para-aortic nodes first, and not the inguinal nodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe structures which pass through the canals differ between males and females:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe classic description of the contents of the spermatic cords in the male are:\\r\\n\\r\\n3 arteries: artery to vas deferens (or ductus deferens), testicular artery, cremasteric artery;\\r\\n\\r\\n3 fascial layers: external spermatic, cremasteric, and internal spermatic fascia;\\r\\n\\r\\n3 other structures: pampiniform plexus, vas deferens (ductus deferens), testicular lymphatics;\\r\\n\\r\\n3 nerves: genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve (L1/2), sympathetic and visceral afferent fibres, ilioinguinal nerve (N.B. outside spermatic cord but travels next to it)\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that the ilioinguinal nerve passes through the superficial ring to descend into the scrotum, but does not formally run through the canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdominal contents (potentially including intestine) can be abnormally displaced from the abdominal cavity. Where these contents exit through the inguinal canal, having passed through the deep inguinal ring, the condition is known as an indirect or oblique inguinal hernia. This can also cause infertility. This condition is far more common in males than in females, owing to the inguinal canal's small size in females.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hernia that exits the abdominal cavity directly through the deep layers of the abdominal wall, thereby bypassing the inguinal canal, is known as a direct inguinal hernia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn males with strong presentation of the cremasteric reflex, the testes can--during supine sexual activity or manual manipulation--partially or fully retract into the inguinal canal for a short period of time. In juveniles and adults with inguinal injury, retraction can be prolonged and potentially lead to overheating-related infertility.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spermatic cord in the inguinal canal.\\r\\n\\r\\nInguinal fossae\\r\\n\\r\\n^ Adam Mitchell; Drake, Richard; Gray, Henry David; Wayne Vogl (2010).

With a population of about 2,340,000, it ranks as the second largest metropolitan area with its core in Missouri (after Greater St. Louis). Alongside Kansas City, the area includes a number of other cities and suburbs, the largest being Overland Park, Kansas; Kansas City, Kansas; Olathe, Kansas; and Independence, Missouri; each over 100,000 in population. The Mid-America Regional Council (MARC) serves as the Council of Governments and the Metropolitan Planning Organization for the area.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe larger Kansas City Metropolitan Area as seen on a map can be visualized roughly as four quadrants:\\r\\nThe map's northeast quadrant is locally referred to as \\"north of the river\\" or \\"the Northland\\". It includes parts of Clay County, Missouri including North Kansas City, Missouri. North Kansas City is bounded by a bend in the Missouri River that defines a border between Wyandotte County, Kansas and Clay County, Missouri running approximately North-South and a border between North Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Missouri running approximately East-West. The river band's sharpest part forms a peninsula containing the Kansas City Downtown Airport.\\r\\nThe southeast quadrant includes Kansas City, Missouri and surrounding areas in Missouri. It includes the notorious Grandview Triangle.\\r\\nThe southwest quadrant includes all of Johnson County, Kansas, which includes the towns in the area known as Shawnee Mission, Kansas. Interstate 35 runs diagonally through Johnson County, Kansas from the southwest to downtown Kansas City, Missouri.\\r\\nThe northwest quadrant contains Wyandotte County, Kansas and parts of Platte County, Missouri. Wyandotte County, Kansas, sometimes referred to as just Wyandotte, which contains Kansas City, Kansas, Bonner Springs, Kansas and Edwardsville, Kansas is governed by a single unified government. Often the Wyandotte government is referred to simply as \\"The Unified Government\\". Another bend in the Missouri River forms the county line between Wyandotte County, Kansas and Platte County, Missouri to the north and northeast.\\r\\nDowntown almost always refers to downtown Kansas City, Missouri. Downtown is the Kansas City's historic center, located entirely within Kansas City, Missouri, and containing the city's original town site, business districts and residential neighborhoods. Downtown is bounded by the Missouri River on the north, the Missouri-Kansas state line on the west, 31st Street on the south and the Blue River on the east. The downtown area includes the Central Business District and its buildings, which form the city's skyline. The downtown loop is formed by Interstates 670, 70 and 35. Within the downtown loop are many of the tall buildings and skyscrapers that make up the city's skyline. Also within the downtown loop are small, distinct neighborhoods such as Quality Hill, the Garment District, the Financial District, the Convention Center District, and the Power and Light District.\\r\\nOther neighborhoods within downtown are the River Market and Columbus Park, both located between the downtown loop and the Missouri River. Between the downtown loop and the state line are the Westside neighborhood and the West Bottoms, located at the bottom of the bluff adjacent to Kaw Point. East of the loop are the 18th & Vine District, the North Bottoms, East Bottoms, Northeast, and Pendleton Heights. South of the loop is the Crossroads District, Union Hill, Crown Center, Hospital Hill, Longfellow, Wendell Phillips, and Washington Wheatley.\\r\\nThe Kansas City Convention Center, Municipal Auditorium, City Hall, Lyric Theater, Midland Theatre, Ilus Davis Park, and Barney Allis Plaza are within the Central Business District inside the downtown loop. The Sprint Center and the College Basketball Experience are within Power & Light District, also within the downtown loop. The Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts is perched upon a high point immediately south of the downtown loop. South of the loop is the Crossroads District, Union Station, Crown Center, the National World War I Museum, Liberty Memorial, Penn Valley Park, Truman Medical Center, Children's Mercy Hospital, and the 18th & Vine District. North of the loop are City Market within the River Market and Richard L. Berkeley Riverfront Park. West of the loop within the West Bottoms are Kemper Arena and Hale Arena.\\r\\nMidtown is entirely within Kansas City, Missouri, just south of downtown, and bounded by 31st Street on the north, the state line on the west, West Gregory Boulevard (71st Street) on the south, and Troost Avenue on the east. Midtown is the core of the metropolitan area, as it contains numerous cultural attractions, shopping and entertainment areas, large hospitals, universities, and the metro area's most densely populated neighborhoods.\\r\\nMidtown consists of numerous distinct and historic neighborhoods such as Westport, Hyde Park, and Southmoreland. Shopping is centered on the Country Club Plaza, which contains numerous luxury retailers, hotels, and restaurants. Brookside and Westport also contain smaller-scale, neighborhood-oriented, and niche-market retailers. Midtown is home to Saint Luke's Hospital and Research Medical Center. Cultural attractions include the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Uptown Theater, Starlight Theater, the Kansas City Zoo, Loose Park, and Swope Park. The last of these contains a soccer complex that is home to FC Kansas City of the National Women's Soccer League and the Swope Park Rangers, a United Soccer League team that is the official reserve side for the area's Major League Soccer club, Sporting Kansas City. Major educational institutions include the University of Missouri-Kansas City, Rockhurst University, Kansas City Art Institute, Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Midwest Research Institute, and Penn Valley Community College.\\r\\nAlso known as \\"South Kansas City\\", this area consists of the southern half of Kansas City, Missouri, as well as the suburbs of Grandview, Harrisonville, Belton, Loch Lloyd, Peculiar and Raymore.\\r\\nThe Northland is the area north of the Missouri River, bordered by the Kansas state line on the west and Missouri Highway 291 on the east. The southern half of Platte County, and much of Clay County make up the area. The economy of the Northland is dominated by Kansas City International Airport, Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant, the Zona Rosa shopping community and three riverboat casinos. The metro area's largest amusement park, Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun, is located in the Northland. Communities of the Northland outside the city limits include Parkville, Kearney, Liberty, Platte City, Gladstone , Riverside, Smithville, and North Kansas City.\\r\\nEast Side of the Metro is primarily eastern Jackson County which is an area of the Kansas City Metro that contains the far-eastern urban side of Kansas City, Missouri and the following large suburbs of Blue Springs, Independence, and Lee's Summit. Also included in this area is western Lafayette County Missouri and the far northeast portion of Cass County Missouri. The East Side of Metro includes the following Missouri suburbs of Independence, Blue Springs, Raytown, Lees Summit, Grain Valley, Oak Grove, Sugar Creek, River Bend, Lake Lotawana, Lone Jack, Greenwood, Unity Village, Buckner, Pleasant Hill, Bates City, Odessa, and Lake Tapawingo. Arrowhead Stadium, home of the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs and Kauffman Stadium, home of the MLB's Kansas City Royals are located on the eastern edge of Kansas City. The Silverstein Eye Centers Arena home of the ECHL's Missouri Mavericks and the MASL's Missouri Comets is located in Independence.\\r\\nIn Wyandotte County lies Kansas City, Kansas, which is locally called \\"KCK\\" to distinguish it from the larger Kansas City, Missouri (KCMO). It contains many residential neighborhoods, the Fairfax Industrial District, and the Village West entertainment district. The General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant is located in the Fairfax Industrial District. Village West contains many area attractions. This includes many sporting venues such as Children's Mercy Park, home of the area MLS soccer team Sporting Kansas City, the Kansas Speedway, which hosts many NASCAR races, and Community America Ballpark, home of the independent baseball team, the Kansas City T-Bones. Other Village West attractions include the Legends shopping district, the Providence Medical Center Amphitheater, and Schlitterbahn Waterpark.\\r\\nJohnson County, Kansas is home to many local suburbs. These suburbs include Overland Park, Olathe, Shawnee, Leawood, Lenexa, Prairie Village, Gardner, Merriam, Mission, Roeland Park, Fairway, Lake Quivira, Mission Hills, Mission Woods, Westwood, and Westwood Hills. Many local area attractions and shopping districts are located in Johnson County, such as Oak Park Mall, Town Center Plaza, and Prairie Fire.\\r\\nIn recent years, the Kansas City metropolitan area has been experiencing continued growth. Between July 2000 and July 2007, the population of the Kansas City MSA grew from 1,842,965 to an estimated 2,037,357, an increase of 10%.[1]\\r\\nThe MSA covers a total area of 7,952?sq?mi (20,600?km2) including 97?sq?mi (250?km2) of water.\\r\\nOften associated with Kansas City, the cities of Lawrence, Kansas, and St. Joseph, Missouri, are identified as separate Metropolitan Statistical Areas.[2]\\r\\nThe Kansas City-Overland Park-Kansas City, Missouri-Kansas Combined Statistical Area, which encompasses the Kansas City MO-KS MSA, the Warrensburg, Missouri Micropolitan Statistical Area (SA) (in Johnson County, Missouri), and the Atchison, Kansas SA (in Atchison County, Kansas), covers a total area of 9,220?sq?mi (23,900?km2) including 103?sq?mi (270?km2) of water.\\r\\nThe Kansas City metropolitan area has more freeway lane miles per capita than any other large metropolitan area in the United States (over 27% more than the second-place Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex), over 50% more than the average American metro area, and nearly 75% more than the large metro area with the least: Las Vegas.[3]\\r\\nThe Kansas City area is a confluence of four major U.S. interstate highways:\\r\\nOther interstates that cross through the area include:\\r\\nU.S. Highways serving the Kansas City Metro Area include:\\r\\nKansas highways in the area include:\\r\\nMissouri highways in the area include:\\r\\nOther notable roads in the area are:\\r\\nThe Kansas City metropolitan area is served by several airports. It is primarily served by Kansas City International Airport, located 15 miles northwest of downtown Kansas City, Missouri, was built to serve as a world hub for the supersonic transport and Boeing 747. The airport's gates were positioned 100 feet (30?m) from the street; however, since the September 11, 2001 attacks, these have undergone expensive overhauls, retrofitting it to incorporate elements of conventional security systems.\\r\\nThe much smaller Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport, located to the immediate north of downtown near the Missouri River, was the original headquarters of Trans World Airlines (TWA) and houses the Airline History Museum. It served as the area's major airport until 1972, when Kansas City International (then known as Mid-Continent International Airport and was home to an Overhaul Base for TWA) became the primary airport for the metropolitan area after undergoing $150 million in upgrades that were approved by voters in a 1966 bond issue. Downtown Airport is still used to this day for general aviation and airshows.\\r\\nThere are two general aviation airports in Johnson County, Kansas. New Century AirCenter borders southwest Olathe and northeast Gardner. The primary runway at New Century AirCenter is the second longest runway in the region next to those at Kansas City International Airport. It is located 7 miles from the Logistics Park Kansas City Intermodal Facility. The other airport, Johnson County Executive Airport has one runway on 500 acres and is the fourth busiest towered airport in the state of Kansas.\\r\\nUnion Station serves as a hub for Amtrak, which maintains daily service by long-distance trains to and from Kansas City, Missouri.\\r\\nPublic transportation in the Kansas City area is only provided by city buses operated by the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA). The Metro Area Express (MAX) went online as Kansas City, Missouri's first bus rapid transit line in July 2005, and operates and is marketed akin to a rail system as opposed to a local bus line; the MAX links the River Market, Downtown, Union Station, Crown Center and the Country Club Plaza.[4][5] Buses in Johnson County, Kansas, are operated by Johnson County Transit (known as \\"The JO\\").\\r\\nThe Kansas City Downtown Streetcar is a 2.2-mile modern streetcar line in downtown Kansas City opened to the public in May 2016, and is maintained and operated by the Kansas City Streetcar Authority, a non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees. A ballot initiative to fund construction of the $102 million line was approved by voters on December 12, 2012.[6] The system will run between River Market and Union Station, mostly on Main Street,[7] with extensions to the starter line planned for addition at a later date.\\r\\nSee related article: voy:Kansas City (Missouri) at Wikivoyage\\r\\nThe Missouri side of the metropolitan area shares a grid system with Johnson County on the Kansas side. Most east-west streets are numbered and most north-south streets named. Addresses on east-west streets are numbered from Main Street in Kansas City, Missouri, and on north-south streets from St. John Avenue (or the Missouri River, in the River Market area). The direction 'South' in street and address numbers is generally implied if 'North' is not specified, except for numbered 'avenues' in North Kansas City. In the northland, east-west streets use the prefix N.E. or N.W., depending on the side of N. Main on which they lie.\\r\\nOther nearby institutions:\\r\\nThe Kansas City Star is the metropolitan area's major daily newspaper. The McClatchy Company, which owns The Star, is also the owner of two suburban weeklies, Lee's Summit Journal and Olathe Journal.\\r\\nThe Kansas City Kansan serves Wyandotte County, having moved from print to an online format in 2009. Additional weekly papers in the metropolitan area include the Liberty Tribune, Sun Newspapers of Johnson County, The Examiner in Independence and eastern Jackson County, and The Pitch. The area is also served by two newspapers focused the area's faith-based population: The Metro Voice Christian Newspaper and the Jewish Chronicle. The city's Hispanic and Latino American community is served by Dos Mundos, a bilingual newspaper with articles printed in Spanish and English, and Mi Raza magazine, the area's only weekly Hispanic publication printed in Spanish. The Kansas City Call serves the African American community publishing its paper weekly.\\r\\nAccording to Arbitron, about 1.5 million people over the age of 12 live within the Kansas City DMA, making it the 30th largest market for radio and 31st for television according to Nielsen.

Although not an officially established language of the whole country, English is considered the de facto language and is given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments.[7][8] As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of Puerto Rico, under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States district court for the territory.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of English in the United States is a result of English and British colonization of the Americas. The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since then, American English has developed into new dialects, in some cases under the influence of West African and Native American languages, German, Dutch, Irish, Spanish, and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican English varieties form a linguistic continuum of dialects more similar to each other than to English dialects of other countries, including some common pronunciations and other features found nationwide.[10] Any North American English accent perceived as free of noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural markers is popularly called \\"General\\" or \\"Standard\\" American, a fairly uniform standard of broadcast mass media and the highly educated. Otherwise, according to Labov, with the major exception of Southern American English, regional accents throughout the country are not yielding to this standard,[11] and historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single \\"mainstream\\" American accent.[12][13] On the contrary, the sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents emerging.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile written American English is largely standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary. The regional sounds of present-day American English are reportedly engaged in a complex phenomenon of \\"both convergence and divergence\\": some accents are homogenizing and levelling, while others are diversifying and deviating further away from one another.[15] In 2010, William Labov summarized the current state of regional American accents as follows:[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome regional American English has undergone \\"vigorous new sound changes\\" since the mid-nineteenth century onwards, spawning relatively recent Mid-Atlantic (centered on Philadelphia and Baltimore), Western Pennsylvania (centered on Pittsburgh), Inland Northern (centered on Chicago, Detroit, and the Great Lakes region), Midland (centered on Indianapolis, Columbus, and Kansas City) and Western regional accents, all of which \\"are now more different from each other than they were fifty or a hundred years ago\\". Meanwhile, distinguishing features of the Eastern New England (centered on Boston) and New York City accents appear to be stable. \\"On the other hand, dialects of many smaller cities have receded in favor of the new regional patterns\\";[16] for example, the traditional accents of Charleston and of Cincinnati have given way to the Midland regional accent, and of St. Louis now approaches the sounds of an Inland Northern or Midland accent. At the same time, the Southern regional accent, despite the huge population it covers,[14] \\"is on the whole slowly receding due to cultural stigma: younger speakers everywhere in the South are shifting away from the marked features of Southern speech\\". Finally, the \\"Hoi Toider\\" dialect shows the paradox of receding among younger speakers in the islands of North Carolina's Outer Banks, yet strengthening in the islands of the Chesapeake Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Western dialect, including Californian and New Mexican sub-types (with Pacific Northwest English also, arguably, a sub-type), is defined by:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North Central (\\"Upper Midwest\\") dialect, including an Upper Michigan sub-type, is defined by:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inland Northern (\\"Great Lakes\\") dialect, including its less advanced Western New England (WNE) sub-types, is defined by:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Midland dialect is defined by:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Western Pennsylvania dialect, including its advanced Pittsburgh sub-type, is defined by:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Southern dialects, including several sub-types, are defined by:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mid-Atlantic (\\"Delaware Valley\\") dialect, including Philadelphia and Baltimore sub-types, is defined by:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York City dialect (with New Orleans English an intermediate sub-type between NYC and Southern) is defined by:\\r\\n\\r\\nEastern New England dialect, including Maine and Boston sub-types (with Rhode Island English an intermediate sub-type between ENE and NYC), is defined by:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow, eleven major American English accents are defined by their particular combinations of certain characteristics:\\r\\n\\r\\nMarked New England speech is mostly associated with eastern New England, centering on Boston and Providence, and traditionally includes some notable degree of r-dropping (or non-rhoticity),[29] as well as the back tongue positioning of the /u?/ vowel (to [u]) and the /a?/ vowel (to [?~??]).[30] In and north of Boston, the /?r/ sound is famously centralized or even fronted. Boston shows a cotÿcaught merger, while Providence keeps the same two vowels sharply distinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York City English prevails in a relatively small but nationally recognizable dialect region in and around New York City, including Long Island and northeastern New Jersey. The New York accent includes some notable degree of non-rhoticity and a locally unique short-a vowel pronunciation split. New York City English otherwise broadly follows Northern patterns, except that the /a?/ vowel is fronted. The cotÿcaught merger is markedly resisted in the New York metropolitan area, as depicted in popular stereotypes like tawwk and cawwfee, with this THOUGHT vowel being typically tensed and diphthongal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost older Southern speech along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts was non-rhotic, though, today, almost all Southern dialects are rhotic, and even \\"hyper-rhotic\\",[33] with a very strongly enunciated, \\"bunched-tongue\\" r sound. The modern accent is defined most recognizably by the /a?/ vowel losing its gliding quality to approach [a?~??], the initiation event for the Southern Vowel Shift. This vowel shift involves the \\"Southern drawl\\" that makes short front vowels into distinct-sounding gliding vowels.[25] The most advanced sub-varieties exist in the southern Appalachian cities and certain areas of Texas. Non-Southern Americans tend to stereotype Southern accents negatively, associating them with slowness, lack of education, bigotry, and religious or political conservatism,[34] with labels for the accent such as \\"hick\\" or \\"hillbilly\\".[35] Meanwhile, Southerners themselves tend to have mixed judgments of their own accents, some negative but some positively associated with a laid-back, plain, or humble attitude.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the mid-twentieth century, a distinctive new Northern speech pattern has developed near the Canadian border of the United States, centered on the central and eastern Great Lakes region (but only on the American side). Linguists call this region the \\"Inland North\\", as defined by its Northern Cities Vowel Shift (/?/ raising, /?/ fronting, and other vowel changes), occurring in the same region whose \\"standard Midwestern\\" speech was the basis for General American in the mid-twentieth century, though prior to the full Northern Cities Vowel Shift. The Inland Northern accent was lampooned on the television show Saturday Night Live's \\"Bill Swerski's Superfans\\" segments, though the accent's shift may be reversing in certain communities.[37][38] Many people view the \\"North Central\\" or \\"Upper Midwestern\\" accent, another Northern accent, from the stereotypical lens of the movie Fargo.[39] The North Central accent is characterized by a more common cot-caught merger and influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the traditional American dialect areas of the \\"North\\" and \\"South\\" is what linguists have long called the \\"Midland\\" encompassing states situated in the lower Midwest, beginning west of the Appalachian Mountains. The vocabulary of its older speakers was divided into two discrete subdivisions, the \\"North Midland\\" that begins north of the Ohio River valley area, and the \\"South Midland\\" speech, which to the average American ear has a slight trace of the \\"Southern accent\\" (especially due to some degree of /a?/ glide weakening). Modern Midland speech is transitional between a presence and absence of the cotÿcaught merger. Historically, Pennsylvania was a home of the Midland dialect; however, this state of early English-speaking settlers has now largely split off into new dialect regions, with distinct Philadelphia and Pittsburgh dialects documented since the middle of the twentieth century.\\r\\n\\r\\nA generalized Midland speech continues westward until becoming a somewhat internally diverse Western American English that unites the entire western half of the country, mostly unified by a firm cotÿcaught merger and a conservatively backed pronunciation of the long oh sound in goat, toe, show, etc., but a fronted pronunciation of the long oo sound in goose, lose, tune, etc. Western speech itself contains such advanced sub-types as Pacific Northwest English and California English, with the native-speaker English of Mexican Americans also being a sub-type primarily of the Western dialect. The island state of Hawaii, though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a creole language known commonly as Hawaiian Pidgin, and some Hawaii residents speak English with a Pidgin-influenced accent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough no longer region-specific,[40] African-American Vernacular English, which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class African Americans, has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including hip hop culture. Hispanic and Latino Americans have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are Chicano English, spoken in the West and Midwest, and New York Latino English, spoken in the New York metropolitan area. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as Yeshiva English and \\"Yinglish\\" are spoken by some American Jews, Cajun Vernacular English by some Cajuns in southern Louisiana, Pennsylvania Dutch English by some Pennsylvania Dutch in Pennsylvania and the Midwest, and American Indian Englishes have been documented among diverse Indian tribes.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompared with English as spoken in England, North American English[41] is more homogeneous, and any North American accent that exhibits a majority of the most common phonological features is known as \\"General American\\". This section mostly refers to such widespread or mainstream pronunciation features that characterize American English.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies on historical usage of English in both the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply deviate away from period British English, but retained certain now-archaic features contemporary British English has since lost.[42] One of these is the rhoticity common in most American accents, because in the 17th century, when English was brought to the Americas, most English in England was also rhotic. The preservation of rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of Hiberno-English, West Country English and Scottish English.[43] In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter ?r? is a postalveolar approximant [??] or retroflex approximant [?] rather than a trill or tap (as often heard, for example, in the English accents of Scotland or India). A unique \\"bunched tongue\\" variant of the approximant r sound is also associated with the United States, and seems particularly noticeable in the Midwest and South.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, the \\"East Coast\\" comprises three or four major linguistically distinct regions, each of which possesses English varieties both distinct from each other as well as quite internally diverse: New England, the New York metropolitan area, the Mid-Atlantic states (centering on Philadelphia and Baltimore), and the Southern United States. The only traditionally r-dropping (or non-rhotic) regional accents of American English are all spoken along the Atlantic Coast and parts of the Gulf Coast (particularly still in Louisiana), because these areas were in close historical contact with England and imitated prestigious varieties of r-dropping London (a feature now widespread throughout most of England) at a time when they were undergoing changes.[46] Today, non-rhoticity is confined in the United States to the accents of eastern New England, New York City, older speakers of the former plantation South, and African-American Vernacular English (though the vowel-consonant cluster found in \\"bird\\", \\"work\\", \\"hurt\\", \\"learn\\", etc. usually retains its r pronunciation, even in these non-rhotic accents). Other than these few varieties, American accents are rhotic, pronouncing every instance of the ?r? sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany British accents have evolved in other ways compared to which General American English has remained relatively more conservative, for example, regarding the typical southern British features of a trapÿbath split, fronting of /o?/, and H-dropping, none of which typical American accents show. The innovation of /t/ glottaling, which does occur before a consonant (including a syllabic coronal nasal consonant, like in the words button or satin) and word-finally in General American, additionally occurs variably between vowels in British English. On the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:\\r\\n\\r\\nSome mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe process of coining new lexical items started as soon as English-speaking British-American colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the Native American languages.[62] Examples of such names are opossum, raccoon, squash, moose (from Algonquian),[62] wigwam, and moccasin. The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, cookie, from Dutch; kindergarten from German,[63] levee from French; and rodeo from Spanish.[64][65][66][67] Landscape features are often loanwords from French or Spanish, and the word corn, used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the maize plant, the most important crop in the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Mexican Spanish contributions came after the War of 1812, with the opening of the West, like ranch (now a common house style). New forms of dwelling created new terms (lot, waterfront) and types of homes like log cabin, adobe in the 18th century; apartment, shanty in the 19th century; project, condominium, townhouse, mobile home in the 20th century; and parts thereof (driveway, breezeway, backyard).[citation needed] Industry and material innovations from the 19th century onwards provide distinctive new words, phrases, and idioms through railroading (see further at rail terminology) and transportation terminology, ranging from types of roads (dirt roads, freeways) to infrastructure (parking lot, overpass, rest area), to automotive terminology often now standard in English internationally.[68] Already existing English wordssuch as store, shop, lumberunderwent shifts in meaning; others remained in the U.S. while changing in Britain. From the world of business and finance came new terms (merger, downsize, bottom line), from sports and gambling terminology came, specific jargon aside, common everyday American idioms, including many idioms related to baseball. The names of some American inventions remained largely confined to North America (elevator, gasoline) as did certain automotive terms (truck, trunk).\\r\\n\\r\\nNew foreign loanwords came with 19th and early 20th century European immigration to the U.S.; notably, from Yiddish (chutzpah, schmooze) and German (hamburger, wiener).[69][70] A large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from OK and cool to nerd and 24/7), while others have not (have a nice day, for sure);[71][72] many are now distinctly old-fashioned (swell, groovy). Some English words now in general use, such as hijacking, disc jockey, boost, bulldoze and jazz, originated as American slang.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican English has always shown a marked tendency to use nouns as verbs.[73] Examples of nouns that are now also verbs are interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, bad-mouth, vacation, major, and many others. Compounds coined in the U.S. are for instance foothill, landslide (in all senses), backdrop, teenager,\\r\\nbrainstorm, bandwagon, hitchhike, smalltime, and a huge number of others. Some are euphemistic (human resources, affirmative action, correctional facility). Many compound nouns have the verb-and-preposition combination: stopover, lineup, tryout, spin-off, shootout, holdup, hideout, comeback, makeover, and many more. Some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin (win out, hold up, back up/off/down/out, face up to and many others).[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nNoun endings such as -ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster) and -cian (beautician) are also particularly productive in the U.S.[73] Several verbs ending in -ize are of U.S. origin; for example, fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, weatherize, etc; and so are some back-formations (locate, fine-tune, curate, donate, emote, upholster and enthuse). Among syntactical constructions that arose are outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, etc. Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably pesky, phony, rambunctious, buddy, sundae, skeeter, sashay and kitty-corner. Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are, for example, lengthy, bossy, cute and cutesy, punk (in all senses), sticky (of the weather), through (as in \\"finished\\"), and many colloquial forms such as peppy or wacky.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of words and meanings that originated in Middle English or Early Modern English and that have been in everyday use in the United States have since disappeared in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in Lowland Scots. Terms such as fall (\\"autumn\\"), faucet (\\"tap\\"), diaper (\\"nappy\\"), candy (\\"sweets\\"), skillet, eyeglasses, and obligate are often regarded as Americanisms. Fall for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like \\"fall of the leaf\\" and \\"fall of the year\\".[75] Gotten (past participle of get) is often considered to be largely an Americanism.[76] Other words and meanings were brought back to Britain from the U.S., especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include hire (\\"to employ\\"), I guess (famously criticized by H. W. Fowler), baggage, hit (a place), and the adverbs overly and presently (\\"currently\\"). Some of these, for example, monkey wrench and wastebasket, originated in 19th century Britain. The adjectives mad meaning \\"angry\\", smart meaning \\"intelligent\\", and sick meaning \\"ill\\" are also more frequent in American (and Irish) English than British English.[77][78][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinguist Bert Vaux created a survey, completed in 2003, polling English speakers across the United States about their specific everyday word choices, hoping to identify regionalisms.[80] The study found that most Americans prefer the term sub for a long sandwich, soda (but pop in the Great Lakes region and generic coke in the South) for a sweet and bubbly soft drink,[81] you or you guys for the plural of you (but y'all in the South), sneakers for athletic shoes (but often tennis shoes outside the Northeast), and shopping cart for a cart used for carrying supermarket goods.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican English and British English (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography.\\r\\nThe first large American dictionary, An American Dictionary of the English Language, known as Webster's Dictionary, was written by Noah Webster in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some auxiliary verbs; formal (rather than notional) agreement with collective nouns; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: learned/learnt, burned/burnt, snuck/sneaked, dove/dived) although the purportedly \\"British\\" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE in school, BrE at school); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE to the hospital, BrE to hospital; contrast, however, AmE actress Elizabeth Taylor, BrE the actress Elizabeth Taylor). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,[82] and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences in orthography are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as flavor for British flavour, fiber for fibre, defense for defence, analyze for analyse, license for licence, catalog for catalogue and traveling for travelling. Noah Webster popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, \\"he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology\\".[83] Other differences are due to the francophile tastes of the 19th century Victorian era Britain (for example they preferred programme for program, manoeuvre for maneuver, cheque for check, etc.).[84] AmE almost always uses -ize in words like realize. BrE prefers -ise, but also uses -ize on occasion (see Oxford spelling).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called \\"comma splices\\" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark over single.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmE sometimes favors words that are morphologically more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE transportation and BrE transport or where the British form is a back-formation, such as AmE burglarize and BrE burgle (from burglar). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish English also differs from American English in that \\"schedule\\" can be pronounced with either [sk] or [?].[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nClick on a coloured area to see an article about English in that country or region","input":"How did the english language spread to america?"},{"output":"December 7, 1979","context":"","input":"When was the first star trek movie released?"},{"output":"public research university","context":"San Diego State University (SDSU, San Diego State) is a public research university in San Diego, California, and is the largest and oldest higher education institution in San Diego County. Founded in 1897 as San Diego Normal School, it is the third-oldest university in the 23-member California State University (CSU). SDSU has a Fall 2016 student body of 34,688 and an alumni base of more than 280,000.[9]\\r\\nThe Carnegie Foundation has designated San Diego State University a \\"Doctoral University\\" with \\"Higher Research Activity\\".[10] In the 2015ÿ16 fiscal year, the university obtained $130 million in public and private fundinga total of 707 awardsup from $120.6 million the previous fiscal year.[11]\\r\\nAs reported by the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index released by the Academic Analytics organization of Stony Brook, New York, SDSU is the number one small research university in the United States for four academic years in a row.[12][13][14] SDSU sponsors the second highest number of Fulbright Scholars in the State of California, just behind UC Berkeley. Since 2005, the university has produced over 65 Fulbright student scholars.[15]\\r\\nThe university generates over $2.4 billion annually for the San Diego economy, while 60 percent of SDSU graduates remain in San Diego,[16] making SDSU a primary educator of the region's work force.[17] Committed to serving the diverse San Diego region, SDSU ranks among the top ten universities nationwide in terms of ethnic and racial diversity among its student body, as well as the number of bachelor's degrees conferred upon minority students.[16]\\r\\nSan Diego State University is a member of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC),[18] the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, and the Southwest Border Security Consortium.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEstablished on March 13, 1897, San Diego State University first began as the San Diego Normal School, meant to educate local women as elementary school teachers. It was located on a 17-acre (6.9?ha) campus on Park Boulevard in University Heights (now the headquarters of the San Diego Unified School District). It opened with seven faculty members and 91 students; the curriculum was initially limited to English, history and mathematics.[19] In 1923, the San Diego Normal School became San Diego State Teachers College, \\"a four-year public institution controlled by the state Board of Education\\".\\r\\nBy the 1930s the school had outgrown its original campus. In 1931 it moved to its current location on a mesa at what was then the eastern edge of San Diego. In 1935, the school expanded its offerings beyond teacher education and became San Diego State College.[20] In 1960, San Diego State College became a part of the California State Colleges system, now known as The California State University.[21] Finally in 1972, San Diego State College became California State University, San Diego, and in 1974 San Diego State University (SDSU).[22]\\r\\nJohn F. Kennedy, then the President of the United States of America, gave the graduation commencement address at San Diego State University on June 6, 1963.[23][24] Kennedy was given an honorary doctorate degree in law at the ceremony, making SDSU the first California State College to award an honorary doctorate. In 1964, this event was registered as California Historical Landmark #798.[8]\\r\\nOn May 29, 1964, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. addressed a near-capacity audience in the Open Air Theater. King discussed his vision for the future and called for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, then being debated in the Senate.[26]\\r\\nIn April 2012, the XIV Dalai Lama spoke at SDSU's Viejas Arena as part of his \\"Compassion Without Borders\\" tour.[29]\\r\\nSDSU has had 10 presidents, two of whom served in an acting capacity. Several structures on the campus are named in past presidents' honor, such as Hardy Tower, Hepner Hall (integrated in the university's logo), and the Malcolm A. Love Library.[30] In March 2017 President Hirshman announced his resignation for June 30, 2017; he will assume the position of president at Stevenson University in Maryland.[31] Sally Roush will be the interim president, until a permanent president is announced in the summer of 2018 by the Board of Trustees. [32]\\r\\nThe university awards 190[33] bachelor's degrees, 91 master's degrees, 25 doctoral degrees including EdD, DPT, JD, AuD, DNP, and PhD programs in collaboration with other universities. SDSU also offers 26 different teaching credentials.[34] The university offers more doctoral degrees than any other campus in the entire California State University, while also enrolling the largest student body of doctoral students in the system.[35] In 2015, SDSU enrolled the most doctoral students in its entire history.[36]\\r\\nSeveral buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:[37]\\r\\nOther buildings on campus include:\\r\\nStorm Hall was named in honor of geography department professor Alvena Storm, who served as department chair, and on the faculty for over 40 years since 1926. Nasatir Hall was named for Abraham P. Nasatir, a professor emeritus of history who taught at SDSU for 46 years (1928ÿ74) and was later internationally recognized for his research on California history, receiving four Fulbright Fellowships.[58]\\r\\nIn 1937, Quetzal Hall, the first dormitory, opened for 40 women students and was located off campus.[44] In 1952, 50 college males conducted a panty raid at Quetzal Hall, causing $1,000 in damages. Police arrested 13 of the students and the young women later retaliated by attacking the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house.[59] In 1968, the coed dorm Zura Hall was built, and more rooms were added later.[60] Chapultepec Hall held 580 students when first built.[61]\\r\\nToday, the university owns and operates housing for over 4,100 students in residence halls and student apartments, fraternity row, and language and honors housing. Approximately 63 percent of first-time freshman live in on-campus housing, while about 14 percent of the overall student body resides in on campus housing.[62] SDSU offers themed living communities in the freshman and upperclassman housing, such as \\"pathways for transfers\\", \\"gender-neutral housing\\", and \\"explore San Diego\\".\\r\\nSince 1968, SDSU's Astronomy Department has owned the Mount Laguna Observatory located in the Cleveland National Forest.[63]\\r\\nThe Coastal and Marine Institute Laboratory (CMIL), formerly known as the Coastal Waters Laboratory, is an academic laboratory operated by the SDSU College of Sciences. It is located on a coastal site on the grounds of the old San Diego Naval Training Center (now part of Liberty Station).\\r\\nSDSU operates a branch campus, the Imperial Valley Campus (IVC) located in Calexico, California, with an additional campus in Brawley, California. IVC includes a research park and related facilities. The campus originally served only upper division, teacher certification, and graduate students but now serves a selective cohort of freshmen and sophomores pursuing degrees in criminal justice, liberal studies, or psychology.[65]\\r\\nSDSU-Georgia is a branch campus located in Tbilisi, Georgia, in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia.[66] SDSU-Georgia is run in conjunction with three Georgian universities: Georgian Technical University (GTU), Ilia State University (ISU), and Tbilisi State University (TSU).[67] The SDSU-Georgia branch campus is offering courses leading to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) bachelors degrees.[67]\\r\\nSDSU formerly operated a campus in North County (San Diego area), which was later converted into the larger California State University San Marcos. In the South Bay, SDSU operated a campus in National City, California. This campus shared facilities with Southwestern College. The South Bay Campus is now closed indefinitely.\\r\\nFall Freshman Statistics[70]\\r\\nSan Diego State University is consistently one of the most applied-to universities in the United States, receiving over 84,400 undergraduate applications (including transfer and first time freshman) for the Fall 2016 semester and accepting nearly 26,700 for an admission rate of 31.6 percent across the university,[71] the third-lowest admission rate in the 23-campus California State University system.[72]\\r\\nFor Fall 2016, SDSU received 23,051 applications for transfer admission and accepted 5,274 (an admission rate of 22.9 percent).[71]\\r\\nFall 2016 incoming freshman had an average high school GPA of 3.68, average ACT score of 25.0, and average SAT score of 1117 (out of 1600; the writing section is not considered).[71]\\r\\nThe university reached its peak enrollment in 1987 with a student body of 35,945 FTES (Full-Time Equivalent Students), which made it at the time the largest university in California and the 10th largest university in the United States.[73] Due to the overwhelming number of students and lack of facilities and majors, The California State University Board of Trustees voted to cap enrollment for SDSU at 33,000. However, in 1993 enrollment dropped to 26,800 (the lowest since 1973) due to a financial crisis.[73] Nonetheless, enrollment has fluctuated through the years and rose back to nearly 35,000 (exceeding the cap) in 2008. For the fall 2016 semester, the university had a total enrollment of 33,778 students ÿ approximately 29,046 undergraduate and 4,732 postgraduate[74] ÿ making it one of the largest research universities in the state of California.\\r\\nIn fall 2013, SDSU had the most doctoral students enrolled in its history at 534 students,[35] also the highest amount of doctorate-seeking students enrolled across the 23-campus CSU system.[35]\\r\\nFrom 2006 to 2010, SDSU was ranked the No. 1 most productive research university among schools with 14 or fewer PhD programs based on the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index. The school has since exceeded the \\"small research\\" limit with 17 PhD programs, in addition to six professional doctorates. SDSU has been designated a \\"Research University\\" with high research activity by the Carnegie Foundation. Since 2000, SDSU faculty and staff have attracted more than $1.5 billion in grants and contracts for research and program administration.[91] As a result, U.S. News & World Report classifies San Diego State University as a \\"National University\\", whereas all other 22 campuses in The California State University system are classified as \\"Regional Universities\\".[89]\\r\\nSDSU is the highest enrolled university in the San Diego metropolitan area. One in seven adults in San Diego who holds a college degree attended SDSU. In 2013, SDSU was lauded for its comprehensive endowment campaign efforts, which raised over $400 million from 2007 to 2013. The Council for Advancement and Support of Education recognized SDSU for its overall performance in fundraising efforts.[92]\\r\\nSan Diego State was ranked the 28th top college in the United States by Payscale and CollegeNet's Social Mobility Index college rankings.[93]\\r\\nMoney Magazine ranked San Diego State 116th in the country out of over 1500 schools it evaluated for its 2015 Best Colleges ranking.[94]\\r\\nThe Daily Beast ranked San Diego State 75th in the country out of the nearly 2,000 schools it evaluated for its 2013 Best Colleges ranking.[95]\\r\\nIn Graduate School Rankings, QS Global 200 Business Schools Report ranks SDSU's business college the 80th best in all of North America.[96]\\r\\nSDSU is also a top producer of U.S. Fulbright Scholars, the U.S. governments flagship international educational exchange program. SDSU has had more than 40 students receive Fulbright Scholarships since 2005.[97] The university ranks No. 30 as the nation's best universities for veterans, according to Military Times Edge.[98] SDSU ranks among the top universities for economic and campus ethnic diversity according to U.S. News & World Report's \\"America's Best Colleges 2012\\".[97] Nearly 45 percent of all SDSU graduates are the first in their family to receive a college degree.[99]\\r\\nInternationally, SDSU offers 335 international education programs in 52 countries. Thirty-four SDSU programs now require international experience for graduation. SDSU ranks first in California among universities of its type in California and third among all universities in California for students studying abroad as part of their college experience. SDSU also ranks 22nd among universities nationwide for the number of students studying abroad (Institute of International Education). Since 2000, nearly 12,000 students have studied abroad: a 900 percent increase in that time. SDSUs undergraduate international business program ranks eleventh in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Reports \\"Americas Best Colleges 2012\\". SDSU is ranked fifth in Sports Management; 23rd in the MBA/MA in Latin American Studies; and 46th in the MBA/Juris Doctor program by Eduniversal for each programs international outreach and reputation in 2011. SDSU and Universidad Aut܇noma de Baja California in Mexico offered the first transnational dual degree between the United States and Mexico, in 1994, through the MEXUS/International Business program. SDSU's international business program also runs transnational dual degree programs with Brazil, Canada, Chile, and Mexico. SDSUs Language Acquisition Resource Center is one of nine sites selected by the U.S. Department of Education to serve as a National Language Resource Center.[97]\\r\\nSDSU ranks second among universities of its type nationwide and first in California for students studying abroad as part of their college experience.[100]\\r\\nSDSU is home to the first-ever MBA program in Global Entrepreneurship.[101] As part of the program, students study at four universities worldwide, including the United States, China, the Middle East, and India.[102] Corporate partners include Qualcomm, Invitrogen, Intel, Microsoft, and KPMG.[102] In 1970, SDSU founded the first women's studies program in the country.\\r\\nModern Healthcare ranked SDSU second for graduate schools for physician executives in relation to their Master in Public Health program.[103] SDSU is ranked No. 9 in Fortune Small Business's \\"America's Best Colleges For Entrepreneurs\\".[104] SDSU ranks 15th best in the nation for the top colleges for engineering majors, and sixth best in California.[105]\\r\\nU.S. News & World Report rankings:[89] USNWR in its 2016 rankings placed SDSU 78th among Top Public Schools and 136th for High School Counselor Rankings among all universities in the nation.

The recognition is shared by fewer than two dozen facilities around the world.[106]\\r\\nSDSU has two named schools established in the university by permanent endowments:\\r\\nAdditionally, SDSU has 11 focused schools:\\r\\nThe financial endowment of SDSU is valued at $220 million as of June 30, 2016.[1] The primary philanthropic arm of San Diego State University is The Campanile Foundation, controlled by the University Advancement division of the university. The San Diego State University Research Foundation, an auxiliary corporation owned and controlled by the university, is the manager and administrator of all philanthropic funds and external funding for the university and its affiliated and auxiliary foundations and corporations.\\r\\nAs of June 30, 2013, permanent assets of the SDSU Campanile Foundation totaled $229 million.[110]\\r\\nFor the 2004ÿ2005 academic year, SDSU received over $157 million USD in external funding from grants and contracts, as well as an additional $57 million USD in donations and charitable giving.[111] For 2005ÿ2006, SDSU received $152 million USD in grants and contracts to support research. This is followed by $47.7 million USD in donations, gifts and other charitable giving.[112]\\r\\nAn auxiliary to The Campanile Foundation is the Aztec Athletic Association, which primarily raises funds for the student athletes in the San Diego State University athletics programs (see discussion of Athletics below and at SDSU Aztecs).\\r\\nOn April 27, 1974, The Phi Beta Kappa Society established an SDSU chapter. It was the first in the CSU system as well as the San Diego area.[73] Other multidisciplinary national honor societies include Phi Kappa Phi, Mortar Board, and Phi Eta Sigma.\\r\\nThe first fraternity on campus was the Delta chapter of Epsilon Eta, which formed on October 25, 1921. By the end of the decade there were six other fraternities and eight sororities. The fraternities and sororities were all local and did not attain national status until after World War II.[115] In 1925, in order to encourage higher grades, the Inter-Fraternity Council and Inter-Sorority Council published the average grades of the fraternity and sorority members. On a 3.0 scale, the average GPA (grade point average) for all students was 1.49, for fraternities was 1.35, and sororities was 1.47.[115] By the mid-1930s there were eight fraternities and eleven sororities,[44] and later expanded to fifteen fraternities and twelve sororities in the 1940s.[116] The first fraternity to go national was Theta Chi and the first sorority was Alpha Xi Delta.[116]\\r\\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, the Greek population had dwindled to 699, but gradually began to increase in the 1980s, reaching 2,900 in 1988. There were 20 fraternities and 13 sororities officially affiliated with the Inter Fraternity Council and Panhellenic Council as well as six independent fraternities/sororities. This made it one of the largest fraternity and sorority systems in the western U.S.[117] On April 6, 1978, Gamma Phi Beta sorority hired a plane to drop marshmallows on fraternity houses during Derby Week, but the plane crashed near Peterson Gym, injuring four students aboard.[118] After, a 1983 USA Today article reported that SDSU Greeks' GPAs were below the campus average, SDSU tightened restrictions and supervision, and by 1989 their grades had increased to slightly above the university average.[118] Between 1989 and 1991, several riots among the fraternities occurred, including one numbering 3,500 people and another requiring 34 police officers to end it.[119] The 2008 drug bust resulted in the suspension of several fraternities as well as the arrests of multiple fraternity members.[120] Currently there are over 50 social fraternities and sororities, including general, professional, and culturally based organizations represented by five governing councils.\\r\\nSan Diego State University was recognized in 2016 among the best universities in the nation for supporting LGBT students. The Campus Pride Index recently ranked SDSU on its 2016 Best of the Best Top 30 list of LGBTQ-friendly colleges and universities. SDSU has been included in this ranking for the past seven years along with institutions like Princeton University and Cornell University.[121]\\r\\nSDSU was recognized in 2014 as one of 20 of the most Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender-friendly campuses in all of the U.S.[122][123] The university attains this recognition through its welcome week LGBT reception, Safe Zone ally training, Big Gay BBQs, participating in Aids Walk San Diego and Pride San Diego, hosting an LGBT college fair, and holding a Lavender Graduation ceremony and several lecture series. The university is one of the few campuses in California that is home to the gay social fraternity, Delta Lambda Phi. Additionally, SDSU was the first university in California to offer a major in LGBT studies, while also offering a minor and graduate degree in the discipline.[124] In 2014, SDSU opened a first-ever Pride Center at the former Student Organization Annex, with the mission to provide resources and help meet the needs and challenges of LGBT students.[125]\\r\\nStudents began publishing The White and Gold in 1902, which was a literary magazine and newspaper.[126] In 1913, a new newspaper was established entitled Normal News Weekly.[127] The school newspaper Paper Lantern (Normal News Weekly was renamed after the addition of the junior college) became The Aztec in September 1925.[128] It was later expanded to its current name, The Daily Aztec in fall 1959. The school's annual yearbook was named Del Sudoeste (Spanish for \\"of the southwest\\") in the early 1920s. The Koala, a comedy newspaper that is widely known around the San Diego State area, is also distributed monthly on campus but is not directly connected to the school at the moment.[128]\\r\\nThe first major sport on campus was rowing, but it initially had no coaches or tournaments.[129] Other sports that developed early in the campus's history were tennis, basketball, golf, croquet, and baseball.[129] The school's football program had such a limited selection of players that faculty had to be used to fill the roster.[129] When the college merged with the junior college in 1921, the college became a member of the Junior College Conference. After the school won most of the conference titles in a variety of sports, the league requested that college leave out of fairness to the smaller schools. For its football program, the team outscored its opponents 249 to 52 in ten games, resulting in the first sales of season tickets in 1923.[130] From 1925 to 1926, the college played as an independent. It then joined the Southern California Conference in 1926, where it did not win a football conference championship until 1936. However, in other sports including tennis and basketball, it excelled.[130] The college remained with the conference until 1939, when it joined the California Collegiate Athletic Association.[131]\\r\\nThe basketball team reached and won multiple championships games during the 1930ÿ1940s, including a conference title in 1931, 1934, 1937, and 1939. It reached the national championship in 1939 and 1940, losing in the final rounds. However, in 1941 the college returned and won the college's first national title.[131] In track, the team won conference titles in 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939.[131] The football team won conference titles in 1936 and 1937, and the baseball team won three conference titles and placed second three times between 1935 and 1941.[131]\\r\\nIn 1955, the Aztec Club was established and raised $20,000 a year by 1957. The club worked in increasing athletic scholarships, hiring better coaches, and developing the colleges intercollegiate athletic programs. In 1956, students approved through a vote of allowing a mandatory student activity fee, with a portion going to athletics. By the end of the decade the budget had doubled to $40,000. The campuss most successful sports program during the 1950s was cross-country, when the team won eight straight conference titles and AAU regional titles and placed high in national competitions. Basketball teams ranged from last in the conference to multiple conference, regional, and national appearances. The football program had its first undefeated team in 1951, but in the last part of the decade earned the worst records in the schools football program under the direction of head coach Paul Governali.[132]\\r\\nUnder Governali, the campuss football program suffered due to Governalis policy of not recruiting players. To improve the program, Love hired in 1961 Don Coryell, who led the program win three consecutive championships (1966ÿ68), and 104 wins, 19 losses, and 2 ties by the time he left SDSU. Coryell was assisted by John Madden, Joe Gibbs, and Rod Dowhower, among others. In Coryells first year, attendance at home games averaged 8,000 people, but by 1966 it had doubled to 16,000. This later jumped to 26,000ÿ41,000 per game with the addition of the new San Diego Stadium. At some games, attendance was larger than at San Diego Chargers games. There were several undefeated seasons and many players broke records for most catches, touchdowns, and passing yards. In 1969, San Diego State College moved into NCAA Division I, leaving the California Collegiate Athletic Association. In 1972, Coyrell left to pursue coaching in the NFL.[133]\\r\\nBasketball also did well, with the 1967ÿ68 team being ranked the number one college-level team in the nation, although it did not win a national title. The Aztecs also won the 1960 CCAA baseball title and multiple national championships throughout the 1960s in track, cross country, and swimming.[133]\\r\\nBy 1970ÿ71, the campus had 14 NCAA sports. The 1973 mens volleyball team won the NCAA national championship which was the first NCAA national title since moving to Division I status.[134]\\r\\nSDSU competes in NCAA Division I FBS. Its primary conference is the Mountain West Conference; its women's rowing team competes in the American Athletic Conference, its women's water polo team participates in the Golden Coast Conference, and its men's soccer team is a single-sport member of the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12). The ice hockey team competes in the ACHA with other western region club teams (www.sdsuhockey.com). The crew team's championship regatta is in the WIRA (Western International Rowing Association). The university colors are scarlet (red) and black, SDSU's athletic teams are called the \\"Aztecs\\", and its mascot is the Aztec Warrior, formerly referred to as \\"Monty Montezuma\\". In 2008, a San Diego Union-Tribune article noted that athletics revenues have been steadily decreasing from 2006-2008.[135]\\r\\nThe football team plays at Qualcomm Stadium (formerly known as Jack Murphy Stadium).\\r\\nThe basketball teams play at Viejas Arena on the SDSU campus.\\r\\nThe baseball team plays in Tony Gwynn Stadium on the SDSU campus, named after the SDSU baseball and basketball player and late head coach, Tony Gwynn.\\r\\nThe women's volleyball team plays in Peterson Gym on the SDSU campus. The men's volleyball team won the NCAA Championship in 1973, but the team has since been disbanded.\\r\\nBoth the men's and women's teams both play at the Sports Deck on the SDSU campus. The women compete in the Mountain West Conference while the men compete in the Pac-12 Conference.\\r\\nSDSU's ice hockey team participates in the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) Men's Division 2. They advanced to National Championship final game in 2008 for ACHA Men's Division 3, but lost 7ÿ3 to California University of Pennsylvania.\\r\\nAztec Racing is SDSU's Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) student chapter. Every year, SDSU engineering students design and construct an open wheel, open cockpit race car to Formula SAE (formerly Formula Society of Automotive Engineers) specifications. Aztec Racing then competes against other universities' Formula SAE teams in an annual competition event, where the cars are raced against each other and judged on design. Attendance at Formula SAE competition is international, with several hundreds of schools competing each year. Students from other majors participate as well, frequently in the areas of management, promotion and other aspects of the project.\\r\\nInitial clubs that were first started on campus including the Debating Club, the Associated Student Body, YWCA, and in 1906, An Alumni Association.[126] The oldest club on campus was The Rowing Association.[115]\\r\\nOn February 27, 1931, President Hardy permitted 500 students to paint rocks to form a 400-foot (120?m) white S on Cowles Mountain. The idea of \\"S Mountain\\" was created by the Council of Twelve and initially supported by Hardy. The giant S was lit at night for the opening football game of a season (performed by the freshman to build school spirit) along with pep rallies, and was repainted throughout its history.[38][136] At the time, it was the largest collegiate symbol in the world.[137] During World War II, the S was camouflaged to prevent it becoming a reference point for enemy bombing aircraft.[138] It was returned to its normal state in April 1944.[139] In the 1970s students stopped painting it and brush obstructed the symbol. After a 1988 brush fire it was exposed, and students repainted it. In fall 1997, a group of 100 volunteers climbed Cowles Mountain after dusk to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the school by using flashlights to once again outline the S on the side of the mountain. In 1990, a high school prank defaced the S to read as \\"91\\" in honor of their graduating class.[140]\\r\\nThe initial colors of the school were white and gold. When the junior college was added to the campus in 1921, its colors of blue and gold were merged, resulting in a blue, gold, and white color scheme. New colors were later chosen as gold and purple, until being replaced by scarlet and black on January 28, 1928.[141]\\r\\nThe school's prior nicknames for its mascot included \\"Normalites\\", \\"Professors\\", and \\"Wampus Cats\\". However, after a 1924 committee met to address the issue, the name \\"Aztecs\\" was decided on.[128] In 2003, the Aztec Warrior was approved by a student and alumni vote to become the official university mascot after the school's prior mascot, Monty Montezuma, was discontinued.[142]\\r\\nSDSU was ranked as one of the most dangerous college campuses in the U.S. in 2012 by Business Insider. It placed San Diego State as the sixth most dangerous campus (of those having over 10,000 students and according to data from 2008 to 2011), due to 27 violent crimes and 575 property crimes per year.[143]\\r\\nThe San Diego State University shooting occurred on August 15, 1996. A 36-year-old graduate engineering student, while apparently defending his thesis, shot and killed his three professors, Constantinos Lyrintzis, Cheng Liang, and D. Preston Lowrey III, at San Diego State University. The shooter, who was suffering from certain mental problems, was convicted on July 19, 1997, and was sentenced to life in prison. As a memorial, tables with a plaque with information about each victim have been placed adjacent to the College of Engineering building.\\r\\nOn May 6, 2008, the Drug Enforcement Administration announced the arrest of 96 individuals, of whom 33 were San Diego State University students, on a variety of drug charges in a narcotics sting operation dubbed Operation Sudden Fall.[144] It was originally reported that 75 of the arrested were students, but the inflated number included students who had been arrested months earlier, in some cases for simple possession.[145] The bust, which was the largest in the history of San Diego County, drew a mixed reaction from the community.[146]\\r\\nIn 2015, SDSU began operation \\"It's on Us\\" to combat the sexual assault crisis the university was experiencing.[147] In the fall 2014 semester alone, there were 14 sexual assaults reported on or around the SDSU college area. Furthermore, SDSU was noted in early 2015 for falsely accusing a foreign-exchange student of sexual assault and allegedly not affording the student due-process. The student has since sued the university.[148]\\r\\nSan Diego State University has over 260,000 alumni worldwide. The university is one of the top producers of U.S. Student Fulbright Scholars in the nation.[149]\\r\\nVic Fuentes, Musician (lead singer, songwriter and guitarist of Pierce the Veil)","input":"What type of college is san diego state university?"},{"output":"to mate with a fertile queen","context":"A drone is a male bee. Unlike the female worker bee, drones do not have stingers and do not gather nectar and pollen. A drone's primary role is to mate with a fertile queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDrones carry only one type of allele at each chromosomal position, because they are haploid (containing only one set of chromosomes from the mother). During the development of eggs within a queen, a diploid cell with 32 chromosomes divides to generate haploid cells called gametes with 16 chromosomes. The result is a haploid egg, with chromosomes having a new combination of alleles at the various loci. This process is called arrhenotokous parthenogenesis or simply arrhenotoky.\\r\\nBecause the male bee technically has only a mother, and no father, its genealogical tree is unusual. The first generation has one member (the male). One generation back also has one member (the mother). Two generations back are two members (the mother and father of the mother). Three generations back are three members. Four back are five members. That is, the numbers in each generation going back are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... ÿ the Fibonacci sequence.[1]\\r\\nMuch debate and controversy exist in the scientific literature about the dynamics and apparent benefit of the combined forms of reproduction in honey bees and other social insects, known as the haplodiploid sex-determination system. The drones have two reproductive functions: Each drone grows from the queen's unfertilized haploid egg and produces some 10 million male sperm cells, each genetically identical to the egg. Drones also serve as a vehicle to mate with a new queen to fertilize her eggs. Female worker bees develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid in origin, which means that the sperm from a father provides a second set of 16 chromosomes for a total of 32: one set from each parent. Since all the sperm cells produced by a particular drone are genetically identical, full sisters are more closely related than full sisters of other animals where the sperm is not genetically identical.\\r\\nA laying worker bee exclusively produces totally unfertilized eggs, which develop into drones. As an exception to this rule, laying worker bees in some subspecies of honey bees may also produce diploid (and therefore female) fertile offspring in a process called thelytoky, in which the second set of chromosomes comes not from sperm, but from one of the three polar bodies during anaphase II of meiosis.\\r\\nIn honey bees, the genetics of offspring can best be controlled by artificially inseminating a queen with drones collected from a single hive, where the drones' mother is known. In the natural mating process, a queen mates with multiple drones,[citation needed] which may not come from the same hive. Therefore, batches of female offspring have fathers of a completely different genetic origin.\\r\\nA drone is characterized by eyes that are twice the size of those of worker bees and queens, and a body size greater than that of worker bees, though usually smaller than the queen bee. His abdomen is stouter than the abdomen of workers or queen. Although heavy bodied, the drone must be able to fly fast enough to accompany the queen in flight.\\r\\nAn Apis cerana colony has about 200 drones during high summer peak time.\\r\\nDrones die off or are ejected from the hive by the worker bees in late autumn, and do not reappear in the bee hive until late spring.\\r\\nThe drones' main function is to be ready to fertilize a receptive queen. Drones in a hive do not usually mate with a virgin queen of the same hive because they drift from hive to hive. Mating generally takes place in or near drone congregation areas. How these areas are selected is poorly understood, but they do exist. When a drone mates with a queen of the same hive, the resultant queen will have a spotty brood pattern (numerous empty cells on a brood frame) due to the removal of diploid drone larvae by nurse bees (i.e., a fertilized egg with two identical sex genes will develop into a drone instead of a worker).\\r\\nMating occurs in flight, which accounts for drones's need for better vision, which is provided by their large eyes. Should a drone succeed in mating, he soon dies because the penis and associated abdominal tissues are ripped from the drone's body after sexual intercourse.[2]\\r\\nHoney bee queen breeders may breed drones to be used for artificial insemination or open mating. A queen mating yard must have many drones to be successful.\\r\\nIn areas with severe winters, all drones are driven out of the hive in the autumn. A colony begins to rear drones in spring and drone population reaches its peak coinciding with the swarm season in late spring and early summer. The life expectancy of a drone is about 90 days.\\r\\nAlthough the drone is highly specialized to perform one function, mating and continuing the propagation of the hive, it is not completely without side benefit to it. All bees, when they sense the hive's temperature deviating from proper limits, either generate heat by shivering, or exhaust heat by moving air with their wingsbehaviours which drones share with worker bees.\\r\\nDrones do not exhibit typical worker bee behaviours such as nectar and pollen gathering, nursing, or hive construction. While drones are unable to sting, if picked up, they may swing their tails in an attempt to frighten the disturber.[citation needed] In some species, drones buzz around intruders in an attempt to disorient them if the nest is disturbed.\\r\\nDrones fly in abundance in the early afternoon and are known to congregate in drone congregation areas a good distance away from the hive.\\r\\nThe drone penis is designed to disperse a large quantity of seminal fluid and spermatozoa with great speed and force. The penis is held internally in the drone (an endophallus). During mating, the organ is everted (turned inside out), into the queen. The eversion of the penis is achieved by contracting abdominal muscles, which increases hemolymph pressure, effectively \\"inflating\\" the penis. Cornua claspers at the base of the penis help to grip the queen.\\r\\nMating between a single drone and the queen lasts less than 5 seconds, and it is often completed within 1ÿ2 seconds. Mating occurs mid-flight, and 10ÿ40?m above ground. Since the queen mates with 12I7 drones, and drones die after mating, each drone must make the most of his single shot. The drone makes first contact from above the queen, his thorax above her abdomen, straddling her. He then grasps her with all six legs, and everts the endophallus into her opened sting chamber. If the queens sting chamber is not fully opened, mating is unsuccessful, so some males that mount the queen do not transfer semen. Once the endophallus has been everted, the drone is paralyzed, flipping backwards as he ejaculates. The process of ejaculation is explosivesemen is blasted through the queens sting chamber and into the oviduct. The process is sometimes audible to the human ear, akin to a \\"popping\\" sound. The ejaculation is so powerful that it ruptures the endophallus, disconnecting the drone from the queen. The bulb of the endophallus is broken off inside of the queen during matingso drones mate only once, and die shortly after. The leftover penis remaining in the queens vagina is referred to as the mating sign. The plug will not prevent the next drone from mating with the same queen, but may prevent semen from flowing out of the vagina.[3]\\r\\nMating between the drones and a virgin queen takes place away from the colony, in mid-air mating sites. These mating sites, called congregation areas, are specific locations, where drones wait for the arrival of virgin queens. A congregation area is typically 10ÿ40 m above ground, and can have a diameter of 30ÿ200 m. The boundaries of a congregation area are distinct; queens flying a few meters outside the boundaries are mostly ignored by the drones. Congregation areas are typically used year after year, with some spots showing little change over 12 years. Since drones are expelled from a colony during the winter, and new drones are raised each spring, inexperienced drones must find these congregation areas anew. This suggests some environmental cues define a congregation area, although the actual cues are unknown.\\r\\nCongregation areas are typically located above open ground, away from trees or hills, where flight is somewhat protected from the wind (calm winds may be helpful during mating flight). At the same time, many congregation areas do not show such characteristics, such as those located above water or the forest canopy. Some studies have suggested that magnetic orientation could play a role, since drones older than 6 days contain cells in the abdomen that are rich in magnetite.\\r\\nCongregation areas can be located by attaching a virgin queen (in a cage) to a balloon floating above ground. The person then moves around, taking note of where drones are attracted to the caged queen. Congregation areas are not found closer than 90?m from an apiary, and congregation areas located farther away from apiaries receive more drones. In a congregation area, drones accumulate from as many as 200 colonies, with estimates of up to 25,000 individual drones. This broad mixing of drones is how a virgin queen can ensure she will receive the genetic diversity needed for her colony. By flying to congregation areas further away from her colony, she further increases the probability of outbreeding.\\r\\nA single drone visits multiple congregation areas during his lifetime, often taking multiple trips per afternoon. A drones mating flight averages 25ÿ32 minutes, but can last up to 60 minutes, before he must return to the colony to refuel with honey. While at the site, the drones fly around passively, waiting for the arrival of a virgin. When the virgin queen arrives to the congregation area, the drones locate her by visual and olfactory cues. At this point, it is a race to mate with the virgin queen, to be genetically represented in the newly founded colony. The swarming drones, as they actively follow the queen, reportedly resemble a drone comet, dissolving and reforming as the drones chase the virgin queen. Drones greatly outnumber the quantity of virgin queens produced per season, so even with multiple mating by the queen, very few drones mate successfully (estimated at less than one in 1000). If needed, a virgin queen can embark on multiple nuptial flights, to be sure to receive enough semen from enough drones.\\r\\nVarroa destructor, a parasitic mite, propagates within the brood cell of bees. The Varroa mite prefers drone brood as it guarantees a longer development period, which is important for its own propagation success. The number of Varroa mites can be kept in check by removing the capped drone brood and either freezing the brood comb or heating it.","input":"What do drone bees do in the hive?"},{"output":"an average of 64","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a list of American police officers killed in the line of duty.

Small numbers also live in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Zulu were originally a major clan in what is today Northern KwaZulu-Natal, founded ca. 1709 by Zulu kaMalandela. In the Nguni languages, iZulu means heaven, or weather.[3] At that time, the area was occupied by many large Nguni communities and clans (also called isizwe=nation, people or isibongo=clan or family name). Nguni communities had migrated down Africa's east coast over centuries, as part of the Bantu migrations probably arriving in what is now South Africa in about the 9th century.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Zulu formed a powerful state in 1818[4] under the leader Shaka. Shaka, as the Zulu King, gained a large amount of power over the tribe. As commander in the army of the powerful Mthethwa Empire, he became leader of his mentor Dingiswayo's paramouncy and united what was once a confederation of tribes into an imposing empire under Zulu hegemony.\\r\\nOn 11 December 1878, agents of the British delivered an ultimatum to 11 chiefs representing Cetshwayo. The terms forced upon Cetshwayo required him to disband his army and accept British authority. Cetshwayo refused, and war followed January 12, 1879. During the war, the Zulus defeated the British at the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January. The British managed to get the upper hand after the Battle at Rorke's Drift, and subsequently win the war with the Zulu being defeated at the Battle of Ulundi on 4 July.\\r\\nAfter Cetshwayo's capture a month following his defeat, the British divided the Zulu Empire into 13 \\"kinglets\\". The sub-kingdoms fought amongst each other until 1883 when Cetshwayo was reinstated as king over Zululand. This still did not stop the fighting and the Zulu monarch was forced to flee his realm by Zibhebhu, one of the 13 kinglets, supported by Boer mercenaries. Cetshwayo died in February 1884, killed by Zibhebhu's regime, leaving his son, the 15-year-old Dinuzulu, to inherit the throne. In-fighting between the Zulu continued for years, until Zululand was absorbed fully into the British colony of Natal.\\r\\nUnder apartheid, the homeland of KwaZulu (Kwa meaning place of) was created for Zulu people. In 1970, the Bantu Homeland Citizenship Act provided that all Zulus would become citizens of KwaZulu, losing their South African citizenship. KwaZulu consisted of a large number of disconnected pieces of land, in what is now KwaZulu-Natal. Hundreds of thousands of Zulu people living on privately owned \\"black spots\\" outside of KwaZulu were dispossessed and forcibly moved to bantustans ÿ worse land previously reserved for whites contiguous to existing areas of KwaZulu ÿ in the name of \\"consolidation.\\" By 1993, approximately 5.2 million Zulu people lived in KwaZulu, and approximately 2 million lived in the rest of South Africa. The Chief Minister of KwaZulu, from its creation in 1970 (as Zululand) was Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. In 1994, KwaZulu was joined with the province of Natal, to form modern KwaZulu-Natal.\\r\\nInkatha YeSizwe means \\"the crown of the nation\\". In 1975, Buthelezi revived the Inkatha YaKwaZulu, predecessor of the Inkatha Freedom Party. This organization was nominally a protest movement against apartheid, but held more conservative views than the ANC. For example, Inkatha was opposed to the armed struggle, and to sanctions against South Africa. Inkatha was initially on good terms with the ANC, but the two organizations came into increasing conflict beginning in 1976 in the aftermath of the Soweto Uprising.\\r\\nThe modern Zulu population is fairly evenly distributed in both urban and rural areas. Although KwaZulu-Natal is still their heartland, large numbers have been attracted to the relative economic prosperity of Gauteng province. Indeed, Zulu is the most widely spoken home language in the province, followed by Sotho.\\r\\nThe language of the Zulu people is \\"isiZulu\\", a Bantu language; more specifically, part of the Nguni subgroup. Zulu is the most widely spoken language in South Africa, where it is an official language. More than half of the South African population are able to understand it, with over 9 million first-language and over 15 million second-language speakers.[5] Many Zulu people also speak Afrikaans, English, Portuguese, Xitsonga, Sesotho and others from among South Africa's 11 official languages.\\r\\nZulus wear a variety of attire, both traditional for ceremonial or culturally celebratory occasions, and modern westernized clothing for everyday use. The women dress differently depending on whether they are single, engaged, or married. The men wore a leather belt with two strips of hide hanging down front and back.\\r\\nMost Zulu people state their beliefs to be Christian. Some of the most common churches to which they belong are African Initiated Churches, especially the Zion Christian Church, [Nazareth Baptist Church] and United African Apostolic Church, although membership of major European Churches, such as the Dutch Reformed, Anglican and Catholic Churches are also common. Nevertheless, many lZulus retain their traditional pre-Christian belief system of ancestor worship in parallel with their Christianity.\\r\\nZulu religion includes belief in a creator God (uNkulunkulu) who is above interacting in day-to-day human life, although this belief appears to have originated from efforts by early Christian missionaries to frame the idea of the Christian God in Zulu terms.[6] Traditionally, the more strongly held Zulu belief was in ancestor spirits (amaThongo or amaDlozi), who had the power to intervene in people's lives, for good or ill.[7] This belief continues to be widespread among the modern Zulu population.[8]\\r\\nTraditionally, the Zulu recognize several elements to be present in a human being: the physical body (inyama yomzimba or umzimba); the breath or life force (umoya womphefumulo or umoya); and the \\"shadow,\\" prestige, or personality (isithunzi). Once the umoya leaves the body, the isithunzi may live on as an ancestral spirit (idlozi) only if certain conditions were met in life.[9][10] Behaving with ubuntu, or showing respect and generosity towards others, enhances one's moral standing or prestige in the community, one's isithunzi.[11] By contrast, acting in a negative way towards others can reduce the isithunzi, and it is possible for the isithunzi to fade away completely.[12]\\r\\nIn order to appeal to the spirit world, a diviner (sangoma) must invoke the ancestors through divination processes to determine the problem. Then, a herbalist (inyanga) prepares a mixture (muthi) to be consumed in order to influence the ancestors. As such, diviners and herbalists play an important part in the daily lives of the Zulu people. However, a distinction is made between white muthi (umuthi omhlope), which has positive effects, such as healing or the prevention or reversal of misfortune, and black muthi (umuthi omnyama), which can bring illness or death to others, or ill-gotten wealth to the user.[8] Users of black muthi are considered witches, and shunned by the society.\\r\\nChristianity had difficulty gaining a foothold among the Zulu people, and when it did it was in a syncretic fashion. Isaiah Shembe, considered the Zulu Messiah, presented a form of Christianity (the Nazareth Baptist Church) which incorporated traditional customs.[13]","input":"When did the zulu arrive in south africa?"},{"output":"September 27, 2018","context":"The fifteenth season of the American television medical drama Grey's Anatomy was ordered on April 20, 2018, by American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[1] The season premiered on September 27, 2018 with a special 2-hour premiere.[2] The episode count for the season will be 24 episodes.[3] The season is produced by ABC Studios, in association with Shondaland Production Company and The Mark Gordon Company; the showrunners being Krista Vernoff and William Harper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis season is the first not to feature both Jessica Capshaw as Dr. Arizona Robbins and Sarah Drew as Dr. April Kepner since their introductions in the fifth and sixth seasons respectively, following their departures at the conclusion of the previous season.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season follows the story of surgical residents, fellows, and attendings as they experience the difficulties of the competitive careers they have chosen.

He was also the last surviving Civil War veteran on either side whose status is undisputed. At least three men who followed him in death claimed to be Confederate veterans, but one has been debunked and the other two are unverified. The last surviving Union soldier to see combat was James Hard (1843ÿ1953).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWoolson was born in Antwerp, New York, to Willard P. Woolson (1811ÿ1862) and Caroline Baldwin (ca. 1822ÿunknown).[2] He claimed to be born on February 11, 1847, but his entry in the 1850 United States Census lists him as born in 1850.[3][4] Entries in the later census records and in the 1905 Minnesota State Census support the conclusion that he was born in 1850.[5]\\r\\nHis father, Willard Woolson, enlisted in the Union Army. Willard was wounded at the Battle of Shiloh and was transported to an Army hospital in Windom, Minnesota, where he would die of his wounds. Albert and his mother moved to Windom to accompany Willard. Albert enlisted as a drummer boy in Company C, 1st Minnesota Heavy Artillery Regiment on October 10, 1864, becoming the company's drummer. However, the company never saw action, and Albert Woolson was discharged on September 7, 1865.\\r\\nWoolson returned to Minnesota, where he lived the rest of his life. He was a carpenter and later a member of the Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.), a powerful political organization made up of Civil War veterans where he became senior vice commander in chief in 1953.\\r\\nIn his final days, he lived at 215 East Fifth Street in Duluth, Minnesota. Woolson died at St. Luke's Hospital in Duluth on August 2, 1956, at what was then thought to be the age of 109, of a \\"recurring lung congestion condition\\". He was twice widowed and was survived by six daughters and two sons. Woolson was buried with full military honors by the National Guard at Park Hill Cemetery.[6]\\r\\nFollowing his death, President Dwight D.

The Mission was founded on October 9, 1776, by Lieutenant Jos Joaquin Moraga and Francisco Pal܇u (a companion of Junpero Serra), both members of the de Anza Expedition, which had been charged with bringing Spanish settlers to Alta (upper) California, and evangelizing the local Natives, the Ohlone. Some of the Mission's buildings have been turned into business including a print shop, and several saloons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe settlement was named for St. Francis of Assisi, the founder of the Franciscan Order, but was also commonly known as \\"Mission Dolores\\" owing to the presence of a nearby creek named Arroyo de Nuestra Se?ora de los Dolores, meaning \\"Our Lady of Sorrows Creek.\\"[citation needed] During the expedition of Juan Bautista de Anza, this site was identified by Pedro Font as the most suitable site for a mission in the San Francisco area.[11]\\r\\nThe original Mission was a small structure dedicated on July 4, 1823, after the required church documents arrived. It was located near what is today the intersection of Camp and Albion Streets (according to most sources)[citation needed], about a block-and-a-half east of the surviving Adobe Mission building, and on the shores of a lake (supposedly long since filled) called Laguna de Los Dolores.[4] A historical marker at that location depicts this lake, but whether it ever actually existed is a matter of some dispute. (Creek geologists Janet Sowers and Christopher Richard propose that the legendary lake is the result of misunderstandings of Juan Bautista de Anza's 1776 writings. According to their 2011 hydrological map, there were no lakes in the area, only creeks.)[12]\\r\\nThe present Mission church, near what is now the intersection of Dolores and 16th Streets, was dedicated in 1791. At the time of dedication, a mural painted by native labor adorned the focal wall of the chapel. The Mission was constructed of Adobe and part of a complex of buildings used for housing, agricultural and manufacturing enterprises (see architecture of the California missions). Though most of the Mission complex, including the quadrangle and Convento, has either been altered or demolished outright during the intervening years, the fa?ade of the Mission chapel has remained relatively unchanged since its construction in 1782ÿ1791.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to Mission historian Brother Guire Cleary, the early 19th century saw the greatest period of activity at San Francisco de Ass:\\r\\nAt its peak in 1810ÿ1820, the average Indian population at Pueblo Dolores was about 1,100 persons. The California missions were not only houses of worship. They were farming communities, manufacturers of all sorts of products, hotels, ranches, hospitals, schools, and the centers of the largest communities in the state...in 1810 the Mission owned 11,000 sheep, 11,000 cows, and thousands of horses, goats, pigs, and mules. Its ranching and farming operations extended as far south as San Mateo and east to Alameda. Horses were corralled on Potrero Hill, and the milking sheds for the cows were located along Dolores Creek at what is today Mission High School. Twenty looms were kept in operation to process wool into cloth. The circumference of the mission's holdings was said to have been about 125 miles.[13]\\r\\nThe Mission chapel, along with \\"Father Serra's Church\\" at Mission San Juan Capistrano, is one of only two surviving buildings where Junpero Serra is known to have officiated (although \\"Dolores\\" was still under construction at the time of Serra's visit). In 1817, Mission San Rafael Arcngel was established as an Asistencia to act as a hospital for the Mission, though it would later be granted full mission status in 1822. The Mexican War of Independence (1810ÿ1821) strained relations between the Mexican government and the California missions. Supplies were scant, and the Indians who worked at the missions continued to suffer terrible losses from disease and cultural disruption (more than 5,000 Indians are thought to have been buried in the cemetery adjacent to the Mission). In 1834, the Mexican government enacted secularization laws whereby most church properties were sold or granted to private owners. In practical terms, this meant that the missions would hold title only to the churches, the residences of the priests and a small amount of land surrounding the church for use as gardens. In the period that followed, Mission Dolores fell on very hard times. By 1842, only eight Christian Indians were living at the Mission.[13]\\r\\nThe California Gold Rush brought renewed activity to the Mission Dolores area. In the 1850s, two plank roads were constructed from what is today downtown San Francisco to the Mission, and the entire area became a popular resort and entertainment district.[14] Some of the Mission properties were sold or leased for use as saloons and gambling halls. Racetracks were constructed, and fights between bulls and bears were staged for crowds. The Mission complex also underwent alterations. Part of the Convento was converted to a two-story wooden wing for use as a seminary and priests' quarters, while another section became the \\"Mansion House,\\" a popular tavern and way station for travelers.[15] By 1876, the Mansion House portion of the Convento had been razed and replaced with a large Gothic Revival brick church, designed to serve the growing population of immigrants who were now making the Mission area their home.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring this period, wood clapboard siding was applied to the original adobe chapel walls as both a cosmetic and a protective measure; the veneer was later removed when the Mission was restored. During the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the adjacent brick church was destroyed. By contrast, the original adobe Mission, though damaged, remained in relatively good condition. However, the ensuing fire touched off by the earthquake reached almost to the Mission's doorstep. To prevent the spread of flames, the Convent and School of Notre Dame across the street was dynamited by firefighters; nevertheless, nearly all the blocks east of Dolores Street and north of 20th street were consumed by flames. In 1913, construction began on a new church (now known as the Mission Dolores Basilica) adjacent to the Mission, which was completed in 1918. This structure was further remodeled in 1926 with churrigueresque ornamentation inspired by the Panama-California Exposition held in San Diego's Balboa Park. A sensitive restoration of the original adobe Mission was undertaken in 1917 by architect Willis Polk. In 1952, San Francisco Archbishop John J. Mitty, announced that Pope Pius XII had elevated Mission Dolores to the status of a Minor Basilica. This was the first designation of a basilica west of the Mississippi and the fifth basilica named in the United States. Today, the larger, newer church is called \\"Mission Dolores Basilica\\" while the original adobe structure retains the name of Mission Dolores.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe San Francisco de Ass cemetery, which adjoins the property on the south side, was originally much larger than its present boundaries, running west almost to Church Street and north into what is today 16th Street. It was reduced in various stages, starting with the extension of 16th Street through the former mission grounds in 1889, and later by the construction of the Mission Dolores Basilica Center and the Chancery Building of the Archdiocese of San Francisco in the 1950s. Some remains were reburied on-site in a mass grave, while others were relocated to various Bay Area cemeteries. Today, most of the former cemetery grounds are covered by a paved playground behind the Mission Dolores School. The cemetery that currently remains underwent a careful restoration in the mid-1990s. The mission is still an active church, and hosts mass and other services in the mission church and the larger adjacent basilica. The mission is open to visitors, and is located on Dolores Street near its intersection with 16th Street. The San Francisco neighborhood closely surrounding the historic Mission is known as Mission Dolores, and the much larger Mission District is named for it as well. The current Pastor of Mission Dolores is Reverend Francis Mark P. Garbo. The current Curator of Mission Dolores is Andrew A. Galvan.[citation needed]\\r\\nA full-length portrait sculpture of Junpero Serra is on the property of the mission. The cast stone sculpture, by Arthur Putnam, was completed in 1909, cast between 1916ÿ1917 and installed in 1918 when the mission was remodeled. Funding for the piece came from D.J. McQuarry and it cost $500 to cast. It is approximately H. 6?ft. 6 in. The sculpture depicts Serra wearing a monk's robe belted at the waist with a knotted rope and a rosary around his neck. He looks down, with his head bowed and eyes downward. The sculpture is on a concrete base. It is one of a series of allegorical figures commissioned by the estate of E. W. Scripps to depict California history. In 1993 it was examined by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program. The program determined that the sculpture was well maintained.[20]","input":"Who helped build mission san francisco de asis?"},{"output":"James Murphy","context":"LCD Soundsystem is an American rock band from Brooklyn, New York, formed in 2002.

The cover was released as a single through the Domino Recording Company on April 11, 2011.[56] On April 12, 2011, Murphy confirmed, via LCD Soundsystem's Facebook page, the release of the final show on DVD, with a better quality than the stream offered by Pitchfork.[57][58] In addition, a documentary called Shut Up and Play the Hits, chronicling James Murphy during the 48 hours before and after the final show, screened at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and later given limited release in select theaters.\\r\\nOn March 5, 2013, LCD Soundsystem was named one of Rolling Stones New Immortals\\"currently active (or relatively recently defunct) artists who [they] think will stand the test of time.\\" [59] On April 19, 2014, the definitive live recording of the farewell show, The Long Goodbye: LCD Soundsystem Live at Madison Square Garden, was released in a 5-box vinyl edition.\\r\\nIn October 2015, a Consequence of Sound article reported that \\"multiple sources\\" confirmed that LCD Soundsystem would be reuniting in 2016 and headlining \\"high-profile music festivals in the US and UK\\". This report was eventually confirmed by Billboard, but later that day, DFA Records label manager Kris Petersen confirmed that LCD Soundsystem would not be reuniting. DFA co-founder Jonathan Galkin also confirmed in a Pitchfork article that the band would not be reuniting.[60][61]\\r\\nOn December 24, 2015, LCD Soundsystem released the Christmas-themed track \\"Christmas Will Break Your Heart\\", acting as the band's first single in four years. Regarded as a \\"depressing Christmas song\\" that James Murphy had been singing to himself for years, the song was recorded during 2015 after Murphy had gotten past band members Al Doyle, Pat Mahoney, Nancy Whang, and Tyler Pope to come to DFA Studios in New York City to record the track.[62][63] It was released as both a digital download[64] and 7-inch vinyl.[65] Both Consequence of Sound and Billboard again stated, after the release of the song, that \\"multiple sources\\" can confirm that LCD Soundsystem would reunite in 2016.[66][67]\\r\\nOn January 4, 2016, the band's reunion was confirmed when it was announced that LCD Soundsystem would be headlining the 2016 Coachella Festival.[68][69] The following day, the band announced that they would be releasing a new studio album some time in 2016.[70] On February 13, it was reported that LCD Soundsystem had signed with Columbia Records.[71][72] On March 23, it was announced that the band would also be headlining the 2016 Lollapalooza Festival.[73] The band performed two shows at Webster Hall in East Village, Manhattan on March 27 and 28, officially marking their first shows in almost five years. The event had a ticket distribution system in the form of a lottery.[74] During the rest of 2016, the band headlined the Outside Lands,[75] Austin City Limits,[76] Bonnaroo, LouFest,[77] and Wayhome[78] festivals.\\r\\nIn August 2016, the band canceled tour dates for shows in Asia and Australia in order to complete work on the album. Although plans were made to release the record in 2016, it was suggested that the release date would be moved into the following year, as the recording was predicted to take another few months.[79] LCD Soundsystem performed their first show of 2017 at the then-recently opened venue Brooklyn Steel on April 6. During their performance, they premiered three new songs titled \\"tonite\\", \\"call the police\\", and \\"american dream\\" during the first encore of their set.[80] A fourth new song, \\"emotional haircut\\", was performed during a later show at Brooklyn Steel.[81] On May 5, the band released \\"Call the Police\\" and \\"American Dream\\" together as a digital double A-side single.[82] Accompanying the single was a lengthy post on their official Facebook page, which also included an update regarding the progress of their upcoming studio album.[83] The band performed the two songs during the May 6 episode of Saturday Night Live's 42nd season.[84]\\r\\nOn June 19, the band revealed that the title of their fourth studio album is American Dream and that it will be released on September 1 through Columbia Records and DFA Records.

Built in the late 1920s by silent film star Harold Lloyd, it remained Lloyd's home until his death in 1971. The estate originally consisted of a 44-room mansion, golf course, outbuildings, and 900-foot (270?m) canoe run on 15 acres (61,000?m2). Greenacres has been called \\"the most impressive movie star's estate ever created.\\"[3] After Lloyd died, the acreage in the lower part of the estate along Benedict canyon was subdivided into approximately 14 large home lots. The mansion, on top of its own hill, retained approximately 5 original acres of flat land. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1923, Lloyd purchased a historic home site from P.E. Benedict at the mouth of Benedict Canyon in Beverly Hills, California.[4] The land had been owned by the Benedict family for more than sixty years and was close to the spot where Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks had built their famed Pickfair estate.[4]\\r\\nIn 1925, Lloyd hired architect Sumner Spaulding of the firm Webber, Staunton & Spaulding, after an introduction by landscape architect A.E. Hanson, to design a house on the property.[5] Lloyd also hired Hanson to landscape the 15-acre (61,000?m2) grounds.[6]\\r\\nThe final plans for the house were not completed until July 1927, at which time the Los Angeles Times published the architectural drawing. The home was designed in the Italian Renaissance Mediterranean Revival style: modeled after the Villa Palmieri near Florence.[7] Construction of the mansion began in July 1927 and was completed in 1928.[7]\\r\\nThe 44-room, 45,000-square-foot (4,200?m2) house and estate was said to have cost $2 million.[8]\\r\\nA.E. Hanson, Lloyd's landscape architect, transformed the 15-acre (61,000?m2) site with the Villa Lante and Villa Medici as inspiration in Mediterranean Revival and Spanish Revival style motifs. The Los Angeles Times published a full-page illustrated article describing it as a \\"gorgeous fairyland playground\\" and a \\"Modern Eden of groves and gardens.\\"[6] The elaborated design of the grounds' landscape and gardens included the following elements:\\r\\nThe landscaping project was so large that 3,500 tons of sandstone were taken from quarries in Chatsworth and trucked to the site for use in building the steps, terraces, and waterfalls.[10]\\r\\nAn unusual feature was the separate fairyland estate that Lloyd and A.E. Hanson designed for Lloyd's four-year-old daughter, Mildred Gloria. The play village had its own private gate with a sign reading, \\"Come into my garden and play.\\"[11] The fairyland estate included a four-room miniature old English house, a miniature old English stable with a pony and cart, Great Dane dogs, a wishing well with water for the daughter's garden, a slide, acrobatic devices and a swing.[11] The miniature house had electricity and a kitchen and bath with running water, where the Lloyds' daughter played with friends, including Shirley Temple.\\r\\nLloyd named his estate Greenacres, and it became a gathering place for the Lloyds' family and friends. Sundays were known as \\"at home\\" day at Greenacres:\\r\\nThe 'at home' day at Greenacres was Sunday when 30 or 40 friends would gather in the afternoon, amuse themselves with golf, tennis or handball, swimming, or with leisurely strolls through the gardens. A buffet would be set in the formal dining room and in the evening Lloyd would show a movie. Then he would wave everyone goodnight.[12]\\r\\nIn 1937, Mrs. Lloyd hosted a bridal shower at the estate for Jeanette MacDonald attended by Hollywood's elite, including Ginger Rogers, Mary Pickford, Irene Dunne, Fay Wray, Norma Shearer, Dolores del Ro, Loretta Young, Mervyn LeRoy, Ernst Lubitsch, Hal Roach and Darryl Zanuck.[13]\\r\\nGreenacres was built in the 1920s in Beverly Hills, one of Los Angeles's all-white planned communities.[14] The area had restrictive covenants prohibiting non-whites (this also included Jews[15]) from living there unless they were in the employment of a white resident (typically as a domestic servant).[16]:57 In 1940, Lloyd supported a neighborhood improvement association in Beverly Hills that attempted to enforce the all-white covenant in court after a number of black actors and businessmen had begun buying properties in the area. However, in his decision, federal judge Thurmond Clarke dismissed the action stating that it was time that \\"members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations or evasions, the full rights guaranteed to them under the 14th amendment.\\"[17] In 1948 the United States Supreme Court declared in Shelley v. Kraemer that all racially restrictive covenants in the United States were unenforceable.[18]\\r\\nWith the demise of his movie career and loss of income, Lloyd had difficulty maintaining the estate. In 1943 he petitioned the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to reduce his property taxes because, although he and his family wanted to continue living there, he said the taxes were \\"eating them out of house and home.\\"[19] The Board refused to reduce the $58,730 assessed valuation of the 15 acres (61,000?m2) estate but it did limit the $119,840 valuation of the improvements to $100,000 per annum.[19] Lloyd was forced to reduce the estate's staff, and parts of the estate began to deteriorate from neglect.[12]\\r\\nIn 1943, one of his two film vaults on the estate - containing original negatives and prints - caught fire. According to his granddaughter Suzanne,[citation needed] Lloyd valiantly rescued as much material as he could before the vault was engulfed in flames.\\r\\nIn his later years, Lloyd lived a private life on his estate. He would start each day with a jog around the grounds, followed by a swim in the pool.[12] He also developed an \\"addiction to stereo that shook the mansion at 3 am with the force of 10 speakers in unison\\"; the decibel levels caused the gold leaf to fall from the ornate living room ceiling.[12]\\r\\nLloyd lived at the estate until he died of cancer in 1971, aged 77. A long-time member of staff noted that he had a superstitious fear of being driven around the Italian fountain in the estate's front court, always making his chauffeur back up rather than circle the fountain. However, \\"the only time he ever went around that fountain was the night he died.\\"[20]\\r\\nLloyd left his Benedict Canyon estate to the \\"benefit of the public at large\\" with instructions that it be used \\"as an educational facility and museum for research into the history of the motion picture in the United States.\\"[21] For a few years the home was open to public tours, but financial and legal obstacles prevented the estate from creating the motion picture museum that Lloyd had intended. Among other things, neighboring homeowners in the wealthy community were opposed to the creation of a museum hosting parties and attracting busloads of tourists.[8][22]\\r\\nIn October 1972, the Los Angeles Times visited the property and noted that it had \\"the feel of Sunset Boulevard,\\" bringing to mind the line spoken by the young writer when he first visits Norma Desmond's home: \\"It was the kind of place that crazy movie people built in the crazy 20s.\\"[12] The house appeared to visitors in the 1970s to be frozen in time at 1929. One writer noted that nothing had been moved or replaced, changed, or modernized, from the books in the library to the appliances in the kitchen and the fixtures in the bathrooms.[12] Noted columnist Jack Smith visited the estate in 1973 and wrote that \\"time stood still\\", as Lloyd's clothes still hung in his closet, and the master bedroom and living room \\"looked like a set for a movie of the 1930s.\\"[20] A Renaissance tapestry presented to Lloyd as a housewarming gift by Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks was still hanging in the hallway.[12]\\r\\nThe house also had Lloyd's permanent Christmas tree loaded with ornaments at the end of a long sitting room.[12] Jack Smith described the tree as follows:\\r\\n\\"[A]t the end of the room, dominating it like some great Athena in a Greek temple, stood the most fantastic Christmas tree I had ever seen. It reached the ceiling, a great, bulbous mass of colored glass baubles, some of them as big as pumpkins, clustered together like gaudy jewels in some monstrous piece of costume jewelry.\\"[20]\\r\\nUnable to establish a museum, the estate was sold at auction in 1975.[8] The entire property, including grounds and furnishings, was purchased by a retired Iranian businessman, Nasrollah Afshani, for $1.6 million ÿ $400,000 less than Lloyd had spent to build the estate 50 years earlier.[23][24] Afshani subdivided the estate into approximately 15 lots in addition to the mansion, with individual lots selling for as much as $1.2 million.[25]\\r\\nThe mansion was preserved on a smaller 5-acre (20,000?m2) parcel and sold for $3 million in 1979 to Bernard C. Solomon, the president of Everest Record Group.[25] In 1986, Ted Field, heir to the Marshall Field department store chain and head of Interscope Films, bought the property for $6.5 million and lived there with his wife and their three children. The Fields extensively updated and renovated the entire home and grounds and added a pool back to the site. (The original pool located down closer to Benedict Canyon had been lost in the 1975 subdividing of the property.) Restoring everything except the original theater-size forty-rank pipe organ (which remains today behind the walls of the 80-foot (24?m) living room), the Field family replaced all the electrical wiring and plumbing and modernized the kitchens and bathrooms before moving into the estate. An 80-year-old carousel with hand-carved horses was added to the children's play yard and the same security system used at the White House.[26]\\r\\nField hosted a gala political fundraiser for Bill Clinton and Al Gore at the estate in 1992 where Barbra Streisand performed a concert in the formal garden for 1,200 of Hollywood's most influential, including Warren Beatty, and a relatively unknown heavy contributor Ron Burkle, who would end up buying the property the next year.[27] In 1993, billionaire and Democratic Party fundraiser Ron Burkle bought the home for $20 million ÿ $19 million less than the $39 million asking price (which had included a valuable art collection of old masters paintings in the original asking price) but still among the highest prices paid for a home in the United States in the previous three years.[27][28] On May 20, 1994, the estate hosted yet another gala fundraiser attended by President Bill Clinton at which R&B singer Natalie Cole performed.\\r\\nIn 2001, the mansion was estimated to be worth $50ÿ60 million.[29]\\r\\nThe main house and the estate's principal gardens are frequently used for civic fundraising events and as a filming location, appearing in films such as in Commando, and Westworld.[30]","input":"1740 green acres drive beverly hills california usa?"},{"output":"30 November 1878","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Advance Australia Fair\\" is the national anthem of Australia. Created by the Scottish-born composer Peter Dodds McCormick, the song was first performed in 1878 and sung in Australia as a patriotic song. It replaced \\"God Save the Queen\\" as the official national anthem in 1984, following a plebiscite to choose the national song in 1977. Other songs and marches have been influenced by \\"Advance Australia Fair\\", such as the Australian vice-regal salute.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Advance Australia Fair\\" was composed in the late 19th century by Peter Dodds McCormick under the pen-name \\"Amicus\\" (which means \\"friend\\" in Latin). It was first performed by Andrew Fairfax at a function of the Highland Society of New South Wales in Sydney on 30 November 1878. The song quickly gained popularity and an amended version was sung by a choir of around 10,000 at the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901. In 1907 the Australian Government awarded McCormick S100 for his composition.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a letter to R.B. Fuller, dated 1 August 1913, McCormick described the circumstances that inspired him to write \\"Advance Australia Fair\\":\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night I attended a great concert in the Exhibition Building, when all the National Anthems of the world were to be sung by a large choir with band accompaniment. This was very nicely done, but I felt very aggravated that there was not one note for Australia. On the way home in a bus, I concocted the first verse of my song & when I got home I set it to music. I first wrote it in the Tonic Sol-fa notation, then transcribed it into the Old Notation, & I tried it over on an instrument next morning, & found it correct. Strange to say there has not been a note of it altered since. Some alteration has been made in the wording, but the sense is the same. It seemed to me to be like an inspiration, & I wrote the words & music with the greatest ease.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest known sound recording of \\"Advance Australia Fair\\" appears in The Landing of the Australian Troops in Egypt (circa 1916), a short commercial recording dramatising the arrival of Australian troops in Egypt en route to Gallipoli.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore its adoption as Australia's national anthem, \\"Advance Australia Fair\\" had considerable use elsewhere. For example, Australia's national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, used it to announce its news bulletins until 1952.[4] It was also frequently played at the start or end of official functions. Towards the end of World War II it was one of three songs played in certain picture theatres, along with \\"God Save the King\\" and the US national anthem.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1951 there was a competition for a new national anthem to celebrate the golden jubilee of the Federation of Australia.  The entry by the Austrian-born conductor Henry Krips, \\"This Land of Mine\\", won the competition but it was decided to make no change to the status quo.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 1974 \\"God Save the Queen\\" was Australia's national anthem. In 1973 the Whitlam government decided that the country needed an anthem that could represent Australia with \\"distinction\\" and started a competition to find one. This decision by Whitlam was driven by the desire to forge a new nationalism separate from Great Britain. In 1973, Gough Whitlam dedicated an entire Australia Day speech to the search for a new anthem saying that it will be a \\"symbolic expression of our national pride and dignity\\".[7] The Australia Council for the Arts organised the contest, which was dubbed the \\"Australian National Anthem Quest\\". The contest was held in two stages, the first seeking lyrics and the second music, each having an A$5,000 prize for the winning entry. On the recommendation of the Council for the Arts, none of the new entries were felt worthy enough, so the contest ended with the suggestions for \\"Advance Australia Fair\\", \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" and \\"Song of Australia\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974 the Whitlam government then performed a nationwide opinion survey to determine the song to be sung on occasions of national significance. Conducted through the Australian Bureau of Statistics, it polled 60,000 people nationally. \\"Advance Australia Fair\\" was chosen and was enshrined as the national song, to be used on all occasions excepting those of a specifically regal nature. A spokesman for the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam stated that the Government regarded the tune primarily as the national anthem.  During the 1975 election campaign following the dismissal of Whitlam by Sir John Kerr, it was proposed by David Combe that the song be played at the start of the Labor Party's official campaign launch on 24 November 1975 at Festival Hall, Melbourne. Whitlam's speechwriter Graham Freudenberg rejected this idea, on two grounds, one of which was that the status of the anthem was still tentative.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1976 the Fraser government reinstated \\"God Save the Queen\\" for royal, vice-regal, defence and loyal toast occasions as well as making plans to conduct a national poll to find a song for use on ceremonial occasions when it was desired to mark a separate Australian identity. This was conducted as a plebiscite to choose the National Song, held as an optional additional question in the 1977 referendum on various issues. \\"Advance Australia Fair\\" received 43.29% of the vote, defeating the three alternatives, \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" (28.28%), \\"Song of Australia\\" (9.65%) and the existing national anthem, \\"God Save the Queen\\" (18.78%).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Advance Australia Fair\\", with modified lyrics from the original (see development of lyrics), was adopted as the Australian national anthem on 19 April 1984 by a proclamation by the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen,[11] on a recommendation by the Labor government of Bob Hawke. \\"God Save the Queen\\", now known as the royal anthem, continues to be played alongside the Australian national anthem at public engagements in Australia that are attended by the Queen or members of the Royal Family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lyrics of \\"Advance Australia Fair\\" were officially adopted in 1984 as follows:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralians all let us rejoice,\\r\\nFor we are young and free;\\r\\nWe've golden soil and wealth for toil;\\r\\nOur home is girt by sea;\\r\\nOur land abounds in nature's gifts\\r\\nOf beauty rich and rare;\\r\\nIn history's page, let every stage\\r\\nAdvance Australia Fair.\\r\\nIn joyful strains then let us sing,\\r\\nAdvance Australia Fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeneath our radiant Southern Cross\\r\\nWe'll toil with hearts and hands;\\r\\nTo make this Commonwealth of ours\\r\\nRenowned of all the lands;\\r\\nFor those who've come across the seas\\r\\nWe've boundless plains to share;\\r\\nWith courage let us all combine\\r\\nTo Advance Australia Fair.\\r\\nIn joyful strains then let us sing,\\r\\nAdvance Australia Fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though any copyright of Peter Dodds McCormick's original lyrics has expired, as he died in 1916, the Commonwealth of Australia claims copyright on the official lyrics and particular arrangements of music. Non-commercial use of the anthem is permitted without case-by-case permission, but the Commonwealth government requires permission for commercial use.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wordless orchestral version of \\"Advance Australia Fair\\" that is now regularly played for Australian victories at international sporting medal ceremonies, and at the openings of major domestic sporting, cultural and community events, is by Tommy Tycho, an immigrant from Hungary. It was first commissioned by ABC Records in 1984 and then televised by Channel 10 in 1986 in their Australia Day Broadcast, featuring Julie Anthony as the soloist.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the original lyrics were written in 1879, there have been several changes, in some cases with the intent of increasing the anthem's inclusiveness and gender neutrality. Some of these were minor while others have significantly changed the song. The original song was four verses long. For its adoption as the national anthem, the song was cut from four verses to two. The first verse was kept largely as the 1879 original, except for the change in the first line from \\"Australia's sons let us rejoice\\" to \\"Australians all let us rejoice\\".[12] The second, third and fourth verses of the original were dropped, in favour of a modified version of the new third verse which was sung at Federation in 1901.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original lyrics published in 1879 were as follows:[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia's sons let us rejoice,\\r\\nFor we are young and free;\\r\\nWe've golden soil and wealth for toil,\\r\\nOur home is girt by sea;\\r\\nOur land abounds in Nature's gifts\\r\\nOf beauty rich and rare;\\r\\nIn hist'ry's page, let ev'ry stage\\r\\nAdvance Australia fair.\\r\\nIn joyful strains then let us sing,\\r\\nAdvance Australia fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen gallant Cook from Albion sailed,\\r\\nTo trace wide oceans o'er,\\r\\nTrue British courage bore him on,\\r\\nTil he landed on our shore.\\r\\nThen here he raised Old England's flag,\\r\\nThe standard of the brave;\\r\\n\\"With all her faults we love her still\\"\\r\\n\\"Britannia rules the wave.\\"\\r\\nIn joyful strains then let us sing\\r\\nAdvance Australia fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile other nations of the globe\\r\\nBehold us from afar,\\r\\nWe'll rise to high renown and shine\\r\\nLike our glorious southern star;\\r\\nFrom England soil and Fatherland,\\r\\nScotia and Erin fair,\\r\\nLet all combine with heart and hand\\r\\nTo advance Australia fair.\\r\\nIn joyful strains then let us sing\\r\\nAdvance Australia fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould foreign foe e'er sight our coast,\\r\\nOr dare a foot to land,\\r\\nWe'll rouse to arms like sires of yore,\\r\\nTo guard our native strand;\\r\\nBritannia then shall surely know,\\r\\nThough oceans roll between,\\r\\nHer sons in fair Australia's land\\r\\nStill keep their courage green.\\r\\nIn joyful strains then let us sing\\r\\nAdvance Australia fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1901 Federation version of the third verse was originally sung as:\\r\\n\\r\\nBeneath our radiant Southern Cross,\\r\\nWe'll toil with hearts and hands;\\r\\nTo make our youthful Commonwealth,\\r\\nRenowned of all the lands;\\r\\nFor loyal sons beyond the seas\\r\\nWe've boundless plains to share;\\r\\nWith courage let us all combine\\r\\nTo advance Australia fair.\\r\\nIn joyful strains then let us sing\\r\\nAdvance Australia fair!\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the lyrics and melody of the Australian national anthem have been criticised in some quarters as being dull and unendearing to the Australian people. A National Party senator, Sandy Macdonald, said in 2001 that \\"Advance Australia Fair\\" is so boring that the nation risks singing itself to sleep, with boring music and words impossible to understand.[17]  A parliamentary colleague, Peter Slipper, said that Australia should consider another anthem.[18] One suggested replacement was \\"I Am Australian\\", notably in 2011 by former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecific criticism is also directed at the fourth line of lyrics, \\"our home is girt by sea\\", for its use of the archaic word \\"girt\\" to acknowledge the fact that Australia is an island.[20] The current version of the anthem has a mix of old and new language, rather than having one style of language consistently throughout. Criticism has come from various people, including Australian Labor Party politician Craig Emerson,[21] but others, including former Labor leader Kim Beazley, have defended it.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe line \\"for we are young and free\\" has been criticised by a Victorian judge who said that many indigenous Australians find the words offensive.[23]  Australian Aboriginal soprano, Deborah Cheetham, has refused to sing \\"Advance Australia Fair\\" at the AFL grand finals, citing this lyric, and has advocated for the lyrics to be rewritten.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nA variant of the national anthem penned in 1988 by Sri Lankan immigrant Ruth Ponniah and sung in some Christian schools replaces the second verse with the following:[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Christ our head and cornerstone, \\r\\nWe'll build our nation's might;\\r\\nWhose way and truth and light alone, \\r\\nCan guide our path aright;\\r\\nOur lives a sacrifice of love, \\r\\nReflect our master's care;\\r\\nWith faces turned to heav'n above, \\r\\nAdvance Australia Fair;\\r\\nIn joyful strains then let us sing, \\r\\nAdvance Australia Fair.","input":"When was the australian national anthem first performed?"},{"output":"When Solomon's successor Rehoboam dealt tactlessly with economic complaints of the northern tribes, in about 930 BCE (there are differences of opinion as to the actual year) the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah split into two kingdoms","context":"The United Monarchy (Hebrew: ?????? ????????) is the name given to the Israelite[note 1] kingdom of Israel and Judah,[2][3][4] during the reigns of Saul, David and Solomon, as depicted in the Hebrew Bible. This is traditionally dated between 1050 BCE and 930 BCE. On the succession of Solomon's son, Rehoboam, around 930 BCE, the biblical account reports that the country split into two kingdoms: the Kingdom of Israel (including the cities of Shechem and Samaria) in the north and the Kingdom of Judah (containing Jerusalem) in the south.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contemporary scholarship the united monarchy is general held to be a literary construction and not a historical reality, due to the lack of archeological evidence for it. It is generally accepted that a \\"House of David\\" existed, but many believe that David could have only been the monarch or chieftain of Judah, which was likely small, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development. There are some dissenters to this view.[5] [6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to standard source criticism, a number of distinct source texts were spliced together to produce the current books of Samuel.[8] The most prominent in the early parts of the first book are the pro-monarchical source and the anti-monarchical source. In identifying these two sources, two separate accounts can be reconstructed. The anti-monarchical source describes Samuel as having thoroughly routed the Philistines, yet begrudgingly accepting the people's demand for a ruler, subsequently appointing Saul by cleromancy.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pro-monarchical source describes the divinely appointed birth of Saul (a single word being changed by a later editor so that it referred to Samuel instead), and his leading of an army to victory over the Ammonites, resulted in the clamouring of the people for him to lead them against the Philistines, whereupon he is appointed king.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nTextual critics also point to disparities in the account of David's rise to power as indicative of separate threads being merged later to create a golden age of a united monarchy. David is thought by scholars to have been a ruler in Judah, while Israel, comparatively immense and highly developed, continued unfettered. Modern archaeology also supports this view.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost scholars believe the Books of Samuel exhibit too many anachronisms to have been a contemporary account. For example, there is mention of later armor (1 Samuel 17:4ÿ7, 38ÿ39; 25:13), use of camels (1 Samuel 30:17), cavalry (as distinct from chariotry) (1 Samuel 13:5, 2 Samuel 1:6), and iron picks and axes (as though they were common) (2 Samuel 12:31). The historicity of the conquest described in the Book of Samuel is not attested, and many scholars regard this conquest as legendary in origin, particularly given the lack of evidence for the battles described involving the destruction of the Canaanite peoples. Most scholars believe that Samuel was compiled in the 8th century BCE (rather than the 10th century when most of the events described take place) based on both historical and legendary sources, primarily serving to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events described in Deuteronomy. This gap in the historical record is characteristic of the Late Bronze Age collapse; cultural memories of times before the disaster often became embellished as stories of a \\"lost golden age\\", as in the Trojan Epic Cycle.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Book of Judges, before the rise of the united monarchy the Israelite tribes lived as a confederation under ad hoc charismatic leaders called judges. Abimelech the first judge to be declared king by the men of Shechem and the house of Millo,[10] reigned over Israel for three years before he was killed during the Battle of Thebez.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the biblical account, the united monarchy was formed when there was a large popular expression in favour of introducing a king to rule over the decentralised Israelite confederacy. Increasing pressure from the Philistines and other neighboring peoples is said by the Bible to have forced the Israelites to unite as state following the anointing of Saul by Samuel. The Bible treats the notion of kingship as having been anathema, it being viewed as the placing of one man in a position of reverence and power that ought to be  reserved for God.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid and Saul become bitter enemies, at least from Saul's point of view, although sources describe Jonathan, Saul's son, and Michal, Saul's daughter, as assisting David to escape Saul, ultimately leading to a brief reconciliation before Saul's death.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Second Book of Samuel, Saul's disobedience prompts God to curtail his reign and hand his kingdom over to another dynasty. Saul dies in battle against the Philistines[citation needed] after a reign of just two years.[12] His heir, Ishbaal, rules for only two years before being assassinated. David, heretofore king of Judah only, ends the conspiracy and is appointed king of Israel in Ishbaal's place. Some textual critics and biblical scholars suggest that David was actually responsible for the assassination and that David's innocence was a later invention to legitimize his actions.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIsrael rebels against David and appoints David's son Absalom king, forcing David into exile east of the Jordan.[citation needed] David eventually launches a successful counterattack that results in the loss of Absalom. Having retaken Judah and asserted control over Israel, David returns west of the Jordan. Throughout the remainder of his reign, he continues to suppress rebellions that arise among the people of Israel.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis section of the biblical text, and the bulk of the remainder of the Books of Samuel, is thought by textual critics to belong to a single large source known as the Court History of David. Although reflecting the political bias of the kingdom of Judah following the destruction of Israel, the source remains somewhat more neutral than the pro- and antimonarchical sources comprising earlier parts of the text. Israel and Judah are portrayed in this source as quite distinct kingdoms.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the ascension of Saul, the city of Shiloh is seen as the national capital, at least in the religious sense, a claim that from an archaeological standpoint is considered plausible. Throughout the united monarchy of Saul, the capital is located in Gibeah. After Saul's death, Ish-baal rules over the kingdom of Israel from Mahanaim, while David establishes the capital of the kingdom of Judah in Hebron.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the civil war with Saul, David forges a strong and unified Israelite monarchy, reigning c. 1000 to 961 BCE[14] and establishing Jerusalem as his national capital in 1006 BCE.[15] Some modern archaeologists, however, believe that the two distinct cultures and geographic entities of Judah and Israel continued uninterrupted, and that if a political union between them did exist, it possibly had no practical effect on their relationship.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the biblical account, David embarks on successful military campaigns against the enemies of Judah and Israel, defeating such regional entities as the Philistines to secure his borders. Israel grows from kingdom to empire, its sphere of influencemilitarily and politicallyexpanding to control the weaker client states of Philistia, Moab, Edom and Ammon, with Aramaean city-states Aram-Zobah and Aram-Damascus becoming vassal states.[16] The imperial border is described as stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arabian Desert, from the Red Sea to the Euphrates River. Some modern archaeologists believe that the area under the control of Judah and Israel, excluding the Phoenician territories on the shore of the Mediterranean, did not exceed 34,000 square kilometres (13,000 sq mi), of which the kingdom of Israel encompassed about 24,000 square kilometres (9,300?sq?mi).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid is succeeded by his son Solomon (Hebrew: ?????????, \\"peace\\"), who obtains the throne in a somewhat disreputable manner from rival claimant Adonijah, his elder brother.[citation needed] The reign of Solomon (c. 961 to 922 BCE)[14] proves to be a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and cultural development. Solomon embarks on an aggressive campaign of public building, erecting the First Temple in Jerusalem with assistance from the King of Tyre, with whom he has maintained the strong alliance forged by his father.[citation needed] Like the palace of David, Solomon's temple is designed and built with the assistance of Tyrian architects, master craftsmen, skilled labourers, money, jewels, cedar, and other goods obtained in exchange for land ceded to Tyre.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolomon goes on to rebuild numerous major cities, including Megiddo, Hazor, and Gezer. Some scholars have attributed aspects of archaeological remains excavated from this sites, including six-chambered gates and ashlar palaces, to this building programme. However, excavation teams at Meggido later established that these structures are from different time periods. Yigael Yadin subsequently concluded that the stables once believed to have served Solomon's vast vast collection of horses were actually built by King Ahab in the 9th century BCE.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Solomon's death in c. 926 BCE, tensions between the northern part of Israel containing the ten northern tribes, and the southern section dominated by Jerusalem and the southern tribes reached boiling point. When Solomon's successor Rehoboam dealt tactlessly with economic complaints of the northern tribes, in about 930 BCE (there are differences of opinion as to the actual year) the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah split into two kingdoms: the northern Kingdom of Israel, which included the cities of Shechem and Samaria, and the southern Kingdom of Judah, which contained Jerusalem; with most of the non-Israelite provinces achieving independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Israel (or Northern Kingdom, or Samaria) existed as an independent state until 722 BCE when it was conquered by the Assyrian Empire, while the Kingdom of Judah (or Southern Kingdom) existed as an independent state until 586 BCE when it was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany alternative chronologies have been suggested, and there is no ultimate consensus between the different factions and scholarly disciplines concerned with this period, as to when it is depicted as having begun or when it ended.[18][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost bibical scholars follow either of the older chronologies established by William F. Albright or Edwin R. Thiele, or the newer chronology of Gershon Galil, all of which are shown below. All dates are BCE. Thiele's chronology generally corresponds with Galil's chronology below with a difference of at most one year.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse of Saul\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse of David\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contemporary scholarship the united monarchy is general held to be a literary construction and not a historical reality, due to the lack of archeological evidence for it. It is generally accepted that a \\"House of David\\" existed, but many believe that David could have only been the monarch or chieftain of Judah, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development. There are some dissenters to this view. \\r\\n\\r\\nOded Lipschits wrote in the Jewish Study Bible that \\"the promonarchic period long ago became a literary description of the mythological roots, the early beginnings of the nation, and the way to describe the right of Isreal on its land.  The archeological evidence also does not support the existence of a united monarchy under David and Solomon as described in the Bible, so the rubric of \\"united monarchy\\" is best abandoned, although it remains useful for discussing how the Bible views the Israelite past.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman, authors of The Bible Unearthed, ideas of a united monarchy are not accurate history but rather \\"creative expressions of a powerful religious reform movement,\\" possibly \\"based on certain historical kernels.\\"[6] Although in a later book Finkelstein and Silberman do accept that David and Solomon were real kings of Judah about the 10th century BCE, they cite the fact that the earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel dates to about 890 BCE, while that for the kingdom of Judah dates to about 750 BCE.[22] This is supported by Jonathan Tubb, who argues that the story of the united monarchy was fabricated as a Golden Age tale during the Exile. He accepts the historicity of David and Solomon but cautions that \\"[t]hey must be seen . . . as local folk heroes and not as rulers of international status.\\"[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, while Kuhrt does acknowledge that \\"there are no royal inscriptions from the time of the united monarchy (indeed very little written material altogether), and not a single contemporary reference to either David or Solomon,\\" he concludes that \\"[a]gainst this must be set the evidence for substantial development and growth at several sites, which is plausibly related to the tenth century.\\"[7] Kenneth Kitchen reaches a similar conclusion, arguing that \\"the physical archaeology of tenth-century Canaan is consistent with the former existence of a unified state on its terrain.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nExcavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa, an Iron Age site located in Judah, found an urbanized settlement radiocarbon dated well before scholars such as Finklestein suggest urbanization began in Judah, supporting existence of a Judahite kingdom. The Israel Antiquities Authority stated: \\"The excavations at Khirbat Qeiyafa clearly reveal an urban society that existed in Judah already in the late eleventh century BCE. It can no longer be argued that the Kingdom of Judah developed only in the late eighth century BCE or at some other later date.\\"[25] The techniques and interpretations used to reach some conclusions related to Khirbet Qeiyafa have been criticized by some scholars, among them Finkelstein and Alexander Fantalkin of Tel Aviv University.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2015, Israeli archaeologists discovered massive fortifications in the ruins of the ancient city of Gath, supposed birthplace of Goliath. The size of the fortifications show Gath to have been a very large city in the 10th century BCE, perhaps the largest in Canaan at the time. The professor leading the dig, Aren Maeir, estimated that Gath was as much as four times the size of contemporary Jerusalem, casting doubt that David's kingdom could have been as powerful as described in the Bible.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name . . . signifies the people composed of [Jacob's] descendants (the \\"children of Israel\\"), being applied (a) to the whole people (including Judah) . . . [but] (b) with the division of the kingdom after the death of Solomon, to the Northern Kingdom only.\\"[1]","input":"What caused the split between israel and judah?"},{"output":"Eight","context":"English grammar is the way in which meanings are encoded into wordings in the English language. This includes the structure of words, phrases, clauses, and sentences, right up to the structure of whole texts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are historical, social, cultural and regional variations of English. Divergences from the grammar described here occur in some dialects. This article describes a generalized present-day Standard English ÿ a form of speech and writing used in public discourse, including broadcasting, education, entertainment, government, and news, over a range of registers from formal to informal. There are differences in grammar between the standard forms of British, American, and Australian English, although these are more minor than differences in vocabulary and pronunciation.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system of Indo-European in favor of analytic constructions. The personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class (a remnant of the more extensive Germanic case system of Old English). For other pronouns, and all nouns, adjectives, and articles, grammatical function is indicated only by word order, by prepositions, and by the \\"Saxon genitive or English possessive\\" (-'s).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nEight \\"word classes\\" or \\"parts of speech\\" are commonly distinguished in English: nouns, determiners, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions. Nouns form the largest word class, and verbs the second-largest. Unlike many Indo-European languages, English nouns do not have grammatical gender.\\r\\n\\r\\nNouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs form open classes ÿ word classes that readily accept new members, such as the noun celebutante (a celebrity who frequents the fashion circles), and other similar relatively new words.[2] The others are considered to be closed classes. For example, it is rare for a new pronoun to enter the language. Determiners, traditionally classified along with adjectives, have not always been regarded as a separate part of speech. Interjections are another word class, but these are not described here as they do not form part of the clause and sentence structure of the language.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish words are not generally marked for word class. It is not usually possible to tell from the form of a word which class it belongs to except, to some extent, in the case of words with inflectional endings or derivational suffixes. On the other hand, most words belong to more than one word class. For example, run can serve as either a verb or a noun (these are regarded as two different lexemes).[3] Lexemes may be inflected to express different grammatical categories. The lexeme run has the forms runs, ran, runny, runner, and running.[3]  Words in one class can sometimes be derived from those in another. This has the potential to give rise to new words. The noun aerobics has recently given rise to the adjective aerobicized.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nWords combine to form phrases. A phrase typically serves the same function as a word from some particular word class.[3] For example, my very good friend Peter is a phrase that can be used in a sentence as if it were a noun, and is therefore called a noun phrase. Similarly, adjectival phrases and adverbial phrases function as if they were adjectives or adverbs, but with other types of phrases the terminology has different implications. For example, a verb phrase consists of a verb together with any objects and other dependents; a prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and its complement (linguistics) (and is therefore usually a type of adverbial phrase); and a determiner phrase is a type of noun phrase containing a determiner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many common suffixes used to form nouns from other nouns or from other types of words, such as -age (as in shrinkage), -hood (as in sisterhood), and so on,[3] although many nouns are base forms not containing any such suffix (such as cat, grass, France).  Nouns are also often created by conversion of verbs or adjectives, as with the words talk and reading (a boring talk, the assigned reading).\\r\\n\\r\\nNouns are sometimes classified semantically (by their meanings) as proper nouns and common nouns (Cyrus, China vs. frog, milk) or as concrete nouns and abstract nouns (book, laptop vs. heat, prejudice).[4] A grammatical distinction is often made between count (countable) nouns such as clock and city, and non-count (uncountable) nouns such as milk and decor.[5] Some nouns can function both as countable and as uncountable such as the word \\"wine\\" (This is a good wine, I prefer red wine).\\r\\n\\r\\nCountable nouns generally have singular and plural forms.[4] In most cases the plural is formed from the singular by adding -[e]s (as in dogs, bushes), although there are also irregular forms (woman/women, foot/feet, etc.), including cases where the two forms are identical (sheep, series). For more details, see English plural. Certain nouns can be used with plural verbs even though they are singular in form, as in The government were ... (where the government is considered to refer to the people constituting the government). This is a form of synesis; it is more common in British than American English. See English plural ?Singulars with collective meaning treated as plural.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish nouns are not marked for case as they are in some languages, but they have possessive forms, through the addition of -'s (as in John's, children's) or just an apostrophe (with no change in pronunciation) in the case of -[e]s plurals and sometimes other words ending with -s (the dogs' owners, Jesus' love). More generally, the ending can be applied to noun phrases (as in the man you saw yesterday's sister); see below. The possessive form can be used either as a determiner (John's cat) or as a noun phrase (John's is the one next to Jane's).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe status of the possessive as an affix or a clitic is the subject of debate.[6][7] It differs from the noun inflection of languages such as German, in that the genitive ending may attach to the last word of the phrase. To account for this, the possessive can be analysed, for instance as a clitic construction (an \\"enclitic postposition\\"[8]) or as an inflection[9][10] of the last word of a phrase (\\"edge inflection\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nNoun phrases are phrases that function grammatically as nouns within sentences, for example as the subject or object of a verb. Most noun phrases have a noun as their head.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn English noun phrase typically takes the following form (not all elements need be present):\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this structure:\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of a noun phrase that includes all of the above-mentioned elements is that rather attractive young college student to whom you were talking. Here that is the determiner, rather attractive and young are adjectival pre-modifiers, college is a noun adjunct, student is the noun serving as the head of the phrase, and to whom you were talking is a post-modifier (a relative clause in this case). Notice the order of the pre-modifiers; the determiner that must come first and the noun adjunct college must come after the adjectival modifiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinating conjunctions such as and, or, and but can be used at various levels in noun phrases, as in John, Paul, and Mary; the matching green coat and hat; a dangerous but exciting ride; a person sitting down or standing up. See ?Conjunctions below for more explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNoun phrases can also be placed in apposition (where two consecutive phrases refer to the same thing), as in that president, Abraham Lincoln, ... (where that president and Abraham Lincoln are in apposition). In some contexts the same can be expressed by a prepositional phrase, as in the twin curses of famine and pestilence (meaning \\"the twin curses\\" that are \\"famine and pestilence\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nParticular forms of noun phrases include:\\r\\n\\r\\nA system of grammatical gender, whereby every noun was treated as either masculine, feminine or neuter, existed in Old English, but fell out of use during the Middle English period. Modern English retains features relating to natural gender, namely the use of certain nouns and pronouns (such as he and she) to refer specifically to persons or animals of one or other genders  and certain others (such as it) for sexless objects ÿ although feminine pronouns are sometimes used when referring to ships (and more uncommonly some airplanes and analogous machinery) and nation states.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome aspects of gender usage in English have been influenced by the movement towards a preference for gender-neutral language. Animals are triple-gender nouns, being able to take masculine, feminine and neuter pronouns.[11] Generally there is no difference between male and female in English nouns. However, gender is occasionally exposed by different shapes or dissimilar words when referring to people or animals.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany nouns that mention people's roles and jobs can refer to either a masculine or a feminine subject, for instance \\"cousin\\", \\"teenager\\", \\"teacher\\", \\"doctor\\", \\"student\\", \\"friend\\", and \\"colleague\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOften the gender distinction for these neutral nouns is established by inserting the words \\"male\\" or \\"female\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nRarely, nouns illustrating things with no gender are referred to with a gendered pronoun to convey familiarity. It is also standard to use the gender-neutral pronoun (it).[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish determiners constitute a relatively small class of words. They include the articles the, a[n], certain demonstrative and interrogative words such as this, that, and which, possessives such as my and whose (the role of determiner can also be played by noun possessive forms such as John's and the girl's), various quantifying words like all, some, many, various, and numerals (one, two, etc.). There are also many phrases (such as a couple of) that can play the role of determiners.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeterminers are used in the formation of noun phrases (see above). Many words that serve as determiners can also be used as pronouns (this, that, many, etc.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDeterminers can be used in certain combinations, such as all the water and the many problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many contexts, it is required for a noun phrase to be completed with an article or some other determiner. It is not grammatical to say just cat sat on table; one must say my cat sat on the table. The most common situations in which a complete noun phrase can be formed without a determiner are when it refers generally to a whole class or concept (as in dogs are dangerous and beauty is subjective) and when it is a name (Jane, Spain, etc.) This is discussed in more detail at English articles and Zero article in English.\\r\\n\\r\\nPronouns are a relatively small, closed class of words that function in the place of nouns or noun phrases. They include personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, and some others, mainly indefinite pronouns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe personal pronouns of modern standard English, and the corresponding possessive forms, are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second-person forms such as you are used with both singular and plural reference. In the Southern United States, y'all (you all) is used as a plural form, and various other phrases such as you guys are used in other places. An archaic set of second-person pronouns used for singular reference is thou, thee, thyself, thy, thine, which are still used in religious services and can be seen in older works, such as Shakespeare's - in such texts, the  you set of pronouns are used for plural reference, or with singular reference as a formal V-form. You can also be used as an indefinite pronoun, referring to a person in general (see generic you) compared to the more formal alternative, one (reflexive oneself, possessive one's).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third-person singular forms are differentiated according to the sex of the referent. For example, she is used to refer to a female person, sometimes a female animal, and sometimes an object to which female characteristics are attributed, such as a ship or a country. A male person, and sometimes a male animal, is referred to using he. In other cases it can be used. (See Gender in English.) The word it can also be used as a dummy subject, in sentences like It is going to be sunny this afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third-person plural forms such as they are sometimes used with singular reference, as a gender-neutral pronoun, as in each employee should ensure they tidy their desk. Despite its long history, this usage is sometimes considered ungrammatical. (See singular they.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possessive determiners such as my are used as determiners together with nouns, as in my old man, some of his friends. The second possessive forms like mine are used when they do not qualify a noun: as pronouns, as in mine is bigger than yours, and as predicates, as in this one is mine. Note also the construction a friend of mine (meaning \\"someone who is my friend\\"). See English possessive for more details.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe demonstrative pronouns of English are this (plural these), and that (plural those), as in these are good, I like that. Note that all four words can also be used as determiners (followed by a noun), as in those cars. They can also form the alternative pronominal expressions this/that one, these/those ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interrogative pronouns are who, what, and which (all of them can take the suffix -ever for emphasis). The pronoun who refers to a person or people; it has an oblique form whom (though in informal contexts this is usually replaced by who), and a possessive form (pronoun or determiner) whose. The pronoun what refers to things or abstracts. The word which is used to ask about alternatives from what is seen as a closed set: which (of the books) do you like best? (It can also be an interrogative determiner: which book?; this can form the alternative pronominal expressions which one and which ones.) Which, who, and what can be either singular or plural, although who and what often take a singular verb regardless of any supposed number. For more information see who.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the interrogative pronouns can also be used as relative pronouns; see below for more details.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main relative pronouns in English are who (with its derived forms whom and whose), which, and that.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relative pronoun which refers to things rather than persons, as in the shirt, which used to be red, is faded. For persons, who is used (the man who saw me was tall). The oblique case form of who is whom, as in the man whom I saw was tall, although in informal registers who is commonly used in place of whom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possessive form of who is whose (the man whose car is missing ...); however the use of whose is not restricted to persons (one can say an idea whose time has come).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word that as a relative pronoun is normally found only in restrictive relative clauses (unlike which and who, which can be used in both restrictive and unrestrictive clauses). It can refer to either persons or things, and cannot follow a preposition. For example, one can say the song that [or which] I listened to yesterday, but the song to which [not to that] I listened yesterday. The relative pronoun that is usually pronounced with a reduced vowel (schwa), and hence differently from the demonstrative that (see Weak and strong forms in English). If that is not the subject of the relative clause, it can be omitted (the song I listened to yesterday).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word what can be used to form a free relative clause ÿ one that has no antecedent and that serves as a complete noun phrase in itself, as in I like what he likes. The words whatever and whichever can be used similarly, in the role of either pronouns (whatever he likes) or determiners (whatever book he likes). When referring to persons, who(ever) (and whom(ever)) can be used in a similar way (but not as determiners).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word there is used as a pronoun in some sentences, playing the role of a dummy subject, normally of an intransitive verb. The \\"logical subject\\" of the verb then appears as a complement after the verb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis use of there occurs most commonly with forms of the verb be in existential clauses, to refer to the presence or existence of something. For example: There is a heaven; There are two cups on the table; There have been a lot of problems lately. It can also be used with other verbs: There exist two major variants; There occurred a very strange incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dummy subject takes the number (singular or plural) of the logical subject (complement), hence it takes a plural verb if the complement is plural. In informal English, however, the contraction there's is often used for both singular and plural.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dummy subject can undergo inversion, Is there a test today? and Never has there been a man such as this. It can also appear without a corresponding logical subject, in short sentences and question tags: There wasn't a discussion, was there? There was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word there in such sentences has sometimes been analyzed as an adverb, or as a dummy predicate, rather than as a pronoun.[15] However, its identification as a pronoun is most consistent with its behavior in inverted sentences and question tags as described above.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the word there can also be a deictic adverb (meaning \\"at/to that place\\"), a sentence like There is a river could have either of two meanings: \\"a river exists\\" (with there as a pronoun), and \\"a river is in that place\\" (with there as an adverb). In speech, the adverbial there would be given stress, while the pronoun would not ÿ in fact the pronoun is often pronounced as a weak form, /e?(r)/.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther pronouns in English are often identical in form to determiners (especially quantifiers), such as many, a little, etc. Sometimes, the pronoun form is different, as with none (corresponding to the determiner no), nothing, everyone, somebody, etc. Many examples are listed as indefinite pronouns. Another indefinite (or impersonal) pronoun is one (with its reflexive form oneself and possessive one's), which is a more formal alternative to generic you.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic form of an English verb is not generally marked by any ending, although there are certain suffixes that are frequently used to form verbs, such as -ate (formulate), -fy (electrify), and -ise/ize (realise/realize).[17] Many verbs also contain prefixes, such un- (unmask), out- (outlast), over- (overtake), and under- (undervalue).[17] Verbs can also be formed from nouns and adjectives by zero derivation, as with the verbs snare, nose, dry, and calm.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost verbs have three or four inflected forms in addition to the base form: a third-person singular present tense form in -(e)s (writes, botches), a present participle and gerund form in -ing (writing), a past tense (wrote), and ÿ though often identical to the past tense form ÿ a past participle (written). Regular verbs have identical past tense and past participle forms in -ed, but there are 100 or so irregular English verbs with different forms (see list). The verbs have, do and say also have irregular third-person present tense forms (has, does /d?z/, says /s?z/). The verb be has the largest number of irregular forms (am, is, are in the present tense, was, were in the past tense, been for the past participle).\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of what are often referred to as verb tenses (or sometimes aspects) in English are formed using auxiliary verbs. Apart from what are called the simple present (write, writes) and simple past (wrote), there are also continuous (progressive) forms (am/is/are/was/were writing), perfect forms (have/has/had written, and the perfect continuous have/has/had been writing), future forms (will write, will be writing, will have written, will have been writing), and conditionals (also called \\"future in the past\\") with would in place of will. The auxiliaries shall and should sometimes replace will and would in the first person. For the uses of these various verb forms, see English verbs and English clause syntax.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic form of the verb (be, write, play) is used as the infinitive, although there is also a \\"to-infinitive\\" (to be, to write, to play) used in many syntactical constructions. There are also infinitives corresponding to other aspects: (to) have written, (to) be writing, (to) have been writing. The second-person imperative is identical to the (basic) infinitive; other imperative forms may be made with let (let us go, or let's go; let them eat cake).\\r\\n\\r\\nA form identical to the infinitive can be used as a present subjunctive in certain contexts: It is important that he follow them or ... that he be committed to the cause. There is also a past subjunctive (distinct from the simple past only in the possible use of were instead of was), used in some conditional sentences and similar: if I were (or was) rich ...; were he to arrive now ...; I wish she were (or was) here. For details see English subjunctive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe passive voice is formed using the verb be (in the appropriate tense or form) with the past participle of the verb in question: cars are driven, he was killed, I am being tickled, it is nice to be pampered, etc. The performer of the action may be introduced in a prepositional phrase with by (as in they were killed by the invaders).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English modal verbs consist of the core modals can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would, as well as ought (to), had better, and in some uses dare and need.[18] These do not inflect for person or number,[18] and do not have infinitive or participle forms (except synonyms, as with be/being/been able (to) for the modals can/could). The modals are used with the basic infinitive form of a verb (I can swim, he may be killed, we dare not move, need they go?), except for ought, which takes to (you ought to go).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe copula be, along with the modal verbs and the other auxiliaries, form a distinct class, sometimes called \\"special verbs\\" or simply \\"auxiliaries\\".[19] These have different syntax from ordinary lexical verbs, especially in that they make their interrogative forms by plain inversion with the subject, and their negative forms by adding not after the verb (could I ...? I could not ...). Apart from those already mentioned, this class may also include used to (although the forms did he use to? and he didn't use to are also found), and sometimes have even when not an auxiliary (forms like have you a sister? and he hadn't a clue are possible, though becoming less common). It also includes the auxiliary do (does, did); this is used with the basic infinitive of other verbs (those not belonging to the \\"special verbs\\" class) to make their question and negation forms, as well as emphatic forms (do I like you?; he doesn't speak English; we did close the fridge). For more details of this, see do-support.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome forms of the copula and auxiliaries often appear as contractions, as in I'm for I am, you'd for you would or you had, and John's for John is. Their negated forms with following not are also often contracted (see ?Negation below). For detail see English auxiliaries and contractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nA verb together with its dependents, excluding its subject, may be identified as a verb phrase (although this concept is not acknowledged in all theories of grammar[20]). A verb phrase headed by a finite verb may also be called a predicate. The dependents may be objects, complements, and modifiers (adverbs or adverbial phrases). In English, objects and complements nearly always come after the verb; a direct object precedes other complements such as prepositional phrases, but if there is an indirect object as well, expressed without a preposition, then that precedes the direct object: give me the book, but give the book to me. Adverbial modifiers generally follow objects, although other positions are possible (see under ?Adverbs below). Certain verbÿmodifier combinations, particularly when they have independent meaning (such as take on and get up), are known as \\"phrasal verbs\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFor details of possible patterns, see English clause syntax. See the Non-finite clauses section of that article for verb phrases headed by non-finite verb forms, such as infinitives and participles.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish adjectives, as with other word classes, cannot in general be identified as such by their form,[21] although many of them are formed from nouns or other words by the addition of a suffix, such as -al (habitual), -ful (blissful), -ic (atomic), -ish (impish, youngish), -ous (hazardous), etc.; or from other adjectives using a prefix: disloyal, irredeemable, unforeseen, overtired.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdjectives may be used attributively, as part of a noun phrase (nearly always preceding the noun they modify; for exceptions see postpositive adjective), as in the big house, or predicatively, as in the house is big. Certain adjectives are restricted to one or other use; for example, drunken is attributive (a drunken sailor), while drunk is usually predicative (the sailor was drunk).\\r\\n\\r\\nMany adjectives have comparative and superlative forms in -er and -est,[22] such as faster and fastest (from the positive form fast). Spelling rules which maintain pronunciation apply to suffixing adjectives just as they do for similar treatment of regular past tense formation; these cover consonant doubling (as in bigger and biggest, from big) and the change of y to i after consonants (as in happier and happiest, from happy).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adjectives good and bad have the irregular forms better, best and worse, worst; also far becomes farther, farthest or further, furthest. The adjective old (for which the regular older and oldest are usual) also has the irregular forms elder and eldest, these generally being restricted to use in comparing siblings and in certain independent uses. For the comparison of adverbs, see Adverbs below.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany adjectives, however, particularly those that are longer and less common, do not have inflected comparative and superlative forms. Instead, they can be qualified with more and most, as in beautiful, more beautiful, most beautiful (this construction is also sometimes used even for adjectives for which inflected forms do exist).\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain adjectives are classed as ungradable.[22] These represent properties that cannot be compared on a scale; they simply apply or do not, as with pregnant, dead, unique. Consequently, comparative and superlative forms of such adjectives are not normally used, except in a figurative, humorous or imprecise context. Similarly, such adjectives are not normally qualified with modifiers of degree such as very and fairly, although with some of them it is idiomatic to use adverbs such as completely. Another type of adjectives sometimes considered ungradable is those that represent an extreme degree of some property, such as delicious and terrified.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn adjective phrase is a group of words that plays the role of an adjective in a sentence. It usually has a single adjective as its head, to which modifiers and complements may be added.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdjectives can be modified by a preceding adverb or adverb phrase, as in very warm, truly imposing, more than a little excited. Some can also be preceded by a noun or quantitative phrase, as in fat-free, two-metre-long.\\r\\n\\r\\nComplements following the adjective may include:\\r\\n\\r\\nAn adjective phrase may include both modifiers before the adjective and a complement after it, as in very difficult to put away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdjective phrases containing complements after the adjective cannot normally be used as attributive adjectives before a noun. Sometimes they are used attributively after the noun, as in a woman proud of being a midwife (where they may be converted into relative clauses: a woman who is proud of being a midwife), but it is wrong to say *a proud of being a midwife woman. Exceptions include very brief and often established phrases such as easy-to-use. (Certain complements can be moved to after the noun, leaving the adjective before the noun, as in a better man than you, a hard nut to crack.)\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain attributive adjective phrases are formed from other parts of speech, without any adjective as their head, as in a two-bedroom house, a no-jeans policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdverbs perform a wide range of functions. They typically modify verbs (or verb phrases), adjectives (or adjectival phrases), or other adverbs (or adverbial phrases).[24] However, adverbs also sometimes qualify noun phrases (only the boss; quite a lovely place), pronouns and determiners (almost all), prepositional phrases (halfway through the movie), or whole sentences, to provide contextual comment or indicate an attitude (Frankly, I don't believe you).[25] They can also indicate a relationship between clauses or sentences (He died, and consequently I inherited the estate).[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany English adverbs are formed from adjectives by adding the ending -ly, as in hopefully, widely, theoretically (for details of spelling and etymology, see -ly). Certain words can be used as both adjectives and adverbs, such as fast, straight, and hard; these are flat adverbs.  In earlier usage more flat adverbs were accepted in formal usage; many of these survive in idioms and colloquially. (That's just plain ugly.)  Some adjectives can also be used as flat adverbs when they actually describe the subject. (The streaker ran naked, not **The streaker ran nakedly.)  The adverb corresponding to the adjective good is well (note that bad forms the regular badly, although ill is occasionally used in some phrases).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also many adverbs that are not derived from adjectives,[24] including adverbs of time, of frequency, of place,  of degree and with other meanings. Some suffixes that are commonly used to form adverbs from nouns are -ward[s] (as in homeward[s]) and -wise (as in lengthwise).\\r\\n\\r\\nMost adverbs form comparatives and superlatives by modification with more and most: often, more often, most often; smoothly, more smoothly, most smoothly (see also comparison of adjectives, above). However, a few adverbs retain irregular inflection for comparative and superlative forms:[24] much, more, most; a little, less, least; well, better, best; badly, worse, worst; far, further (farther), furthest (farthest); or follow the regular adjectival inflection: fast, faster, fastest; soon, sooner, soonest; etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdverbs indicating the manner of an action are generally placed after the verb and its objects (We considered the proposal carefully), although other positions are often possible (We carefully considered the proposal). Many adverbs of frequency, degree, certainty, etc. (such as often, always, almost, probably, and various others such as just) tend to be placed before the verb (they usually have chips), although if there is an auxiliary or other \\"special verb\\" (see ?Verbs above), then the normal position for such adverbs is after that special verb (or after the first of them, if there is more than one): I have just finished the crossword; She can usually manage a pint; We are never late; You might possibly have been unconscious. Adverbs that provide a connection with previous information (such as next, then, however), and those that provide the context (such as time or place) for a sentence, are typically placed at the start of the sentence: Yesterday we went on a shopping expedition.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nA special type of adverb is the adverbial particle used to form phrasal verbs (such as up in pick up, on in get on, etc.) If such a verb also has an object, then the particle may precede or follow the object, although it will normally follow the object if the object is a pronoun (pick the pen up or pick up the pen, but pick it up).\\r\\n\\r\\nAn adverb phrase is a phrase that acts as an adverb within a sentence.[27] An adverb phrase may have an adverb as its head, together with any modifiers (other adverbs or adverb phrases) and complements, analogously to the adjective phrases described above. For example: very sleepily; all too suddenly; oddly enough; perhaps shockingly for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother very common type of adverb phrase is the prepositional phrase, which consists of a preposition and its object: in the pool; after two years; for the sake of harmony.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepositions form a closed word class,[25] although there are also certain phrases that serve as prepositions, such as in front of. A single preposition may have a variety of meanings, often including temporal, spatial and abstract. Many words that are prepositions can also serve as adverbs. Examples of common English prepositions (including phrasal instances) are of, in, on, over, under, to, from, with, in front of, behind, opposite, by, before, after, during, through, in spite of or despite, between, among, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nA preposition is usually used with a noun phrase as its complement. A preposition together with its complement is called a prepositional phrase.[28] Examples are in England, under the table, after six pleasant weeks, between the land and the sea. A prepositional phrase can be used as a complement or post-modifier of a noun in a noun phrase, as in the man in the car, the start of the fight; as a complement of a verb or adjective, as in deal with the problem, proud of oneself; or generally as an adverb phrase (see above).\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish allows the use of \\"stranded\\" prepositions. This can occur in interrogative and relative clauses, where the interrogative or relative pronoun that is the preposition's complement is moved to the start (fronted), leaving the preposition in place. This kind of structure is avoided in some kinds of formal English. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice that in the second example the relative pronoun that could be omitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nStranded prepositions can also arise in passive voice constructions and other uses of passive past participial phrases, where the complement in a prepositional phrase can become zero in the same way that a verb's direct object would: it was looked at; I will be operated on; get your teeth seen to. The same can happen in certain uses of infinitive phrases: he is nice to talk to; this is the page to make copies of.\\r\\n\\r\\nConjunctions express a variety of logical relations between items, phrases, clauses and sentences.[29] The principal coordinating conjunctions in English are and, or, and but, as well as nor, so, yet, and for. These can be used in many grammatical contexts to link two or more items of equal grammatical status,[29] for example:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also correlative conjunctions, where as well as the basic conjunction, an additional element appears before the first of the items being linked.[29] The common correlatives in English are:\\r\\n\\r\\nSubordinating conjunctions make relations between clauses, making the clause in which they appear into a subordinate clause.[31] Some common subordinating conjunctions in English are:\\r\\n\\r\\nA subordinating conjunction generally comes at the very start of its clause, although many of them can be preceded by qualifying adverbs, as in probably because ..., especially if .... The conjunction that can be omitted after certain verbs, as in she told us (that) she was ready. (For the use of that in relative clauses, see ?Relative pronouns above.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough English has largely lost its case system, personal pronouns still have three morphological cases that are simplified forms of the nominative, objective and genitive cases:[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost English personal pronouns have five forms: the nominative and oblique case forms, the possessive case, which has both a determiner form (such as my, our) and a distinct independent form (such as mine, ours) (with two exceptions: the third person singular masculine and the third person singular neuter it, which use the same form for both determiner and independent [his car, it is his]), and a distinct reflexive or intensive form (such as myself, ourselves). The interrogative personal pronoun who exhibits the greatest diversity of forms within the modern English pronoun system, having definite nominative, oblique, and genitive forms (who, whom, whose) and equivalently coordinating indefinite forms (whoever, whomever, and whosever).\\r\\n\\r\\nForms such as I, he and we are used for the subject (\\"I kicked the ball\\"), whereas forms such as me, him and us are used for the object (\\"John kicked me\\").[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nNouns have distinct singular and plural forms; that is, they decline to reflect their grammatical number; consider the difference between book and books. In addition, a few English pronouns have distinct nominative (also called subjective) and oblique (or objective) forms; that is, they decline to reflect their relationship to a verb or preposition, or case. Consider the difference between he (subjective) and him (objective), as in \\"He saw it\\" and \\"It saw him\\"; similarly, consider who, which is subjective, and the objective whom.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, these pronouns and a few others have distinct possessive forms, such as his and whose. By contrast, nouns have no distinct nominative and objective forms, the two being merged into a single plain case. For example, chair does not change form between \\"the chair is here\\" (subject) and \\"I saw the chair\\" (direct object). Possession is shown by the clitic -'s attached to a possessive noun phrase, rather than by declension of the noun itself.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs noted above under ?Verbs, a finite indicative verb (or its clause) is negated by placing the word not after an auxiliary, modal or other \\"special\\" verb such as do, can or be. For example, the clause I go is negated with the appearance of the auxiliary do, as I do not go (see do-support). When the affirmative already uses auxiliary verbs (I am going), no other auxiliary verbs are added to negate the clause (I am not going). (Until the period of early Modern English, negation was effected without additional auxiliary verbs: I go not.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMost combinations of auxiliary verbs etc. with not have contracted forms: don't, can't, isn't, etc. (Also the uncontracted negated form of can is written as a single word cannot.) On inversion of subject and verb (such as in questions; see below), the subject may be placed after a contracted negated form: Should he not pay? or Shouldn't he pay?\\r\\n\\r\\nOther elements, such as noun phrases, adjectives, adverbs, infinitive and participial phrases, etc., can be negated by placing the word not before them: not the right answer, not interesting, not to enter, not noticing the train, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen other negating words such as never, nobody, etc. appear in a sentence, the negating not is omitted (unlike its equivalents in many languages): I saw nothing or I didn't see anything, but not (except in non-standard speech) *I didn't see nothing (see Double negative). Such negating words generally have corresponding negative polarity items (ever for never, anybody for nobody, etc.) which can appear in a negative context, but are not negative themselves (and can thus be used after a negation without giving rise to double negatives).\\r\\n\\r\\nA typical sentence contains one independent clause and possibly one or more dependent clauses, although it is also possible to link together sentences of this form into longer sentences, using coordinating conjunctions (see above). A clause typically contains a subject (a noun phrase) and a predicate (a verb phrase in the terminology used above; that is, a verb together with its objects and complements). A dependent clause also normally contains a subordinating conjunction (or in the case of relative clauses, a relative pronoun or phrase containing one).\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish word order has moved from the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being almost exclusively subjectÿverbÿobject (SVO). The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as he had hoped to try to open it. In most sentences English marks grammatical relations only through word order. The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The Objectÿsubjectÿverb (OSV) may on occasion be seen in English, usually in the future tense or used as a contrast with the conjunction \\"but\\", such as in the following examples: \\"Rome I shall see!\\", \\"I hate oranges, but apples I'll eat!\\".[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many other Western European languages, English historically allowed questions to be formed by inverting the positions of verb and subject. Modern English permits this only in the case of a small class of verbs (\\"special verbs\\"), consisting of auxiliaries as well as forms of the copula be (see subjectÿauxiliary inversion). To form a question from a sentence which does not have such an auxiliary or copula present, the auxiliary verb do (does, did) needs to be inserted, along with inversion of the word order, to form a question (see do-support). For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above concerns yes-no questions, but inversion also takes place in the same way after other questions, formed with interrogative words such as where, what, how, etc. An exception applies when the interrogative word is the subject or part of the subject, in which case there is no inversion. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that inversion does not apply in indirect questions: I wonder where he is (not *... where is he). Indirect yes-no questions can be expressed using if or whether as the interrogative word: Ask them whether/if they saw him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNegative questions are formed similarly; however if the verb undergoing inversion has a contraction with not, then it is possible to invert the subject with this contraction as a whole. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also English auxiliaries and contractions ?Contractions and inversion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe syntax of a dependent clause is generally the same as that of an independent clause, except that the dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun (or phrase containing such). In some situations (as already described) the conjunction or relative pronoun that can be omitted. Another type of dependent clause with no subordinating conjunction is the conditional clause formed by inversion (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clause structure with inverted subject and verb, used to form questions as described above, is also used in certain types of declarative sentence. This occurs mainly when the sentence begins with an adverbial or other phrase that is essentially negative or contains words such as only, hardly, etc.: Never have I known someone so stupid; Only in France can such food be tasted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn elliptical sentences (see below), inversion takes place after so (meaning \\"also\\") as well as after the negative neither: so do I, neither does she.\\r\\n\\r\\nInversion can also be used to form conditional clauses, beginning with should, were (subjunctive), or had, in the following ways:\\r\\n\\r\\nOther similar forms sometimes appear, but are less common. There is also a construction with subjunctive be, as in be he alive or dead (meaning \\"no matter whether he is alive or dead\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of inversion to express a third-person imperative is now mostly confined to the expression long live X, meaning \\"let X live long\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an imperative sentence (one giving an order), there is usually no subject in the independent clause: Go away until I call you. It is possible, however, to include you as the subject for emphasis: You stay away from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany types of elliptical construction are possible in English, resulting in sentences that omit certain redundant elements. Various examples are given in the article on Ellipsis.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome notable elliptical forms found in English include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first published English grammar was a Pamphlet for Grammar of 1586, written by William Bullokar with the stated goal of demonstrating that English was just as rule-based as Latin. Bullokar's grammar was faithfully modeled on William Lily's Latin grammar, Rudimenta Grammatices (1534), used in English schools at that time, having been \\"prescribed\\" for them in 1542 by Henry VIII. Bullokar wrote his grammar in English and used a \\"reformed spelling system\\" of his own invention; but many English grammars, for much of the century after Bullokar's effort, were written in Latin, especially by authors who were aiming to be scholarly. John Wallis's Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae (1685) was the last English grammar written in Latin.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as late as the early 19th century, Lindley Murray, the author of one of the most widely used grammars of the day, was having to cite \\"grammatical authorities\\" to bolster the claim that grammatical cases in English are different from those in Ancient Greek or Latin.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish parts of speech are based on Latin and Greek parts of speech.[36] Some English grammar rules were adopted from Latin, for example John Dryden is thought to have created the rule no sentences can end in a preposition because Latin cannot end sentences in prepositions. The rule of no split infinitives was adopted from Latin because Latin has no split infinitives.[37][38][39]","input":"How many parts of speech exist in english grammar?"},{"output":"July 2012","context":"Camilla Luddington (born December 15, 1983) is an English actress, known for her roles as Kate Middleton in the Lifetime TV film William & Kate: The Movie (2011) and as Jo Wilson in the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy.\\r\\nShe provided the voice and motion capture work for Lara Croft in the video game Tomb Raider (2013) and its sequel Rise of the Tomb Raider (2015).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuddington was born in Ascot, Berkshire, on 15 December 1983.

Seeds may be used to grow more cotton or to produce cottonseed oil.\\r\\nHandheld roller gins had been used in the Indian subcontinent since at earliest AD 500 and then in other regions.[2] The Indian worm-gear roller gin, invented some time around the sixteenth century,[3] has, according to Lakwete, remained virtually unchanged up to the present time. A modern mechanical cotton gin was created by American inventor Eli Whitney in 1793 and patented in 1794. Whitney's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through, while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States, but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased. The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War.[4] Modern automated cotton gins use multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws, and offer far higher productivity than their hand-powered precursors.[5]\\r\\nEli Whitney invented his cotton gin in 1793. He began to work on this project after moving to Georgia in search of work. Given that farmers were desperately searching for a way to make cotton farming profitable, a woman named Catharine Greene provided Whitney with funding to create the first cotton gin. Whitney created two cotton gins: a small one that could be hand cranked and a large one that could be driven by a horse or water power. Thanks to the cotton gin, the amount of raw cotton yielded doubled each decade after 1800.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ajanta caves of India yield evidence of a single-roller cotton gin in use by the 5th century. This cotton gin was used in India until innovations were made in the form of foot powered gins. The cotton gin was invented in India as a mechanical device known as a charkhi, more technically the \\"wooden-worm-worked roller\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nCotton fibers are produced in the seed pods (\\"bolls\\") of the cotton plant where the fibers (\\"lint\\") in the bolls are tightly interwoven with seeds. To make the fibers usable, the seeds and fibers must first be separated, a task which had been previously performed manually, with production of cotton requiring hours of labor for the separation. Many simple seed-removing devices had been invented, but until the innovation of the cotton gin, most required significant operator attention and worked only on a small scale.[7]\\r\\nThe earliest versions of the cotton gin, which were the size of a small printer, consisted of a single roller made of iron or wood and a flat piece of stone or wood. Evidence for this type of gin has been found in Africa, Asia, and North America. The first documentation of the cotton gin by contemporary scholars is found in the fifth century AD, in the form of Buddhist paintings depicting a single-roller gin in the Ajanta Caves in western India.[2] These early gins were difficult to use and required a great deal of skill. A narrow single roller was necessary to expel the seeds from the cotton without crushing the seeds. The design was similar to that of a mealing stone, which was used to grind grain. The early history of the cotton gin is ambiguous, because archeologists likely mistook the cotton gin's parts for other tools.[2]\\r\\nBetween the 12th and 14th centuries, dual-roller gins appeared in India and China. The Indian version of the dual-roller gin was prevalent throughout the Mediterranean cotton trade by the 16th century. This mechanical device was, in some areas, driven by water power.[8]\\r\\nThe worm gear roller gin, which was invented in the Indian subcontinent during the early Delhi Sultanate era of the 13thÿ14th centuries, came into use in the Mughal Empire some time around the 16th century,[9] and is still used in the Indian subcontinent through to the present day.[2] Another innovation, the incorporation of the crank handle in the cotton gin, first appeared some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire.[10] The incorporation of the worm gear and crank handle into the roller cotton gin led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production during the Mughal era.[11]\\r\\nIt was reported that, with an Indian cotton gin, which is half machine and half tool, one man and one woman could clean 28 pounds of cotton per day. With a modified Forbes version, one man and a boy could produce 250 pounds per day. If oxen were used to power 16 of these machines, and a few people's labour was used to feed them, they could produce as much work as 750 people did formerly.[12]\\r\\nThe Indian roller cotton gin, known as the churka or charkha, was introduced to the United States in the mid-18th century, when it was adopted in the southern United States. The device was adopted for cleaning long-staple cotton, but was not suitable for the short-staple cotton that was more common in certain states such as Georgia. Several modifications were made to the Indian roller gin by Mr. Krebs in 1772 and Joseph Eve in 1788, but their uses remained limited to the long-staple variety, up until Eli Whitney's development of a short-staple cotton gin in 1793.[13]\\r\\nEli Whitney (1765ÿ1825) applied for a patent of his cotton gin on October 28, 1793; the patent was granted on March 14, 1794, but was not validated until 1807. Whitney's patent was assigned patent number 72X.[14] There is slight controversy over whether the idea of the modern cotton gin and its constituent elements are correctly attributed to Eli Whitney. The popular image of Whitney inventing the cotton gin is attributed to an article on the subject written in the early 1870s and later reprinted in 1910 in The Library of Southern Literature. In this article, the author claimed Catharine Littlefield Greene suggested to Whitney the use of a brush-like component instrumental in separating out the seeds and cotton. To date, Greene's role in the invention of the gin has not been verified independently.[15]\\r\\nWhitney's cotton gin model was capable of cleaning 50 pounds (23?kg) of lint per day. The model consisted of a wooden cylinder surrounded by rows of slender spikes, which pulled the lint through the bars of a comb-like grid.[16] The grids were closely spaced, preventing the seeds from passing through. Loose cotton was brushed off, preventing the mechanism from jamming.\\r\\nMany contemporary inventors attempted to develop a design that would process short staple cotton, and Hodgen Holmes, Robert Watkins, William Longstreet, and John Murray had all been issued patents for improvements to the cotton gin by 1796.[17] However, the evidence indicates Whitney did invent the saw gin, for which he is famous. Although he spent many years in court attempting to enforce his patent against planters who made unauthorized copies, a change in patent law ultimately made his claim legally enforceable ÿ too late for him to make much money from the device in the single year remaining before the patent expired.[18]\\r\\nWhile Whitney's gin facilitated the cleaning of seeds from short-staple cotton, it damaged the fibers of (extra-long staple) cotton (Gossypium barbadense). In 1840 Fones McCarthy received a patent for a \\"Smooth Cylinder Cotton-gin\\", a roller gin. McCarthy's gin was marketed for use with both short-staple and extra-long staple cotton, but was particularly useful for processing long-staple cotton. After McCarthy's patent expired in 1861, McCarthy type gins were manufactured in Britain and sold around the world.[19] McCarthy's gin was adopted for cleaning the Sea Island variety of extra-long staple cotton grown in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. It cleaned cotton several times faster than the older gins, and, when powered by one horse, produced 150 to 200 pounds of lint a day.[20] The McCarthy gin used a reciprocating knife to detach seed from the lint. Vibration caused by the reciprocating motion limited the speed at which the gin could operate. In the middle of the 20th Century gins using a rotating blade replaced ones using a reciprocating blade. These descendants of the McCarthy gin are the only gins now used for extra-long staple cotton in the United States.[21]\\r\\nPrior to the introduction of the mechanical cotton gin, cotton had required considerable labor to clean and separate the fibers from the seeds.[22] With Eli Whitneys gin, cotton became a tremendously profitable business, creating many fortunes in the Antebellum South. Cities such as New Orleans, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; Charleston, South Carolina; and Galveston, Texas became major shipping ports, deriving substantial economic benefit from cotton raised throughout the South. Additionally, the greatly expanded supply of cotton created strong demand for textile machinery and improved machine designs that replaced wooden parts with metal. This led to the invention of many machine tools in the early 19th century.[1]\\r\\nThe invention of the cotton gin caused massive growth in the production of cotton in the United States, concentrated mostly in the South. Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850. As a result, the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery, with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy.[23] While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds, a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day.[24] The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production, increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850.[25] By 1860, black slave labor from the American South was providing two-thirds of the worlds supply of cotton, and up to 80% of the crucial British market.[26] The cotton gin thus transformed cotton as a crop and the American South into the globe's first agricultural powerhouse\\".[27]\\r\\nBecause of its inadvertent effect on American slavery, and on its ensuring that the South's economy developed in the direction of plantation-based agriculture (while encouraging the growth of the textile industry elsewhere, such as in the North), the invention of the cotton gin is frequently cited as one of the indirect causes of the American Civil War.[4][28][29]\\r\\nIn modern cotton production, cotton arrives at industrial cotton gins either in trailers, in compressed rectangular \\"modules\\" weighing up to 10 metric tons each or in polyethylene wrapped round modules similar to a bale of hay produced during the picking process by the most recent generation of cotton pickers. Cotton arriving at the gin is sucked in via a pipe, approximately 16 inches (41?cm) in diameter, that is swung over the cotton. This pipe is usually manually operated, but is increasingly automated in modern cotton plants. The need for trailers to haul the product to the gin has been drastically reduced since the introduction of modules. If the cotton is shipped in modules, the module feeder breaks the modules apart using spiked rollers and extracts the largest pieces of foreign material from the cotton. The module feeder's loose cotton is then sucked into the same starting point as the trailer cotton.\\r\\nThe cotton then enters a dryer, which removes excess moisture.The cylinder cleaner uses six or seven rotating, spiked cylinders to break up large clumps of cotton. Finer foreign material, such as soil and leaves, passes through rods or screens for removal. The stick machine uses centrifugal force to remove larger foreign matter, such as sticks and burrs, while the cotton is held by rapidly rotating saw cylinders.\\r\\nThe gin stand uses the teeth of rotating saws to pull the cotton through a series of \\"ginning ribs\\", which pull the fibers from the seeds which are too large to pass through the ribs. The cleaned seed is then removed from the gin via an auger conveyor system. The seed is reused for planting or is sent to an oil mill to be further processed into cottonseed oil and cottonseed meal. The lint cleaners again use saws and grid bars, this time to separate immature seeds and any remaining foreign matter from the fibers. The bale press then compresses the cotton into bales for storage and shipping. Modern gins can process up to 15 tonnes (33,000?lb) of cotton per hour.\\r\\nModern cotton gins create a substantial amount of cotton gin residue (CGR) consisting of sticks, leaves, dirt, immature bolls, and cottonseed. Research is currently under way to investigate the use of this waste in producing ethanol. Due to fluctuations in the chemical composition in processing, there is difficulty in creating a consistent ethanol process, but there is potential to further maximize the utilization of waste in the cotton production.[30][5]","input":"How much of the world's supply of cotton came from the south?"},{"output":"Srat al-Fti?ah","context":"Arabic text { English translation\\r\\nSrat al-Fti?ah (Arabic: ???????? ?????????????) is the first chapter (surah) of the Quran. Its seven verses (ayat) are a prayer for the guidance, lordship and mercy of God.[1] This chapter has an essential role in Islamic prayer (salt). The primary literal meaning of the expression \\"al-Fti?ah\\" is \\"The Opener,\\" which could refer to this Surah being \\"the opener of the Book\\" (Fti?at al-kitb), to its being the first Surah recited in full in every prayer cycle (rak?ah), or to the manner in which it serves as an opening for many functions in everyday Islamic life. Some Muslims interpret it as a reference to an implied ability of the Surah to open a person to faith in God.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name al-Fti?ah (\\"the Opener\\") is due to the subject-matter of the Surah. Fti?ah is that which opens a subject or a book or any other thing. In other words, a sort of preface.[1]\\r\\nIt is also called, Umm Al-Kitab (\\"the Mother of the Book\\") and Umm Al-Quran (\\"the Mother of the Quran\\");[4][5] Sab'a al Mathani (\\"Seven repeated [verses]\\", an appellation taken from verse 15:87 of the Quran);[5] Al-Hamd (\\"praise\\"), because a hadith narrates Muhammad as having said: \\"The prayer [al-Fti?ah] is divided into two halves between Me and My servants. When the servant says, 'All praise is due to God', the Lord of existence, God says, 'My servant has praised Me'.\\";[6] Al-Shifa' (\\"the Cure\\"), because a hadith narrates Muhammad as having said: \\"The Opening of the Book is a cure for every poison.\\";[7][8][non-primary source needed], Al-Ruqyah (\\"remedy\\" or \\"spiritual cure\\").,[5] and al-Asas, \\"The Foundation\\", referring to its serving as a foundation for the entire Quran [9]\\r\\nAccording to Abd Allah ibn Abbas and others, al-Fti?ah is a Meccan sura; while according to others it is a Medinan sura. The former view is more widely accepted, although some believe that it was revealed in both Mekka and Medina.[10][11] In the Quran, the first revelations to Muhammad were only the first few verses (ayats) of Surahs Alaq, Muzzammil, Al-Muddathir, etc. Most narrators recorded that al-Fti?ah was the first complete Surah revealed to Muhammad.[1]\\r\\nAl-Fti?ah is often believed to be a synthesis of the Quran.[12] It in itself is a prayer at the very beginning of the Quran, which acts as a preface of the Quran and implies that the book is for a person who is a seeker of trutha reader who is asking a deity who is the only one worthy of all praise (and is the creator, owner, sustainer of the worlds etc.) to guide him to a straight path.[1] It can be said to \\"encapsulate all of the metaphysical and eschatological realities of which human beings must remain conscious.\\" [13]\\r\\nThere are differing interpretations for verses 6 and 7. The phrase \\"the Path journeyed by those upon whom You showered blessings\\" is usually seen as referring to Muslims. The phrase \\"those who made themselves liable to criminal cognizance/arrest\\" (more clearly translated as \\"those who have incurred Your wrath\\") is usually seen as referring to the Jews and the phrase \\"those who are the neglectful wanderers\\" (more clearly translated as \\"those who have gone astray\\") is seen as referring to the Christians.[14] The Quran: An Encyclopedia, authored by 43 Muslim and non-Muslim academics says, \\"The Prophet interpreted those who incurred Gods wrath as the Jews and the misguided as the Christians\\".[15]\\r\\nAustralian pastor in linguistics and theology Mark Durie says,\\r\\nTo be genuine and effective, reconciliation between Muslims and those they refer to as 'People of the Book' (Jews and Christians), requires that Al-Fatihah and its meaning be discussed openly. That devout Muslims are daily declaring before Allah that Christians have gone astray and Jews are objects of divine wrath, must be considered a matter of central importance for interfaith relations. This is all the more so because the interpretation of verse 7 which relates it to Christians and Jews is soundly based upon the words of Muhammad himself. As Al-Fatihah is the daily worship of Muslims, and represents the very essence of Islam itself, the meaning of these words cannot be ignored or glossed over.[16]\\r\\nOther commentators[who?] suggest that these verses do not refer to any particular religious community.[14]\\r\\nAt the interfaith prayer service for the inauguration of President Donald Trump, Sajid Tarar, from the Medina Masjid, Baltimore, Maryland, recited the Surah Fatiha.[17] Andrew Bostom said because of the contentious aspects of this Surah its use on State occasions such as this should be reconsidered as a, \\"basic principle of true ecumenism, and basic civility\\".[18]\\r\\nIn his hadith collection Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ahmad ibn Hanbal recorded that Abu Sa\`id bin Al-Mu\`alla had said:\\r\\n\\"I was praying when the Prophet called me, so I did not answer him until I finished the prayer. I then went to him and he said, What prevented you from coming?\\r\\nI said, 'O Messenger of Allah! I was praying.'\\r\\nHe said, Didn't Allah say,\\r\\nO you who believe! Answer Allah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life.\\r\\nHe then said,\\r\\n\\"I will teach you the greatest Surah in the Qur'an before you leave the Masjid (Mosque).\\"\\r\\nHe held my hand and when he was about to leave the Masjid, I said, \`O Messenger of Allah! You said: I will teach you the greatest Surah in the Qur'an.'\\r\\nHe said, Yes.\\r\\nAl-Hamdu lillahi Rabbil-\`Alamin,\\r\\nIt is the seven repeated (verses) and the Glorious Qur'an that I was given.\\r\\nMuhammad al-Bukhari, Abu Dawood, Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah also recorded this hadith.[19]\\r\\nOne hadith narrates a story of a companion of Muhammad who recited al-Fti?ah as a remedy for a tribal chief who was poisoned. According to the hadith, Muhammad later asked the companion, \\"How did you know that it is a Ruqqayah [remedy]?\\"[5] Muhammad al-Bukhari recorded in his collection:\\r\\nNarrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:\\r\\nWhile we were on one of our journeys, we dismounted at a place where a slave girl came and said, \\"The chief of this tribe has been stung by a scorpion and our men are not present; is there anybody among you who can treat him (by reciting something)?\\" Then one of our men went along with her though we did not think that he knew any such treatment. But he treated the chief by reciting something, and the sick man recovered whereupon he gave him thirty sheep and gave us milk to drink (as a reward). When he returned, we asked our friend, \\"Did you know how to treat with the recitation of something?\\" He said, \\"No, but I treated him only with the recitation of the Mother of the Book [al-Fti?ah].\\" We said, \\"Do not say anything (about it) till we reach or ask the Prophet. So when we reached Medina, we mentioned that to the Prophet (in order to know whether the sheep which we had taken were lawful to take or not). The Prophet said, \\"How did he come to know that it [al-Fti?ah] could be used for treatment? Distribute your reward and assign for me one share thereof as well.\\"\\r\\nSimilar versions are found in: Al-Bukhari: 007.071.645[21]medicine; Al-Bukhari: 007.071.633[22]medicine; Al-Bukhari: 007.071.632[23]medicine\\r\\nMuslim ibn al-Hajjaj recorded that Abu Hurairah had told that Muhammad had said:\\r\\nIf anyone observes prayer in which he does not recite Umm al-Qur'an,[24] it is deficient [he said this three times] and not complete.\\r\\nA similar story is found in Al-Bukhari: 001.012.723[26]characteristics of prayer.\\r\\nMuslim ibn al-Hajjaj recorded:\\r\\nIbn 'Abbas reported that while Gabriel was sitting with the Apostle (may peace be upon him) he heard a creaking sound above him.

It was conceived that a state supported college located in the center of the state at Columbia, South Carolina would foster friendships between those of both regions thus allowing the state to present a united front to the nation when threatened with issues jeopardizing the South Carolina way of life.  The University of South Carolina's history can be described in four distinct phases:  a firebrand college (1801ÿ1862), constant reorganization (1865ÿ1891), college to university (1891ÿ1944) and the state's university (1944ÿpresent).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University was founded as South Carolina College on December 19, 1801 by an act of the General Assembly after Governor John Drayton pushed for its foundation on November 23, 1801.  The establishment of a publicly funded college at the capital was intended to unite and promote harmony between the Lowcountry and the Backcountry.  On January 10, 1805, having an initial enrollment of nine students, the college commenced classes with a traditional classical curriculum. Jonathan Maxcy was its first president and served until his death in 1820.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the generous support of the General Assembly, South Carolina College acquired a reputation as the leading institution of the South and attracted several noteworthy scholars, including Francis Lieber, Thomas Cooper, and Joseph LeConte.  However, the college suffered greatly and lost most of its prestige when it closed during the American Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe students formed a cadet company in December 1860 to aid the Southern cause, but an order by Governor Pickens prevented them from leaving Columbia.  Undeterred, the students disbanded their company on April 12 and formed a new company while en route to Charleston so that the governor's previous holding orders would be invalid.  Once in Charleston, General Beauregard assigned the company to guard Sullivan's Island, much to the dismay of the students who greatly desired to be a part of the Battle of Fort Sumter.  After three weeks of guard duty, the student cadet company returned to Columbia to a hero's welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in June 1861, the students reformed the company and requested to be accepted for service.  Governor Pickens accepted their request provided that the faculty also approved the venture, but the faculty did not give its consent because they did not want the college to needlessly be closed.  The frustrated students even went as far as negotiating service of their unit with President Jefferson Davis, who agreed, but again Governor Pickens denied their use because the faculty was not willing to let them go.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the students returned in October, they reorganized their military unit as the \\"third company.\\"  The Union attack of the South Carolina coast in November at the Battle of Port Royal led Governor Pickens to agree to their request to be mustered for active duty, but President Longstreet and the faculty steadfastly maintained their opposition to the students leaving for service.  However, with the support of the governor the students ignored the protests of the faculty and departed for the Lowcountry.  Governor Pickens kept the student company in Charleston to serve as his bodyguard and because the Union forces at Port Royal did not press their advantage, he released the students from military service on December 10.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventy-two students were present for classes in January 1862 and the college functioned as best it could until a call by the Confederate government for South Carolina to fill its quota of 18,000 soldiers.  A system of conscription would begin on March 20 for all men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, so on March 8 all of the students at the college volunteered for service in order to avoid the dishonor of having been conscripted.  Despite the depletion of students, the professors issued a notice that the college would temporarily close and would reopen to those under eighteen.  When the college reopened on March 17, only nine students showed up for classes and it became quite apparent to all that the college would not last past the end of the term in June.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 25 with the consent of the state government, the Confederate authorities took possession of the college buildings and converted them into a hospital.  After many unsuccessful attempts to reopen the college, the trustees passed a resolution on December 2, 1863 that officially closed the college.  By February 1865, Sherman's army had reached the outskirts of Columbia and the college was spared from destruction by the Union forces because of its use as a hospital.  In addition, a company of the 25th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment was stationed at the campus on February 17 to protect it from harm and to thwart off pillaging Yankee soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union army took possession of the college on May 24, 1865 and although the future for the college under military control, General John Porter Hatch sent a letter on June 19 to the remaining professors at the college that it should reopen as soon as possible.  The appointment of Benjamin Franklin Perry as provisional governor of South Carolina on June 30 by President Andrew Johnson restored civilian rule to the state.  Perry reinstated the trustees to their positions and the board met on September 20 to authorize the college to reopen on the first Monday of January in 1866.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a message to the legislature in October, Perry sought to convert the college into a university because with the state in an impoverished situation, it would provide a more practical education.  The model that he wished to follow was the elective system used by the University of Virginia.  Perry was succeeded in November as governor by James Lawrence Orr, a graduate of the University of Virginia, who also wished to see the college adopt the curriculum of his alma mater.  Little opposition developed to change the College into a university and bill to establish the University of South Carolina was passed by the General Assembly on December 19, 1865, sixty-four years after the institution's foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schools of the university remained largely the same as they were in the College, with the addition of a school of engineering and mathematics.  For the students, the difference was great because they were given much more freedom than afforded in the College, and they were given the ability to choose their classes rather than having to submit to a compulsory curriculum identical for all.  Perry and Orr believed that the relaxed atmosphere at the University would allow it to prosper and reach three or four hundred students in a few years.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reopening of the University was pushed back to January 10 due to the dilapidated condition of the buildings on the campus and to celebrate the anniversary of the original opening of South Carolina College.  Fewer than fifty students attended in the first term, which alarmed Governor Orr.  He recommended to the General Assembly that schools of law and medicine be added, which the legislature established in 1866.  Despite this step, the University faced an ominous future as the state was beginning to undergo Reconstruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Radical Republicans gained control of the state government in 1868, they sought to integrate the University; the constitution of 1868 had stated that all universities of the state should be \\"free and open to all the children and youths of the State, without regard to race and color.\\"[2]  Former Governor Orr urged the legislature to preserve the University as an institution for the whites and to convert the dormant campus of The Citadel into a college for the blacks.  Governor Robert Kingston Scott ignored this request and recommended that the legislature bring the University into compliance with the Morrill Act to make it qualify as a land grant college and accept federal aid; it had to remove race as an admissions criteria.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University Act of 1869 reorganized the University and provided it with generous state financial support.  An amendment was added to the act by W. J. Whipper, a black representative from Beaufort, to prevent racial discrimination from the admissions policy of the University.  The legislature elected two black trustees to the governing board of the University on March 9, 1869.  Franklin J. Moses, Jr., state representative and speaker of the house, also supported admission of all races to the state school. In October 1873, Henry E. Hayne, the Republican secretary of state, was admitted as the first black student; he was of mostly white ancestry with a white politician father.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe admission of black students to the University was inevitable, and three factors contributed to this. First, the University never achieved a level of enrollment that was commensurate with its financial backing by the legislature.  Enrollment never exceeded one hundred students, whereas the enrollment at Wofford College exceeded that mark in 1870.  White students were believed to avoid the university from fear it would be integrated.[citation needed]  The second reason was the failure of the state to provide an adequate public university for the education of blacks. It was trying to compensate rapidly for the state's failure to educate blacks in the antebellum years. In 1872, funds were allocated for the Agricultural and Mechanical Institute at Orangeburg, but they were badly mismanaged. Black legislators called for the opening of the University to black students. Finally, the state Republican party split for the election of 1872 between Radical and moderate factions.  The Radicals won and pressed their advantage by electing four blacks to the Board of Trustees, thus constituting a majority.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legislature established a normal school to train teachers for the lower grades on the campus of the University as well as a preparatory school, since most black students of the state had been deprived of strong academic training in years past. In addition, to encourage enrollment by blacks, tuition and other fees were abolished.  On October 7, 1873, Henry E. Hayne, the Secretary of State of South Carolina, became the first black student when he registered for the fall session in the medical college of the University.[3][4]  As a result of his enrollment, three professors resigned, and some white students left.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 8, enrollment stood at eight students, seven of whom were the sons of professors.  The number increased to twenty-two students after many politicians registered with the University to show that it was open for both races, yet few of the politicians attended classes.  Troubled by the low enrollment, State Treasurer of South Carolina, Francis L. Cardozo went to Washington and persuaded a handful of students at Howard University to transfer to the University.  Drastic measures were required to increase the number of students and the legislature passed an act in February 1874 to provide for 124 scholarships of $200.  The conservative press denounced this move because with the absence of tuition, it meant that students were effectively being paid to attend the University, but poor students were often critical to family support, and scholarships helped them cover living expenses.[5]  Many of the scholarship students could not meet the entrance requirements into the freshman class, so the faculty assembled them into a sub-freshman class. This plan was abolished in 1875 as the legislature had not authorized it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scholarships achieved their desired effect in increasing enrollment and by 1875, 90% of the student body was black.[6]  The University of South Carolina holds the distinction of being the only state university in the South to admit and grant degrees to black students during Reconstruction.  When the Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1876, they quickly acted to end admission of blacks, closing the University on June 7, 1877 by a joint resolution of the General Assembly. They passed legislation authorizing only white students and setting up Claflin College as the state institution for black students.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was far from certain that the University would be reopened and debate ensued in the General Assembly over the necessity of the University.  Many legislators, led by Martin Witherspoon Gary, felt that the state had other obligations and it was not practical for the state to spend money on the University.  In addition, these legislators were from the Upstate and had no attachment to the University. They were not part of the planter elite and had attended other schools.  An act to reorganize the University was passed by the state Senate by two votes on March 2, 1878, but it did not provide for the appropriation of funds to the reopening.  The act specified that the University was to consist of two branches, one styled as the South Carolina College in Columbia for the whites and Claflin College in Orangeburg for the blacks.  In order to mollify agitation by the farming interests, a section of the act specified that an agricultural department was to be established with the University.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 5, 1880 the institution was reopened as the South Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts and largely derived its funding from the Morrill Act.  Despite its name as an agriculture and mechanical college, few students showed an interest in either area.  Only nine students worked the 20-acre (81,000?m2) college farm for the first session and just twenty-one attended the mechanical shop.  Because the state could not afford a liberal arts University, it took advantage of the Morrill Act in order to acquire federal funds, and offered some agriculture program to satisfy its requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1881, the state's financial situation was markedly improved and Governor Johnson Hagood called for greater expenditures on higher education.  With a much higher appropriation, the trustees abolished the farming and mechanical foreman positions, in 1882 restoring the institution to its antebellum status as the South Carolina College.  An agriculture department remained, but little of the curriculum was agricultural, and it was essentially identical to the general science program. The department suffered from neglect because its professor, John McLauren McBryde, was also the President of the institution and in that position he focused most of his energies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the latter years of the 1880s, the College increasingly came under attack from religious groups and agricultural interests.  The denominational colleges, struggling to rebuild from the Civil War, demanded that free tuition be ended at the college, and the General Assembly capitulated in 1887 by fixing tuition rates at $40 per year.  Led by Ben Tillman [who owned 400 acres as a planter, cultivated by tenant farmers], the agrarians pushed to establish a separate agriculture college because they believed that the College was not providing an adequate education in agriculture.  Despite Tillman's rhetoric, a majority of the students were sons of farmers. At that time, the most advanced agricultural research was being conducted at Cornell and the University of California, both liberal arts colleges.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo take advantage of the Hatch Act and to assuage the concerns of the farmers, the legislature passed an act in 1887 to reorganize the college as the University of South Carolina with six schools and colleges.  An agricultural experiment station was set up, the college farm was expanded by 100 acres (0.40?km2), and a well-developed agriculture program was initiated.  The University was so successful that Ben Tillman announced his retirement from public life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Green Clemson bequeathed his estate in 1888 to establish and endow a separate agriculture college in the state. Tillman reemerged to carry the cause to the legislature and in 1889, Governor Richardson signed the bill accepting the bequest.  The Morrill and Hatch funds were transferred to the new agriculture college in June 1890, and the University's agricultural department was closed. The vitality of the University was threatened during the 1890 campaign when Ben Tillman advocated its closing.  Although he won the election for governor, he completed reorganization of the university as a liberal arts college during his term.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University was reorganized as the South Carolina College in 1891, and it struggled to attract students through the rest of the decade.  It was restricted to teaching the subjects of law, literature, classics, and theoretical science.[9]  The prestige of the College had fallen such that in 1893, a proposal was offered in the legislature to close the campus and provide homes for Confederate veterans on it instead.[10]  With enrollment lagging and the state lacking a liberal arts school for women, the legislature passed a bill in 1893 that mandated the College to admit women.  On September 24, 1895, Frances Guignard Gibbes was the first woman to be admitted to the College, and in 1898 Mattie Jean Adams was the first to graduate.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Tillman had crippled the institution when he became governor, he did not let it die.  The number of students steadily declined from a high of 235 in 1889 to a low of 68 in 1894; but despite the urging of legislators to close it, Tillman ensured through his governorship that the College received an adequate level of funding.  Tillman re-established the normal school at the College, long dormant since the end of Reconstruction.  In addition, the legislature authorized adding engineering to the College in 1894 despite a previous prohibition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe victory by Duncan Clinch Heyward in the gubernatorial election of 1902 marked the end of Tillmanism and the return of support by the governor's office for the institution.  Heyward pushed the legislature to convert the College into a University in 1905 to mark the centennial by providing the state with a capstone for its educational system.  The effort failed when legislators feared that The Citadel was to be absorbed into the University, but the measure was reintroduced in 1906 and passed on February 17 to charter the institution for the last time as the University of South Carolina.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next forty years, the institution struggled to find its identity as it cycled through periods of achieving popularity versus academic excellence.  Under the vigorous leadership of President Samuel Chiles Mitchell from 1909 to 1913, enrollment at the University doubled; he brought the University to the state by setting up extension courses in 1910.  Incessant criticism by Governor Coleman Livingston Blease over Mitchell's handling of University affairs led to his resignation and the trustees elected William Spenser Currell with the intention of raising the level of scholarship at the University.  Entrance requirements were made more stringent and Currell's efforts were rewarded when in 1917 the University became the first state-supported college or university in South Carolina to earn accreditation by the Southern Association.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entrance of America into World War I was enthusiastically supported by the student body, and the vast majority participated in the ROTC unit at the University.  To compensate for the loss of enrollment because of conscription, the war department replaced the ROTC program with the Student Army Training Corps.  After the war, the SATC was disbanded and military training was made compulsory for freshman and sophomore students in the ROTC program.  The ROTC program was scrapped in 1921 due to lack of interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aura of stagnation existed at the University in the early 1920s and the trustees elected William Davis Melton in 1922 to revive its fortunes.  Melton launched a campaign to popularize the institution by convincing the people of the state that it was not exclusively for the elite or a special interest group, but rather for the masses.  He gained a major increase in the appropriation by the legislature for the University, and in 1924 student enrollment surpassed that of Clemson for the first time.  Following Melton's death in 1926, Davison McDowell Douglas was elected President to consolidate the gains and tighten academic standards.  The board of trustees called upon James Rion McKissick in 1936 to return to Melton's policies of popularizing the University.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcKissick established the University News Service to combat perceived misconceptions of the University and to promote the high moral character of the students.  Due in large part to his efforts, enrollment reached record numbers and the University entered the 1940s with a renewed sense of optimism.  Yet, the world soon became engulfed by World War II. To help with the loss of enrollment because of mobilization, the University received a Naval ROTC detachment.  The University was quickly transformed into a Naval school when the Navy set up a V-5 Navy Flight Preparatory School, a Civil Aeronautics Administration-War Training Service program, and a V-12 Navy College Training Program.  The V-12 program was the most important to the University because the trainees were enrolled in classes; they became active participants in student life and extracurricular activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy November 1944 it was clear that World War II would soon be coming to a close and the servicemen would return to enroll in the university in massive numbers due in large part because of the passage of the G.I. Bill.  Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives and trustee of the University Solomon Blatt unveiled a proposal called the \\"new and greater university\\" plan that would move the university from its present site to a 1,200-acre (4.9?km2) site just outside Columbia. At the time, the university was the smallest state university in the South and a larger campus would more easily allow for expansion at much less cost. The idea of a move came from that of the relocation of Louisiana State University in 1925 and it was envisioned that a new campus would provide the impetus for the University of South Carolina \\"to establish itself as a great American state university.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlatt obtained support from all the key players in the politics of South Carolina to facilitate the proposal: Governor Olin D. Johnston, Governor-elect Ransome Judson Williams, Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Edgar Allan Brown, and Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Morris Tuten.  The Board of Trustees approved the plan in December 1944 by a vote of 17ÿ2, although complaints were issued from the dissenting voters that the decision was made with too much haste and without any input from the public.  In addition, Blatt chose Navy Rear Admiral Norman Murray Smith as the President of the University in large part because he held connections in the political establishments of South Carolina and the federal government necessary to secure funds for the relocation of the university.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Blatt's proposal caused an intense uproar[clarification needed] in the state because alumni and students felt that it would needlessly sever the university from its antebellum tradition.[citation needed] Other complaints arose that the process itself did not allow for public input and it was detested as a product of the Barnwell Ring.  Even with the outpouring of condemnation, municipalities lobbied to have the University moved to their locale such as Camden, Cheraw, Georgetown, Manning, Spartanburg, Sumter, Kershaw County and Oconee County.[14]  Blatt realized that his proposal in February 1945 would not receive the necessary support in the legislature and he modified it so that the University would expand upon its existing area.  This idea was warmly received by the alumni and students, but it died in the Finance Committee after Senator Edgar Brown declined to take up the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter World War II, enrollment at the University swelled from the influx of veterans.  They were wholeheartedly welcomed by President Smith who actively campaigned for their attendance and he announced that every qualified veteran would be admitted to the University.  The vast majority of South Carolina veterans chose to attend the University because of its hospitable atmosphere, but also for other reasons.  They did not want to attend Clemson or The Citadel because \\"the prospect of returning home to attend a military college was distasteful for the older men leaving the military after fighting the largest war in world history.\\"[15]  In addition, Clemson's rural location and its self-imposed restriction on the number of students made it inaccessible for a large number of veterans.  The University offered several special programs to meet the needs of the veterans and it continued an accelerated calendar until 1949.  It was at this point in history that the two universities switched reputations and missions.  Carolina became known as the university for the common man and an institution accessible for all whereas Clemson settled into a status of elitism.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Smith faced increasing criticism through his tenure because he failed to articulate a clear policy for the University's future and he did not campaign for the legislature to appropriate enough funds for its needs.[citation needed] As president of a public university, Smith's chief responsibility was to be its publicist and develop ties with the political power of the state.  Instead, Sol Blatt grew tired of having to carry the burden for the University in the legislature and Governor Thurmond felt that he received an icy reception from the administration.  In 1952, Smith resigned and the protg of Governor Byrnes, Donald S. Russell, was elected President by the Board of Trustees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ascendancy of Russell was crucial for the University at a critical moment in its history because he brought youth and dynamic leadership to the Presidency.  His vision for the University was for it to be the capstone of the state's higher education system and for it to be the senior partner to the other state colleges.  Russell's first step toward building a great university was the strengthening of the faculty by bringing in nationally known professors.  Secondly, he improved the academics at the University through the expansion of courses, the revamping of programs and the introduction of entrance examinations.  A report conducted by MIT to overhaul the engineering department became the standard used by the American Society for Engineering Education to accredit all engineering schools.[16]  In response to the ruling by the Supreme Court of Brown v. Board of Education, the University instituted entrance examinations so as to prevent the mass rush of black high school graduates to enroll at USC.  The examinations were also welcomed because they would promote individual merit over wealth or connections and USC became the first college to introduce entrance examinations.  Thirdly, a massive building and renovation program was initiated and it was made possible through the acquisition of the properties on the southern boundary of the campus.  The renaissance enjoyed by the University became evident by the speakers for commencement addresses and special convocations.  Among the distinguished who came to speak at the University were John F. Kennedy, Carl Sandburg, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Ren Pleven, and John Foster Dulles.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussell resigned in 1957 so that he could run for governor in 1958 and Robert L. Sumwalt was named as the temporary president by the trustees.  By the end of the summer of 1958, Russell had failed to win the Democratic nomination for governor and the University was still without a permanent President.  A movement was started to bring Russell back as the President and he gave positive indications that he would return as President if offered.  Yet, many were opposed because they felt that Russell was opportunistic and would leave the University again for the next gubernatorial campaign.  Russell had also annoyed many associated with the University through his harsh rhetoric against Ernest Hollings on the campaign trail.  The board of trustees was split and instead voted unanimously in 1959 to make Sumwalt the permanent President.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn initiative started by Russell and continued by Sumwalt was the establishment of regional campuses and the formation of the University System.  The first extension campus was set up at Florence in 1957 and additional campuses were gained in Beaufort, Lancaster and Conway in 1959.  Another campus was added to the system in 1961 at Aiken.  The University System served two purposes, it expanded the University's reach across the state and the branch campuses acted as a feeder system for the main campus in Columbia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSumwalt retired in 1962 and he was replaced by Thomas F. Jones as President.  Immediately, Jones was confronted by the integration problem that the University faced.  Clemson admitted Harvey Gantt in January 1963 and it was just a matter of time before the University would be forced to admit blacks.  USC exhausted its legal options in the summer and although large sentiment was against the integration of the University, there was no extra resistance to it requiring federal troops as occurred that same summer at the University of Alabama or at the University of Mississippi the previous year; the latter of which contained violence which had a dramatic conscientious effect on many segregationists in the University community.  A student leader perhaps best expressed the altered sentiments of many when he wrote that while \\"we do not want integration . . . neither do we want to be blamed for the loss of dignity and integrity.\\"[17]  On September 11,  African-Americans Henrie Dobbins Monteith, Robert G. Anderson, and James L. Solomon, Jr. were admitted to the University peacefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next two decades following integration, the University experienced rapid growth and expansion due in large part to the baby boomer generation entering college.  Enrollment stood at 5,660 in 1960, but by 1979 had reached nearly 26,000 students on the Columbia campus alone.  The expansion of the University was not limited to the Columbia campus; additional campuses and colleges were set up throughout the state.  Clemson established an extension center in 1965 at Sumter, only 40 miles (64?km) away from Columbia.  Sol Blatt, then the Speaker of the House, wrote President Tom Jones that \\"the University should build as many two year colleges over the State as rapidly as possible to prevent the expansion of Clemson schools for the Clemson people.\\"[18]  President Jones heeded Blatt's advice and over the next decade, the University added campuses in Allendale, Spartanburg, Union and Walterboro.  The Clemson extension at Sumter never proved popular, and USC acquired the campus in 1973.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe growth of the University in the 1960s and 70s also brought with it the social activism and disorder of the time.  Due to the massive influx of so many students in a short time period, the administration lost control of student life.  Drug and alcohol use became so rampant at the University that it became known as a party school.[19]  Black students protested the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968 by setting fire to Hamilton College and the USC Field House.  On May 7, 1970, approximately 400 students seized the Russell House as a symbolic gesture towards honoring those killed in the Kent State shootings and four days later on May 11, they attempted to meet with the members of the board of trustees, but were rebuffed. Columbia police were called in to quell the student protest but were ineffective. State troopers were also unable to disperse the students. National Guard troops were ordered to the campus by Gov. Bob McNair, and soon dispersed most of the protestors with tear gas. The inability of the administration to control such student outbursts led to President Jones' resignation in 1974. But he had succeeded in turning a sleepy southern college into a full-fledged research institution.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames B. Holderman, a flamboyant and charming executive, was elected President by the board of trustees in 1977.  Right away, Holderman championed a proposal to create an honors college because it would foster an academic environment conducive to excellence necessary to keep South Carolina's best students instate.  The proposal was approved and the first students were admitted into the South Carolina Honors College in 1978.\\r\\n\\r\\nA persistent problem for the University was the Columbia campus's relationship with the semi-autonomous regional campuses.  Once a campus reached a Full-time equivalent of 1,000 students, it was entitled to become a four-year college and the campuses in Aiken, Spartanburg, and Conway took advantage of this rule.  The law providing such a transformation was repealed, but it was apparent that the regional campuses were acting in their own interests and not for the University system.  Furthermore, the Columbia campus had to compete against its regional campuses for funding because each campus submitted its budget to the General Assembly.  To correct these problems, Holderman issued the Carolina Plan that outlined a centralized and unified approach to be taken by the University system.  This meant that it would be necessary for lawmakers to fully fund the University system in order for the branch campus to receive the funds they need.  The Carolina Plan worked brilliantly as the University system was fully funded in 1977 for the first time since 1967.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing up on his success with the Carolina Plan, Holderman issued the Carolina Plan II which called for making USC an international university and a \\"Window to the World.\\"  To achieve his goals, Holderman used his connections and his personal charisma to attract world leaders to the USC campus.  He was able to put USC on the map by bringing in such world leaders as UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, President Ronald Reagan, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and many other foreign dignitaries.  The highlight of the visits was that of Pope John Paul II in 1987.  He exclaimed on the Horseshoe that \\"it is wonderful to be young and a student at the University of South Carolina.\\"[20]  The Pope later led a non-denominational service before more than 60,000 at Williams-Brice Stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe international spotlight on the University came at a price and an inquisitive journalism student led to Holderman's downfall.  Paul Perkins, a journalism student upset with tuition increases, requested that the University release the salary of visiting professor Jehan Sadat.  Holderman balked and refused to release the details even after Perkins and his wife Cheryl filed a Freedom of Information Act request.  This denial and the secrecy on the part of the administration led the media to scrutinize other aspects of Holderman's presidency.  They inspected his travel budgets and construction contracts and found overwhelming evidence of financial irregularities and extravagant spending.  In face of all the negative publicity, Holderman resigned in 1990. Holderman would later be convicted of laundering drug money in 2003.[21] The University trustees elected John M. Palms to succeed Holderman to restore the institution's credibility and respect in the state and world. After leading the University's bicentennial celebrations in 2001,[22] Palms retired and was replaced by Andrew A. Sorensen in 2002. During his tenure from 2002 to 2008, Sorensen raised large sums for research, including a $300 million grant for colorectal cancer. In the spirit of Palms' \\"Cathedrals of Excellence\\" budgeting philosophy, the board of directors moved to transform university land on Assembly Street into an \\"innovation district\\" called Innovista that will develop four strengths: biomedicine, nanotechnology, environmental science and alternative fuels. The Board of Trustees announced the selection of Harris Pastides as the University's 28th president on July 11, 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent literary societies were an important part of student life at Carolina for the first 150 years or so. The Philomathic was the first such society and was formed within weeks of the opening of SCC in 1805; it included practically the whole student body. In 1806 it was split into the Clariosophic and Euphradian societies.[23]\\r\\nAfter the university admitted women students, the Hypatian Society was founded in 1915 for women, followed by the Euphrosynean Society in 1924.[24] While both the Clariosophic and Euphradian Societies were deactivated in the 1970s, alumni from the Euphradian Society reactivated the organization in 2010. It continues to operate to this day.","input":"When was the university of south carolina founded?"},{"output":"1,100 rounds","context":"24 guns in total, including:[1]\\r\\nThe 2017 Las Vegas shooting occurred on the night of Sunday, October 1 when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, leaving 58 people dead and 851 injured. Between 10:05 and 10:15?p.m. PDT, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, fired more than 1,100 rounds from his suite on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel. About an hour after he fired his last shot into the crowd, he was found dead in his room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His motive remains unknown.\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States. It reignited the debate about gun laws in the U.S., with attention focused on bump fire stocks, which Paddock used to allow his semi-automatic rifles to fire at a rate similar to that of a fully automatic weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Strip is a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard immediately south of the city of Las Vegas in Clark County, Nevada. The Strip is known for its concentration of casinos and resort hotels, including the 43-story Mandalay Bay southwest of its intersection with Mandalay Bay Road, in the unincorporated town of Paradise.[2]\\r\\nLas Vegas Village, a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) lot used for outdoor performances, is located diagonally across the intersection to the northeast.[2][3] From 2014 onward, the venue hosted the annual Route 91 Harvest country music festival. The 2017 festival ran from September 29 to October 1, with over 22,000 attendees on the final day.[3][4][a]\\r\\nStephen Paddock was a 64-year-old former auditor and real estate businessman, who had been living 80 miles (130?km) northeast of Las Vegas in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada.[5] Paddock was twice divorced, had a long-term girlfriend, and had no known children.[6] His father was Benjamin Paddock, a bank robber who was on the FBI's most-wanted list between 1969 and 1977.[6] Paddock's only recorded interactions with law enforcement, however, were traffic citations.[7]\\r\\nPaddock was a high-stakes gambler who placed bets at a high enough level to earn valuable compsfree benefits such as rooms and meals.[8] He was a familiar figure to casino hosts in Las Vegas, but was not well known among other high-stakes gamblers because he mostly played video poker.[8] He reportedly kept to himself and was a heavy drinker.[9] Paddock had lost a significant amount of his wealth over the previous two years,[10] but had paid off all gambling debts before the shooting.[11]\\r\\nPaddock may have considered attacking other events. He had researched large-scale venues in cities such as Boston since at least May 2017,[11] and had reserved a room overlooking the August 2017 Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, but did not use it.[12] According to his girlfriend, during an earlier stay at the Mandalay Bay in early September 2017, he repeatedly examined Las Vegas Village from different windows in their room.[13] From September 17, Paddock stayed at The Ogden in Downtown Las Vegas, which overlooked the open-air Life Is Beautiful festival that ran from September 22 to September 24.[13][4] His internet search terms from mid-September included \\"swat weapons\\", \\"ballistics chart 308\\", \\"SWAT Las Vegas\\", and \\"do police use explosives\\".[13]\\r\\nPaddock arrived at the Mandalay Bay on September 25, 2017. He was booked into Room 32-135, a complimentary room on the 32nd floor.[4][8] Four days later, he also checked into the neighboring directly-connected Room 32-134. Both suites overlook Las Vegas Village.[4][14][b] Between September 25 and October 1, the day of the shooting, he stockpiled an arsenal of weapons, associated equipment, and ammunition including fourteen AR-15 rifles (twelve of which had bump stocks and 100-round magazines), eight AR-10 rifles, a bolt-action rifle, and a revolver (see ?Weaponry). He transported five suitcases to his room on September 25, seven on the 26th, two on the 28th, six on the 30th, and two on October 1.[15][13][4] On September 30, he had placed \\"Do not disturb\\" signs on both rooms' doors.[15] Paddock interacted with Mandalay Bay employees more than ten times during his stay, including twice on the day of the shooting; an MGM Resorts International spokesperson said they were all \\"normal in nature\\".[16]\\r\\nThe mass shooting occurred between 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. PDT on October 1, 2017 (the third and final night of the festival). When the shooting began, country music singer Jason Aldean was giving the closing performance.[17]\\r\\nShortly before 10:00?p.m., hotel security guard Jesus Campos was sent to the 32nd floor to investigate an open-door alert. He attempted to open a door that immediately accessed the floor, but found that it would not open. After Campos entered the floor, he discovered an L-shaped bracket screwed into the door and door frame, which was responsible for barring the door from opening. After reporting the discovery to his dispatch center, he heard a rapid drilling sound coming from Room 32-135 and he went to investigate the matter. At approximately 10:05, he was hit in the right thigh by one of about 200 bullets that Paddock fired through the door of his suite. After Campos was hit, he took cover in the alcove between Rooms 32-122 and 32-124 and immediately informed the hotel by radio and cellphone that he had been shot, though he believed he had been shot with a BB or pellet gun. At the same time, maintenance worker Stephen Schuck was on the same floor to fix the barricaded door reported by Campos. Campos, who was already injured, encountered Schuck and told him to take cover. Schuck contacted hotel dispatchers over his radio, informed them of the ongoing shooting, and told them to call the police.[4][18][19][20][21] Neither Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department nor MGM Resorts International, the Mandalay Bay's owner, have confirmed when information about the initial shooting was relayed to the police.[22][23][24][25]\\r\\nPaddock had used a hammer to break two of the windows in both of his suites[4] and at 10:05?p.m. began shooting through them.[26] He ultimately fired more than 1,100 rifle rounds[27] approximately 490 yards (450?m) into the festival audience.[28][29][30][c] He initially started out with a few single gunshots before firing in prolonged bursts.[4] Many people in the crowd initially mistook the gunfire for fireworks.[31] During the shooting, a security fence hindered concertgoers from fleeing the 15-acre concrete lot.[32] The gunfire continued, with some momentary pauses, over the span of ten minutes and ended by 10:15?p.m.[33][34]\\r\\nPaddock fired eight bullets at a large jet fuel tank at McCarran International Airport 2,000 feet (600?m) away.[4] Only two of the bullets struck its exterior, and one of them penetrated the tank, but the fuel did not explode because jet fuel is mostly made of kerosene and is unlikely to be ignited by a bullet.[35]\\r\\nDuring the shooting, police officers were initially confused whether the shots were coming from the Mandalay Bay, the nearby Luxor hotel, or the festival grounds.[32] There were also multiple false reports of additional shooters at other hotels on the Strip.[36] Officers eventually spotted multiple flashes of gunfire in the middle of the northern side of Mandalay Bay and responded to the hotel. At 10:12?p.m., two officers on the 31st floor reported the sounds of gunfire on the floor above them.[32] When officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17?p.m. and encountered Campos a minute later, he directed them to Paddock's room and helped others evacuate. Campos was then directed to seek medical attention for himself.[19][21]\\r\\nBetween 10:26 and 10:30?p.m., an additional eight officers arrived at the 32nd floor, with some of them manually breaching through the door Paddock had screwed shut with the bracket. The gunfire had ceased, and the police moved systematically down the hallway, searching and clearing each room, using a master key that was provided by Campos. At 10:55?p.m., the officers finished evacuating guests. At 11:20?p.m., police breached Room 32-135 with explosives.[4][32][34][37] Paddock was found dead on the floor from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.[38][39] Police then breached Room 32-134; while entering the hotel suite, an officer accidentally fired a three-round burst from his weapon, but the bullets did not hit anyone.[4][40] At 11:27?p.m., officers announced over the police radio that one suspect was down.[34][41] Early on October 2, Sheriff Lombardo identified the suspect as Stephen Paddock.[42]\\r\\nThe shooting killed 58 people at the music festival; Paddock's suicide was the only death at the Mandalay Bay Hotel.[43][44][45] The fatalities included 36 women and 22 men.[43] The oldest was 67, the youngest 20.[46] Six were from Nevada, 35 from California, 13 from other states, and four from Canada.[47] The Clark County Coroner's Office determined that all 58 victims died as a result of gunshot wounds.[48] 31 of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene, while the rest were pronounced dead at hospitals.[11]\\r\\nAn additional 851 people were injured, 422 of them with gunshot wounds.[24][49] In the aftermath, many victims were transported to area hospitals, which included University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center, and at least one of the six hospitals of Valley Health System.[50][51][52] Sunrise Hospital treated the largest portion of the wounded: 199 patients,[53] 150 of whom arrived within a timespan of about 40 minutes.[54] For reasons that are unclear, most patients were transported to Sunrise, a Level II trauma center. University Medical Center, a nearby Level I trauma center, treated 104 patients.[55] Six victims sought medical treatment in Southern California; UC Irvine Medical Center treated four and Loma Linda University Medical Center treated two.[56]\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States, surpassing by 9 the death toll of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, where 49 people were shot and killed.[43][57][58]\\r\\nMuch of Las Vegas Boulevard was closed while police SWAT teams combed the venue and neighboring businesses. McCarran International Airport, adjacent to the shooting site, was shut down for several hours.[59] Approximately 300 people entered the airport property as they fled to safety from the shooting.[31] This prompted officials to shut down all four runways. More than 25 flights were rerouted to ensure that no aircraft would be hit by gunfire,[36] while other flights were canceled before airfield operations resumed at 12:40?a.m. on October 2.[60] At approximately 2:45?p.m. PDT on October 2, a state of emergency was declared in Clark County.[61][62]\\r\\nOn the morning after the shooting, lines to donate blood in Las Vegas stretched for blocks. Wait times were as much as six hours or more.[63] Millions of dollars have also been raised to help victims and their families.[64]\\r\\nIn the hours and days after the shooting, false information and fake news about the shooter's identity and motive went viral on social media:\\r\\nGoogle and Facebook were criticized for displaying such false news stories in some of their search results.[68][75][76] The two technology companies were said to have failed in their responsibility of keeping false stories from reaching the public.[77] Facebook later said its algorithms were designed to detect and remove false stories, but failed to work adequately in this instance.[75]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, some media outlets reported that YouTube search results for information about the shooting returned links to conspiracy videos. YouTube stated that it had tweaked its search algorithm to promote news sources which it considered more authoritative.[78][79]\\r\\nNevada Governor Brian Sandoval called the shooting \\"a tragic and heinous act of violence that has shaken the Nevada family\\".[80] Jason Aldean, who was singing when the shooting started, posted his condolences on Instagram and noted all of those working with him at the show had survived the attack.[81]\\r\\nAt a press conference, President Donald Trump described Paddock as \\"a very very sick individual\\", and \\"a demented man, [with] a lot of problems\\". He added, \\"the police department has done such an incredible job, and we'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by\\".[82][83] A White House official talking points memo, distributed to Trump allies, opposed tightening gun control since \\"new laws won't stop a mad man\\", but \\"will curtail the freedoms of law abiding citizens\\".[84] On October 2, Trump issued a proclamation to honor the victims and their families.[85][86] On October 4, Trump visited the shooting victims and first responders.[87] On October 7, Vice President Mike Pence participated in a unity prayer walk and ceremony in Las Vegas in honor of the dead.[88]\\r\\nThe shooting prompted support in the U.S. Congress for assault weapons legislation that would ban bump fire stocks. The National Rifle Association (NRA) came out in favor of administrative bump fire stock regulations.[43] Many Congressional Democrats and some Republicans expressed their support of a prohibition of bump fire stocks.[89] Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a Senate bill that gained 39 Democratic co-sponsors. Two bipartisan bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives. As of November, no Congressional action has been taken. House leaders said the issue of bump fire stock regulation should be decided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which originally approved gun-stocks.[90] On November 6, Massachusetts became the first state to ban the sale, possession, or use of the devices.[91]\\r\\nNine days after the shooting, eighteen Democratic U.S. Senators introduced a bill, the Keep Americans Safe Act, which, if signed into law, would ban gun magazines that hold more than ten rounds of ammunition.[92]\\r\\nStock prices of firearms manufacturers rose the day after the shooting, as has happened after similar incidents. Investors expect gun sales will increase over concerns that such an event could lead to more stringent gun-control legislation and a rush of customers wishing to defend themselves against future attacks.[93][94]\\r\\nSurvivors of the shooting have received death threats on social media; they have also been accused of being paid actors.[95]\\r\\nThe annual Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Marathon took place on November 12 and was the largest event to be held in the city since the shooting. The event received a massive amount of security, which included 350 officers, counter-sniper surveillance posts, and a number of barriers composed of dump trucks, buses, and other large vehicles.[96]\\r\\nThe future of the Las Vegas Village site remains undetermined.[97]\\r\\nAccording to authorities with the Clark County Commissioner, the name \\"1 October\\" was declared the official title for investigations into the mass shooting.[98]\\r\\nInvestigators found hidden surveillance cameras that were placed inside and outside the hotel room, presumably so Paddock could monitor the arrival of others.[99] The cameras were not in record mode.[100] Police said a handwritten note found in the room indicated Paddock had been calculating the distance, wind, and trajectory from his 32nd floor hotel suite to the concertgoers he was targeting on the festival lot.[101][102]\\r\\nAt a press conference on October 4, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo stated there was evidencewhich he declined to discussthat Paddock intended to escape the scene, and that he may have had assistance from an accomplice.[103] Investigators searched Paddock's room and found a \\"bulletproof vest\\" and breathing apparatus, which were survival gear that Paddock never used.[104]\\r\\nThere have been several changes in the official account and timeline of Paddock's shooting of hotel security guard Campos. Police officials described these adjustments as \\"minute changes\\" that are common in complex investigations.[19]\\r\\nIn their first statement about the incident, police officials inaccurately reported that Campos arrived on the scene after Paddock began firing into the crowd. In a second statement, police officials reported, again inaccurately, that Campos was shot six minutes before Paddock began firing into the crowd. That report had been based on a 9:59?p.m. notation in a hotel security log, which in a third statement was determined to have been the time when Campos encountered the barricaded door.[18][20]\\r\\nSheriff Lombardo dismissed allegations that the changing timeline was the result of some kind of conspiracy between the police department, the FBI, and MGM Resorts International saying, \\"Nobody is attempting to hide anything in reference to this investigation. The dynamics and the size of this investigation requires us to go through voluminous amounts of information in order to draw an accurate picture.\\"[18]\\r\\nAlthough the investigation remains ongoing, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department released a preliminary report on the event on January 18, 2018.[4]\\r\\nPolice speculate that Paddock acted alone and have not determined his motive.

[105]\\r\\nOn February 2, 2018, Douglas Haig, an Arizonan ammunition dealer, was charged in a Nevada federal court with \\"conspiracy to manufacture and sell armor-piercing ammunition without a license\\" after his fingerprints were discovered on unfired armor-piercing ammunition inside Paddock's suite.[106]\\r\\nTwenty-four firearms, a large quantity of ammunition, and numerous high-capacity magazines capable of holding up to 100 rounds apiece were found in the suite.[1][107][108] Fourteen of the firearms were .223-caliber AR-15-type semi-automatic rifles: three manufactured by Colt, two by Daniel Defense, two by FN Herstal, two by LWRC International, two by POF-USA, one with a .223 Wylde chamber by Christensen Arms, one made-to-order by LMT, and one by Noveske. The others were eight .308-caliber AR-10-type rifles, one .308-caliber Ruger American bolt-action rifle, and one .38-caliber Smith & Wesson Model 342 revolver.[1][109][110][111] The AR-15 rifles were fitted with vertical forward grips and bump fire stocks,[1][109] the latter of which allowed for recoil to actuate their triggers at a rate of 90 rounds in 10 seconds.[112] The AR-10 rifles were equipped with various telescopic sights and mounted on bipods.[1][113][114] The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that the firearms found in his hotel room, along with more guns found in his homes, had been legally purchased in Nevada, California, Texas, and Utah.[115] In the month preceding the shooting, he had attempted to purchase tracer ammunition, but the gun dealer he approached did not have the item in stock.[116] He bought tracer ammunition from a private seller at a Phoenix, Arizona gun show.[117]\\r\\nDuring subsequent investigations, ammonium nitrate (often used in improvised explosive devices) was found in the trunk of his Hyundai Tucson SUV, along with 1,600 rounds of ammunition and 50 pounds (23?kg) of Tannerite, a binary explosive used to make explosive targets for gun ranges.[118][119] Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said that while Paddock had \\"nefarious intent\\" with the material, he did not appear to have assembled an explosive device.[116][120]","input":"How many rounds did the vegas shooter have?"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):y("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(I,[["render",x]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/17.md","filePath":"qapage/17.md"}'),F={name:"qapage/17.md"},H=Object.assign(F,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{D as __pageData,H as default};
