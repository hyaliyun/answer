It has the highest concentration of organic matter and microorganisms and is where most of the Earth 's biological soil activity occurs . Four elements constitute the composition of soil . Those elements are mineral particles , organic matter , water , and air . The volume of top soil consists of 50 to 80 percent of these particles which form the skeletal structure of most soils . This composition allows the soil to sustain its own weight , and other internal matter such as water and overlying landscape . Organic matter , another important element , varies on quantity on different soils . This provokes positive and negative effects or reactions on the soil . The strength of soil structure decreases with the presence of organic matter , creating weak bearing capacities . Organic matter condenses and or settles in different ways under certain conditions , such as roadbeds and foundations . The skeletal structure becomes affected once the soil is dewatered . The soil 's volume substantially decreases . It decomposes and suffers wind erosion ."},{"query":"when did the grand prix move to belle isle","short_answer":"","abstract":"The title of Detroit Grand Prix was applied to the Formula One races held at the Detroit street circuit in Detroit , Michigan , United States of America from 1982 through 1988 ."},{"query":"when did halloween become an official holiday in the us","short_answer":"","abstract":"Halloween or Hallowe'en ( a contraction of All Hallows ' Evening ) , also known as Allhalloween , All Hallows ' Eve , or All Saints ' Eve , is a celebration observed in a number of countries on 31 October , the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows ' Day .

If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle , the wave can not pass through and is entirely reflected . The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs . This is particularly common as an optical phenomenon , where light waves are involved , but it occurs with many types of waves , such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves . When a wave reaches a boundary between different materials with different refractive indices , the wave will in general be partially refracted at the boundary surface , and partially reflected . However , if the angle of incidence is greater ( i.e. the direction of propagation is closer to being parallel to the boundary ) than the critical angle -- the angle of incidence at which light is refracted such that it travels along the boundary -- then the wave will not cross the boundary , but will instead be totally reflected back internally . This can only occur when the wave in a medium with a higher refractive index ( n ) reaches a boundary with a medium of lower refractive index ( n ) . For example , it will occur with light reaching air from glass , but not when reaching glass from air ."},{"query":"which is an example of a right the american revolutionaries were fighting for","short_answer":"","abstract":"The American Revolution was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783 .

The renal medulla is split up into a number of sections , known as the renal pyramids . Blood enters into the kidney via the renal artery , which then splits up to form the interlobar arteries . The interlobar arteries each in turn branch into arcuate arteries , which in turn branch to form interlobular arteries , and these finally reach the glomeruli . At the glomerulus the blood reaches a highly disfavourable pressure gradient and a large exchange surface area , which forces the serum portion of the blood out of the vessel and into the renal tubules .

If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle , the wave can not pass through and is entirely reflected . The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs . This is particularly common as an optical phenomenon , where light waves are involved , but it occurs with many types of waves , such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves . When a wave reaches a boundary between different materials with different refractive indices , the wave will in general be partially refracted at the boundary surface , and partially reflected . However , if the angle of incidence is greater ( i.e. the direction of propagation is closer to being parallel to the boundary ) than the critical angle -- the angle of incidence at which light is refracted such that it travels along the boundary -- then the wave will not cross the boundary , but will instead be totally reflected back internally . This can only occur when the wave in a medium with a higher refractive index ( n ) reaches a boundary with a medium of lower refractive index ( n ) . For example , it will occur with light reaching air from glass , but not when reaching glass from air ."},{"query":"what is the role of philosopher in french revolution","short_answer":"","abstract":"French philosophy , here taken to mean philosophy in the French language , has been extremely diverse and has influenced Western philosophy as a whole for centuries , from the medieval scholasticism of Peter Abelard , through the founding of modern philosophy by René Descartes , to 20th century philosophy of science , existentialism , phenomenology , structuralism and Postmodernism ."},{"query":"3 dog night one is the loneliest number lyrics","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` One '' is a song written by Harry Nilsson and made famous by Three Dog Night whose recording reached number five on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1969 and number four in Canada .

Visual search can take place with or without eye movements . The ability to consciously locate an object or target amongst a complex array of stimuli has been extensively studied over the past 40 years . Practical examples of using visual search can be seen in everyday life , such as when one is picking out a product on a supermarket shelf , when animals are searching for food amongst piles of leaves , when trying to find your friend in a large crowd of people , or simply when playing visual search games such as Where 's Wally ? Many visual search paradigms have used eye movement as a means to measure the degree of attention given to stimuli . However , vast research to date suggests that eye movements move independently of attention , and therefore are not a reliable method to examine the role of attention . Much previous literature on visual search uses reaction time in order to measure the time it takes to detect the target amongst its distractors . An example of this could be a green square ( the target ) amongst a set of red circles ( the distractors ) ."},{"query":"what percentage of us trade is with china","short_answer":"16.9 %","abstract":"The 20 largest trade partners of the United States represent 76.6 % of U.S. exports , and 81.0 % of U.S. imports as of December 2014 .

Some of these federal programs included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . These programs included support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly as well as new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and changes to the monetary system . Most programs were enacted between 1933 -- 1938 , though some were later . They included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders , most during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the \`\` 3 Rs '' : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 -- 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as an alleged enemy of business and growth and liberals accepting some of it and promising to make it more efficient . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress from 1939 -- 1964 ."},{"query":"what is the main food in puerto rico","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"when was the last time the constitution was ammended","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Constitution of Tanzania , formally Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania and also known as Permanent Constitution or Fourth Constitution of Tanzania , was ratified in 1977 .

This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors .

It is composed of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule . The renal corpuscle consists of a tuft of capillaries called a glomerulus and an encompassing Bowman 's capsule . The renal tubule extends from the capsule . The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen . A healthy adult has 0.8 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney . Blood is filtered as it passes through three layers : the endothelial cells of the capillary wall , its basement membrane , and between the foot processes of the podocytes of the lining of the capsule . The tubule has adjacent peritubular capillaries that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule . As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule , it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule : water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged ( some are added , others are removed ) ; first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules , and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary . This process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances .

Fitted on almost all civilian aircraft today , they are high electrical resistance ( 6 - 200 megaohm ) devices with a lower corona voltage than the surrounding aircraft structure . They control the corona discharge into the atmosphere . They are used on aircraft to allow the continuous satisfactory operation of onboard navigation and radio communication systems during precipitation ( p - static ) conditions . Precipitation static is an electrical charge on an airplane caused by flying through rain , snow , ice , or dust particles . When the aircraft charge is great enough , it discharges into the surrounding air . Without static dischargers , the charge discharges in large batches through pointed aircraft extremities , such as antennas , wing tips , vertical and horizontal stabilizers , and other protrusions . The discharge creates a broad - band radio frequency noise from DC to 1000 MHz , which can affect aircraft communication . Static dischargers contain sharper points than any other part of the aircraft , cause the charge to discharge through them instead , and do so gradually ."},{"query":"who invented bubble gum and in what year","short_answer":"","abstract":"Walter E.

In geology , rock or superficial deposits , fossils and lithologies can be used to correlate one stratigraphic column with another . Prior to the discovery of radiometric dating in the early 20th century , which provided a means of absolute dating , archaeologists and geologists used relative dating to determine ages of materials . Though relative dating can only determine the sequential order in which a series of events occurred , not when they occurred , it remains a useful technique . Relative dating by biostratigraphy is the preferred method in paleontology and is , in some respects , more accurate . The Law of Superposition , which states that older layers will be deeper in a site than more recent layers , was the summary outcome of ' relative dating ' as observed in geology from the 17th century to the early 20th century ."},{"query":"what episode of the partridge family did they sing i think i love you","short_answer":"8","abstract":"The following is a list of episodes for the American television sitcom The Partridge Family .

Another name for food web is consumer - resource system . Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels : 1 ) the autotrophs , and 2 ) the heterotrophs . To maintain their bodies , grow , develop , and to reproduce , autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances , including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide . These chemical reactions require energy , which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis , although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs . A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere , to mixotrophs ( such as carnivorous plants ) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere , and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter . The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways , such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs . The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange . There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory , carnivory , scavenging and parasitism . Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs , such as sugars , provides energy . Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes , from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods , and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales ."},{"query":"who plays the daughter on schitt's creek","short_answer":"","abstract":"Schitt 's Creek ( stylized as Schitt Creek ) is a Canadian television sitcom created by Eugene Levy and his son Dan Levy , that premiered on CBC Television on January 13 , 2015 .

Bowen who summarized , based on experiments and observations of natural rocks , the crystallization sequence of typical basaltic magma undergoing fractional crystallization ( i.e. , crystallization wherein early - formed crystals are removed from the magma by crystal settling , say , leaving behind a liquid of slightly different composition ) . Bowen 's reaction series is able to explain why certain types of minerals tend to be found together while others are almost never associated with one another . He experimented in the early 1900s with powdered rock material that was heated until it melted and then allowed to cool to a target temperature whereupon he observed the types of minerals that formed in the rocks produced . He repeated this process with progressively cooler temperatures and the results he obtained led him to formulate his reaction series which is still accepted today as the idealized progression of minerals produced by cooling basaltic magma that undergoes fractional crystallization . Based upon Bowen 's work , one can infer from the minerals present in a rock the relative conditions under which the material had formed ."},{"query":"when does season 2 of lost in oz come out","short_answer":"","abstract":"Lost In Oz is a Daytime Emmy Award - winning animated series that premiered in full on August 7 , 2017 streaming on Amazon Video .

Within an embryo , 4 processes play out at the cellular and tissue level to essentially create the final organism . These processes are cell proliferation , cell specialization , cell interaction and cell movement . Each cell in the embryo receives and gives cues to its neighboring cells and retains a cell memory of its own cell proliferation history . Almost all animals undergo a similar sequence of events during embryogenesis and have , at least at this developmental stage , the three germ layers and undergo gastrulation . While embryogenesis has been studied for more than a century , it was only recently ( the past 15 years or so ) that scientists discovered that a basic set of the same proteins and mRNAs are involved in all of embryogenesis . This is one of the reasons that model systems such as the fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) , the mouse ( Muridae ) , and the leech ( Helobdella ) , can all be used to study embryogenesis and developmental biology relevant to other animals , including humans . The fate map of the nematode ( Caenorhabditis ) can be analyzed down to the cellular level . This is due no cell mixing during development . What continues to be discovered and investigated is how the basic set of proteins ( and mRNAs ) are expressed differentially between cells types , temporally and spatially ; and whether this is responsible for the vast diversity of organisms produced .

Samuelson ( 1948 ) , which states that the prices of identical factors of production , such as the wage rate , or the rent of capital , will be equalized across countries as a result of international trade in commodities . The theorem assumes that there are two goods and two factors of production , for example capital and labour . Other key assumptions of the theorem are that each country faces the same commodity prices , because of free trade in commodities , uses the same technology for production , and produces both goods . Crucially these assumptions result in factor prices being equalized across countries without the need for factor mobility , such as migration of labor or capital flows ."},{"query":"list of deemed medical colleges in andhra pradesh","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of deemed universities in India established under Section 3 of UGC Act , 1956 ."},{"query":"who did houston rockets play in the finals","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what radio station is georgia oklahoma game on","short_answer":"","abstract":"This listing of radio stations that are branded as ESPN Radio is an incomplete sampling of major markets in 2011 .

The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex , including conquest , wars , and alliances at various points in history . The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union . The British press relishes the chance to refer to France and Britain as \`\` historic rivals '' or emphasize the perceived ever - lasting competition that still opposes the two countries ."},{"query":"who is the inventor of the tesla coil","short_answer":"Tesla","abstract":"Nikola Tesla ( / ˈtɛslə / ; Serbian Cyrillic : Никола Тесла Serbo - Croatian pronunciation : ( nikoːla tesla ) ; 10 July 1856 -- 7 January 1943 ) was a Serbian - American inventor , electrical engineer , mechanical engineer , physicist , and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current ( AC ) electricity supply system ."},{"query":"who plays alex in the big bang theory","short_answer":"Margo Cathleen Harshman","abstract":"Margo Cathleen Harshman ( born March 4 , 1986 ) is an American actress known for her role as Tawny Dean on the Disney Channel series Even Stevens .

Thus , the rate equation is often shown as having first - order dependence on electrophile and zero - order dependence on nucleophile . This relationship holds for situations where the amount of nucleophile is much greater than that of the carbocation intermediate . Instead , the rate equation may be more accurately described using steady - state kinetics . The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate and is commonly seen in reactions of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or , under strongly acidic conditions , with secondary or tertiary alcohols . With primary and secondary alkyl halides , the alternative S 2 reaction occurs . In inorganic chemistry , the S 1 reaction is often known as the dissociative mechanism . This dissociation pathway is well - described by the cis effect . A reaction mechanism was first proposed by Christopher Ingold et al. in 1940 . This reaction does not depend much on the strength of the nucleophile unlike the S 2 mechanism . This type of mechanism involves two steps . The first step is the reversible ionization of Alkyl halide in the presence of aqueous acetone or an aqueous ethyl alcohol . This step provides a carbocation as an intermediate . In the second step this carbocation is attacked by the nucleophile to form the product ."},{"query":"what is the order of the highschool dxd series","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"how many employees does walmart have in the us","short_answer":"1.4 million","abstract":"Walmart Inc.

Its original MAA rating mark was an inverted star until disestablished ( 1797 -- 1921 ) . On 20 May 1958 the inverted star reemerged as a nod to the Historical MAA Rating whose duty was to provide good order and discipline aboard ships over the enlisted crews . Public Law 85 - 422 , the Military Pay Act of 1958 , established two new enlisted pay grades of E-8 and E-9 in all five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces . In the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard , the new E-8 pay grade was titled Senior Chief Petty Officer and the new E-9 pay grade as Master Chief Petty Officer ; as a result it was designated a single ( E-8 ) or double ( E-9 ) inverted star above the anchor for all collar devices and rating badges this point forward . The MCPON Rating ( 1971 ) specialty mark was established using the former MAA inverted star and later expanded to the Command Rates of Fleet / Command Master Chief ( 1995 ) or Senior Chief ( 2015 ) Ratings . The current MAA rating mark following its reestablishment has been a police badge with internal star ( 1973 -- present ) , emblematic of its police or sheriff duties as a modern law enforcement specialist ."},{"query":"make a chart on major domains of the earth","short_answer":"","abstract":"Eukaryota ( represented by the Australian green tree frog , left ) , Bacteria ( represented by Staphylococcus aureus , middle ) and"},{"query":"differentiate between innate and adaptive immunity toll like receptors","short_answer":"","abstract":"Pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) play a crucial role in the proper function of the innate immune system .

Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years , with large - scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature .
