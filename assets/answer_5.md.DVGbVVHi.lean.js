Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year .

The U.S. Senate voted in favor of ratifying it with amendments on April 25 , 1854 , and then transmitted it to 14th President Franklin Pierce . Mexico 's government and its General Congress or Congress of the Union took final approval action on June 8 , 1854 .

Most species whose cells have nuclei ( eukaryotes ) are diploid , meaning they have two sets of chromosomes -- one set inherited from each parent . However , polyploidy is found in some organisms and is especially common in plants . In addition , polyploidy occurs in some tissues of animals that are otherwise diploid , such as human muscle tissues . This is known as endopolyploidy . Species whose cells do not have nuclei , that is , prokaryotes , may be polyploid , as seen in the large bacterium Epulopiscium fishelsoni . Hence ploidy is defined with respect to a cell . Most eukaryotes have diploid somatic cells , but produce haploid gametes ( eggs and sperm ) by meiosis . A monoploid has only one set of chromosomes , and the term is usually only applied to cells or organisms that are normally diploid . Male bees and other Hymenoptera , for example , are monoploid . Unlike animals , plants and multicellular algae have life cycles with two alternating multicellular generations . The gametophyte generation is haploid , and produces gametes by mitosis , the sporophyte generation is diploid and produces spores by meiosis ."},{"query":"when has congress used the power of the purse","short_answer":"","abstract":"The power of the purse is the ability of one group to manipulate and control the actions of another group by withholding funding , or putting stipulations on the use of funds .

These diagrams depict elements as points in the plane , and sets as regions inside closed curves . A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves , usually circles , each representing a set . The points inside a curve labelled S represent elements of the set S , while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set S. Thus , for example , the set of all elements that are members of both sets S and T , S ∩ T , is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions S and T. In Venn diagrams the curves are overlapped in every possible way , showing all possible relations between the sets . They are thus a special case of Euler diagrams , which do not necessarily show all relations . Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by John Venn . They are used to teach elementary set theory , as well as illustrate simple set relationships in probability , logic , statistics , linguistics and computer science ."},{"query":"who wrote the country song when you say nothing at all","short_answer":"Paul Overstreet|Don Schlitz","abstract":"\`\` When You Say Nothing at All '' is a country song written by Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz .

Most commonly the cell changes to a more specialized type . Differentiation occurs numerous times during the development of a multicellular organism as it changes from a simple zygote to a complex system of tissues and cell types . Differentiation continues in adulthood as adult stem cells divide and create fully differentiated daughter cells during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover . Some differentiation occurs in response to antigen exposure . Differentiation dramatically changes a cell 's size , shape , membrane potential , metabolic activity , and responsiveness to signals . These changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression and are the study of epigenetics . With a few exceptions , cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself .

The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex , including conquest , wars , and alliances at various points in history . The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO , the western military alliance led by the United States . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union .

For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability . For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible , the energy release ( see below ) or Q value must be positive ."},{"query":"when did the original karate kid come out","short_answer":"June 22 , 1984","abstract":"The Karate Kid is a 1984 American martial arts drama film produced by Jerry Weintraub , directed by John G.

They advanced Luther 's positions against what he saw as the abuse of the practice of clergy selling plenary indulgences , which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment for sins committed by the purchasers or their loved ones in purgatory . In the Theses , Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than merely external sacramental confession . He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin , believing that they could forgo it by purchasing an indulgence . They also , according to Luther , discouraged Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy , believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable . Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the Pope , the Theses challenge a 14th - century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins . The Theses are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther 's opinions , but Luther later clarified his views in the Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences ."},{"query":"what does the five-fold ministry mean in the bible","short_answer":"","abstract":"The fivefold ministry or five-fold ministry is a Neo-charismatic Christian belief that five offices mentioned in Ephesians ( Ephesians 4 : 11 ) , namely those of apostles , prophets , evangelists , pastors ( or \`\` shepherds '' ) and teachers , remain active and valid offices in the contemporary Christian Church ."},{"query":"who wrote the all in the family theme song","short_answer":"Lee Adams|Charles Strouse","abstract":"All in the Family is an American sitcom TV - series that was originally broadcast on the CBS television network for nine seasons , from January 1971 to April 1979 .

The concept of the common good differs significantly among philosophical doctrines . Early conceptions of the common good were set out by Ancient Greek philosophers , including Aristotle and Plato . One understanding of the common good rooted in Aristotle 's philosophy remains in common usage today , referring to what one contemporary scholar calls the \`\` good proper to , and attainable only by , the community , yet individually shared by its members . '' The concept of common good developed through the work of political theorists , moral philosophers , and public economists , including Thomas Aquinas , Niccolò Machiavelli , John Locke , Jean - Jacques Rousseau , James Madison , Adam Smith , Karl Marx , John Stuart Mill , John Rawls , and many other thinkers . In contemporary economic theory , a common good is any good which is rivalrous yet non-excludable , while the common good , by contrast , arises in the subfield of welfare economics and refers to the outcome of a social welfare function . Such a social welfare function , in turn , would be rooted in a moral theory of the good ( such as utilitarianism ) . Social choice theory aims to understand processes by which the common good may or may not be realized in societies through the study of collective decision rules . And public choice theory applies microeconomic methodology to the study of political science in order to explain how private interests affect political activities and outcomes ."},{"query":"who won all england open championship in 2001","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"two spanish cities on the north coast of africa","short_answer":"","abstract":"Melilla ( / məˈliːjə / mə - LEE - yə ; Spanish : ( meˈliʎa ) , locally ( meˈliʝa ) ; Arabic : مليلية ‎ , Maliliyyah ; Berber languages : ⵎⵔⵉⵜⵙ , Mřič ) is a Spanish autonomous city located on the north coast of Africa , sharing a border with Morocco , with an area of 12.3 km ( 4.7 sq mi ) .

They are tyrosine - based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism . T and T are partially composed of iodine ( see molecular model ) . A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T and T , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre . The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T ) , which has a longer half - life than T. In humans , the ratio of T to T released into the blood is sometimes claimed to be quite high , but thyroid removal patient data suggests it to vary between 4 : 1 to 2 : 1 , the average being 100 : 36 ( roughly 2.8 : 1 ) . T is converted to the active T ( three to four times more potent than T ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5 ' - iodinase ) . These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T a ) and thyronamine ( T a ) .

The word diel comes from the Latin dies day , and means a 24 - hour period . It is the greatest migration in the world in terms of biomass . This form of migration is not restricted to any one taxa as examples are known from crustaceans ( copepods ) , molluscs ( squid ) , and ray - finned fishes ( trout ) .

There are a number of potential reasons to explain the phenomenon in nature , though it is most typically to access food and avoid predators . While this mass migration is typically nocturnal , with the animals ascending from the depths at nightfall and descending at sunrise , novel types of vertical migration can occur in response to the different cues and stimuli that trigger migration . Some novel events include the absence of DVM during midnight sun in Arctic regions and the sudden onset of migration due to a solar eclipse ."},{"query":"where did the term when pigs fly come from","short_answer":"","abstract":"The phrase \`\` when pigs fly '' ( alternatively , \`\` pigs might fly '' ) is an adynaton -- a figure of speech so hyperbolic that it describes an impossibility .

It was published in six volumes . Volume I was published in 1776 and went through six printings . Volumes II and III were published in 1781 ; volumes IV , V , and VI in 1788 -- 1789 . The original volumes were published in quarto sections , a common publishing practice of the time . The work covers the history , from 98 to 1590 , of the Roman Empire , the history of early Christianity and then of the Roman State Church , and the history of Europe , and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and West . Because of its heavy use of primary sources , unusual at the time , its methodology became a model for later historians . This led to Gibbon being called the first \`\` modern historian of ancient Rome '' . His work remains a great literary achievement and a very readable introduction to the period , but considerable progress has since been made in history and archaeology , and his interpretations no longer represent current academic knowledge or thought . In The World of Late Antiquity ( 1971 ) , Peter Brown offers an alternative interpretation of the period between the second and eighth centuries AD , and Framing the Early Middle Ages ( 2005 ) by Christopher Wickham presents hitherto unavailable evidence from both documentary and archaeological sources ."},{"query":"where are the dhuli chitra paintings normally done","short_answer":"","abstract":"Pattachitra is a general term for traditional , cloth - based scroll painting , based in the eastern Indian state , Odisha .

Despite the colloquial term , barrels do not , strictly speaking , have to be shortened with a saw . Barrels can be manufactured at shorter lengths as an alternative to traditional , longer barrels . This makes them easier to transport due to their smaller profile and lighter weight . The design also makes the weapon easy to maneuver in cramped spaces , a feature sought by military close quarters combat units , law enforcement SWAT team users , and home defense purposes . With modern pump action / magazine tube shotguns , the shorter barrel limits the magazine capacity of the weapon due to the magazine tube protruding beyond the barrel . Therefore , the magazine tubes are matched in length to the barrel , which causes a reduction in the number of shells that can be held in the magazine tube ."},{"query":"the doctrine of specific nerve energies was proposed by","short_answer":"Johannes Peter Müller","abstract":"The law of specific nerve energies , first proposed by Johannes Peter Müller in 1835 , is that the nature of perception is defined by the pathway over which the sensory information is carried .

For example , pressing on the eye elicits sensations of flashes of light because the neurons in the retina send a signal to the occipital lobe . Despite the sensory input 's being mechanical , the experience is visual ."},{"query":"list of top 10 wicket takers in test cricket","short_answer":"Muttiah Muralitharan|Shane Warne|Anil Kumble|Glenn McGrath|James Anderson|Courtney Walsh|Kapil Dev|Richard Hadlee|Shaun Pollock|Dale Steyn","abstract":"Taking 300 or more wickets across a playing career is considered a significant achievement in Test cricket .
