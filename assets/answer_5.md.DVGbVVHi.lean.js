Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year .

Most species whose cells have nuclei ( eukaryotes ) are diploid , meaning they have two sets of chromosomes -- one set inherited from each parent . However , polyploidy is found in some organisms and is especially common in plants . In addition , polyploidy occurs in some tissues of animals that are otherwise diploid , such as human muscle tissues . This is known as endopolyploidy . Species whose cells do not have nuclei , that is , prokaryotes , may be polyploid , as seen in the large bacterium Epulopiscium fishelsoni . Hence ploidy is defined with respect to a cell . Most eukaryotes have diploid somatic cells , but produce haploid gametes ( eggs and sperm ) by meiosis . A monoploid has only one set of chromosomes , and the term is usually only applied to cells or organisms that are normally diploid . Male bees and other Hymenoptera , for example , are monoploid . Unlike animals , plants and multicellular algae have life cycles with two alternating multicellular generations . The gametophyte generation is haploid , and produces gametes by mitosis , the sporophyte generation is diploid and produces spores by meiosis ."},{"query":"when has congress used the power of the purse","short_answer":"","abstract":"The power of the purse is the ability of one group to manipulate and control the actions of another group by withholding funding , or putting stipulations on the use of funds .

A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves , usually circles , each representing a set . The points inside a curve labelled S represent elements of the set S , while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set S. Thus , for example , the set of all elements that are members of both sets S and T , S â© T , is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions S and T.

Most commonly the cell changes to a more specialized type . Differentiation occurs numerous times during the development of a multicellular organism as it changes from a simple zygote to a complex system of tissues and cell types . Differentiation continues in adulthood as adult stem cells divide and create fully differentiated daughter cells during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover . Some differentiation occurs in response to antigen exposure . Differentiation dramatically changes a cell 's size , shape , membrane potential , metabolic activity , and responsiveness to signals . These changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression and are the study of epigenetics . With a few exceptions , cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself .

The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex , including conquest , wars , and alliances at various points in history . The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO , the western military alliance led by the United States . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union .

For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability . For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible , the energy release ( see below ) or Q value must be positive ."},{"query":"when did the original karate kid come out","short_answer":"June 22 , 1984","abstract":"The Karate Kid is a 1984 American martial arts drama film produced by Jerry Weintraub , directed by John G.

They advanced Luther 's positions against what he saw as the abuse of the practice of clergy selling plenary indulgences , which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment for sins committed by the purchasers or their loved ones in purgatory . In the Theses , Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than merely external sacramental confession . He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin , believing that they could forgo it by purchasing an indulgence . They also , according to Luther , discouraged Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy , believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable . Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the Pope , the Theses challenge a 14th - century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins . The Theses are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther 's opinions , but Luther later clarified his views in the Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences ."},{"query":"what does the five-fold ministry mean in the bible","short_answer":"","abstract":"The fivefold ministry or five-fold ministry is a Neo-charismatic Christian belief that five offices mentioned in Ephesians ( Ephesians 4 : 11 ) , namely those of apostles , prophets , evangelists , pastors ( or \`\` shepherds '' ) and teachers , remain active and valid offices in the contemporary Christian Church ."},{"query":"who wrote the all in the family theme song","short_answer":"Lee Adams|Charles Strouse","abstract":"All in the Family is an American sitcom TV - series that was originally broadcast on the CBS television network for nine seasons , from January 1971 to April 1979 .

The vast majority of field goals , in both codes , are place kicked . Drop kicked field goals were common in the early days of Gridiron football but are almost never done in modern times . In most leagues , a successful field goal awards three points ( a notable exception is in six - man football where , due to the difficulty of making a successful field goal because of the small number of players available to stop the opposing team from attempting a block , a field goal is worth four points ) ."},{"query":"where does the pancreas secrete digestive enzymes into","short_answer":"the duodenum","abstract":"The pancreas / ËpÃ¦ÅkriÉs / is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates .

The concept of the common good differs significantly among philosophical doctrines . Early conceptions of the common good were set out by Ancient Greek philosophers , including Aristotle and Plato . One understanding of the common good rooted in Aristotle 's philosophy remains in common usage today , referring to what one contemporary scholar calls the \`\` good proper to , and attainable only by , the community , yet individually shared by its members . '' The concept of common good developed through the work of political theorists , moral philosophers , and public economists , including Thomas Aquinas , NiccolÃ² Machiavelli , John Locke , Jean - Jacques Rousseau , James Madison , Adam Smith , Karl Marx , John Stuart Mill , John Rawls , and many other thinkers . In contemporary economic theory , a common good is any good which is rivalrous yet non-excludable , while the common good , by contrast , arises in the subfield of welfare economics and refers to the outcome of a social welfare function . Such a social welfare function , in turn , would be rooted in a moral theory of the good ( such as utilitarianism ) . Social choice theory aims to understand processes by which the common good may or may not be realized in societies through the study of collective decision rules . And public choice theory applies microeconomic methodology to the study of political science in order to explain how private interests affect political activities and outcomes ."},{"query":"who won all england open championship in 2001","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"two spanish cities on the north coast of africa","short_answer":"","abstract":"Melilla ( / mÉËliËjÉ / mÉ - LEE - yÉ ; Spanish : ( meËliÊa ) , locally ( meËliÊa ) ; Arabic : ÙÙÙÙÙØ© â , Maliliyyah ; Berber languages : âµâµâµâµâµ , MÅiÄ ) is a Spanish autonomous city located on the north coast of Africa , sharing a border with Morocco , with an area of 12.3 km ( 4.7 sq mi ) .

They are tyrosine - based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism . T and T are partially composed of iodine ( see molecular model ) . A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T and T , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre . The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T ) , which has a longer half - life than T. In humans , the ratio of T to T released into the blood is sometimes claimed to be quite high , but thyroid removal patient data suggests it to vary between 4 : 1 to 2 : 1 , the average being 100 : 36 ( roughly 2.8 : 1 ) . T is converted to the active T ( three to four times more potent than T ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5 ' - iodinase ) . These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T a ) and thyronamine ( T a ) . All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium - containing enzymes , thus dietary selenium is essential for T production .

The word diel comes from the Latin dies day , and means a 24 - hour period . It is the greatest migration in the world in terms of biomass . This form of migration is not restricted to any one taxa as examples are known from crustaceans ( copepods ) , molluscs ( squid ) , and ray - finned fishes ( trout ) .

While this mass migration is typically nocturnal , with the animals ascending from the depths at nightfall and descending at sunrise , novel types of vertical migration can occur in response to the different cues and stimuli that trigger migration . Some novel events include the absence of DVM during midnight sun in Arctic regions and the sudden onset of migration due to a solar eclipse ."},{"query":"where did the term when pigs fly come from","short_answer":"","abstract":"The phrase \`\` when pigs fly '' ( alternatively , \`\` pigs might fly '' ) is an adynaton -- a figure of speech so hyperbolic that it describes an impossibility .
