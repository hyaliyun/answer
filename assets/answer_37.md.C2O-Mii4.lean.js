The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body , then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events . Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily . Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves ."},{"query":"where does the nickname bill come from william","short_answer":"","abstract":"William Sanford Nye ( born November 27 , 1955 ) , popularly known as Bill Nye the Science Guy , is an American science communicator , television presenter , and mechanical engineer .

This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese .

In human cells , both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage , resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day . Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell 's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes . Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell 's genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis . As a consequence , the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure . When normal repair processes fail , and when cellular apoptosis does not occur , irreparable DNA damage may occur , including double - strand breaks and DNA crosslinkages ( interstrand crosslinks or ICLs ) .

Most species whose cells have nuclei ( Eukaryotes ) are diploid , meaning they have two sets of chromosomes -- one set inherited from each parent . However , polyploidy is found in some organisms and is especially common in plants . In addition , polyploidy occurs in some tissues of animals that are otherwise diploid , such as human muscle tissues . This is known as endopolyploidy . Species whose cells do not have nuclei , that is , Prokaryotes , may be polyploid organisms , as seen in the large bacterium Epulopiscium fishelsoni ( 1 ) . Hence ploidy is defined with respect to a cell . Most eukaryotes have diploid somatic cells , but produce haploid gametes ( eggs and sperm ) by meiosis . A monoploid has only one set of chromosomes , and the term is usually only applied to cells or organisms that are normally diploid . Male bees and other Hymenoptera , for example , are monoploid .

Following Aristippus -- about whom very little is known -- Epicurus believed that what he called \`\` pleasure '' ( ἡδονή ) was the greatest good , but that the way to attain such pleasure was to live modestly , to gain knowledge of the workings of the world , and to limit one 's desires . This would lead one to attain a state of tranquility ( ataraxia ) and freedom from fear as well as an absence of bodily pain ( aponia ) . The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form . Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal , the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure , and its advocacy of a simple life , make it very different from \`\` hedonism '' as colloquially understood ."},{"query":"who wrote back in the new york groove","short_answer":"Russ Ballard","abstract":""},{"query":"who came up with the theory of everything","short_answer":"","abstract":"A theory of everything ( ToE ) , final theory , ultimate theory , or master theory is a hypothetical single , all - encompassing , coherent theoretical framework of physics that fully explains and links together all physical aspects of the universe .

The term ahimsa means nonviolence , non-injury or absence of desire to harm any life forms . Vegetarianism and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahimsa . The Jain concept of ahimsa is very different from the concept of nonviolence found in other philosophies . Violence is usually associated with causing harm to others . But according to the Jain philosophy , violence refers primarily to injuring one 's own self -- behaviour which inhibits the soul 's own ability to attain moksha ( liberation from the cycle of births and deaths ) . At the same time it also means violence to others because it is this tendency to harm others that ultimately harms one 's own soul . Furthermore , the Jains extend the concept of ahimsa not only to humans but to all animals , plants , micro-organisms and all beings having life or life potential . All life is sacred and everything has a right to live fearlessly to its maximum potential . Living beings need not fear those who have taken the vow of ahimsa .

If the rate of gene flow is high enough , then two populations are considered to have equivalent genetic diversity and therefore effectively a single population . It has been shown that it takes only \`\` One migrant per generation '' to prevent population diverging due to drift . Gene flow is an important mechanism for transferring genetic diversity among populations . Migrants into or out of a population may result in a change in allele frequencies ( the proportion of members carrying a particular variant of a gene ) , changing the distribution of genetic diversity within the populations . Immigration may also result in the addition of new genetic variants to the established gene pool of a particular species or population . High rates of gene flow can reduce the genetic differentiation between the two groups , increasing homogeneity . For this reason , gene flow has been thought to constrain speciation by combining the gene pools of the groups , and thus , preventing the development of differences in genetic variation that would have led to full speciation ."},{"query":"who used the cannon in the civil war","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"who edited the vanshawali of rajas of kullu princely state","short_answer":"","abstract":"Rewa State , also known as Rewah , was a princely state of India , surrounding its eponymous capital , the town of Rewa ."},{"query":"what type of college is full sail university","short_answer":"private , for - profit university","abstract":"Full Sail University is an American private , for - profit university in Winter Park , Florida .

The defining characteristic of \`\` common law '' is that it arises as precedent . In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is , a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts , and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts . If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past , the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision ( a principle known as stare decisis ) . If , however , the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases ( called a \`\` matter of first impression '' ) , and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question , judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue ( one party or the other has to win , and on disagreements of law , judges make that decision ) .

Common law , as the body of law made by judges , stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process , and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch ( the interactions are explained later in this article ) .

RNAP locally opens the double - stranded DNA ( usually about four turns of the double helix ) so that one strand of the exposed nucleotides can be used as a template for the synthesis of RNA , a process called transcription . A transcription factor and its associated transcription mediator complex must be attached to a DNA binding site called a promoter region before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position . RNAP has intrinsic helicase activity , therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind the DNA ( in contrast to DNA polymerase ) . RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription , it also guides the nucleotides into position , facilitates attachment and elongation , has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities , and termination recognition capability . In eukaryotes , RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides ."},{"query":"who plays mr bolton in high school musical","short_answer":"Barton Robert \`\` Bart '' Johnson","abstract":"Barton Robert \`\` Bart '' Johnson ( born December 13 , 1970 ) , is an American actor , best known for his role as Coach Jack Bolton in the High School Musical film series .

In such systems , while chances for third party candidates winning election to major national office are remote , it is possible for groups within the larger parties , or in opposition to one or both of them , to exert influence on the two major parties . In contrast , in the United Kingdom and Australia and in other parliamentary systems and elsewhere , the term two - party system is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties which do win seats in the legislature , and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest ."},{"query":"what were the successful characteristics of the silk road","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction originally through regions of Eurasia connecting the East and West and stretching from the Korean peninsula and Japan to the Mediterranean Sea .

After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better .
