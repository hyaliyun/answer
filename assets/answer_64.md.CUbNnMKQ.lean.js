Historians have long debated whether the evolution of tactics between 1861 and 1865 marked a seminal point in the evolution of warfare . The conventional narrative is that generals and other officers adhered stubbornly to the tactics of the Napoleonic Wars , in which armies employed linear formations and favored open fields over the usage of cover ( whether constructed or natural in origin ) . Presumably , the greater accuracy and range of the rifle musket rendered that approach obsolete , and the Civil War armies ' transition to longer battles in 1864 is taken by numerous scholars as proof of the new technology 's transformative impact . More recently , however , academics have begun to reject this narrative . Earl J. Hess judges the tactical training of the Civil War as critical to the armies ' success , and maintains that the dearth of overwhelming victories during the conflict was actually consistent with the infrequency of such battles throughout history . Allen C. Guelzo contends that rifle muskets did not revolutionize land warfare due to a combination of inadequate firearms training and the poor visibility caused by black powder . This debate has implications not only for the nature of the soldier 's experience , but also for the broader question of the Civil War 's relative modernity . Williamson Murray and Wayne Wei - Siang Hsieh argue that the conflict was resulted from \`\` the combination ... of the Industrial Revolution and French Revolution ( which ) allowed the opposing sides to mobilize immense numbers of soldiers while projecting military power over great distances .

In human cells , both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage , resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day . Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell 's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes . Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell 's genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis . As a consequence , the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure . When normal repair processes fail , and when cellular apoptosis does not occur , irreparable DNA damage may occur , including double - strand breaks and DNA crosslinkages ( interstrand crosslinks or ICLs ) .

The rate of this movement is a function of temperature , viscosity of the fluid and the size ( mass ) of the particles . Diffusion explains the net flux of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration . Once the concentrations are equal the molecules continue to move , but since there is no concentration gradient the process of molecular diffusion has ceased and is instead governed by the process of self - diffusion , originating from the random motion of the molecules . The result of diffusion is a gradual mixing of material such that the distribution of molecules is uniform . Since the molecules are still in motion , but an equilibrium has been established , the end result of molecular diffusion is called a \`\` dynamic equilibrium '' . In a phase with uniform temperature , absent external net forces acting on the particles , the diffusion process will eventually result in complete mixing ."},{"query":"who played the deaf guy in the replacements","short_answer":"David Denman","abstract":"Juilliard ( BFA ) American Conservatory Theater ( STC )"},{"query":"who won cricket match between india and bangladesh","short_answer":"India","abstract":"Sanath Jayasuriya ( 1220 ) ( ODIs )"},{"query":"who was the first to be inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , established in 1983 and located in Cleveland , Ohio , United States , is dedicated to recording the history of some of the best - known and most influential musicians , bands , producers , and others that have in some major way influenced the music industry , particularly in the area of rock and roll .

Like other power supplies , an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source ( often mains power ) to DC loads , such as a personal computer , while converting voltage and current characteristics . Unlike a linear power supply , the pass transistor of a switching - mode supply continually switches between low - dissipation , full - on and full - off states , and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions , which minimizes wasted energy . Ideally , a switched - mode power supply dissipates no power . Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on - to - off time . In contrast , a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor . This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched - mode power supply . Switched - mode power supplies may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight ."},{"query":"when is a place to call home series 3 back on bbc2","short_answer":"on 25 February 2016","abstract":""},{"query":"when was the last time the saints made the playoffs","short_answer":"","abstract":"The New Orleans Saints have appeared in 16 different postseason games and have compiled a record of 7 - 9 ( as of January , 2014 ) .

During times of stress , the body reacts by secreting stress hormones into the bloodstream . Stress can cause acute and chronic changes in certain brain areas which can cause long - term damage . Over-secretion of stress hormones most frequently impairs long - term delayed recall memory , but can enhance short - term , immediate recall memory . This enhancement is particularly relative in emotional memory . In particular , the hippocampus , prefrontal cortex and the amygdala are affected . One class of stress hormone responsible for negatively affecting long - term , delayed recall memory is the glucocorticoids ( GCs ) , the most notable of which is cortisol . Glucocorticoids facilitate and impair the actions of stress in the brain memory process . Cortisol is a known biomarker for stress . Under normal circumstances , the hippocampus regulates the production of cortisol through negative feedback because it has many receptors that are sensitive to these stress hormones . However , an excess of cortisol can impair the ability of the hippocampus to both encode and recall memories . These stress hormones are also hindering the hippocampus from receiving enough energy by diverting glucose levels to surrounding muscles ."},{"query":"erikson's second stage of personality development is referred to as","short_answer":"","abstract":"Erikson 's stages of psychosocial development , as articulated by Erik Erikson , in collaboration with Joan Erikson , is a comprehensive psychoanalytic theory that identifies a series of eight stages , in which a healthy developing individual should pass through from infancy to late adulthood .

The work covers the history , from 98 to 1590 , of the Roman Empire , the history of early Christianity and then of the Roman State Church , and the history of Europe , and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and West .

If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past , the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision ( a principle known as stare decisis ) .

The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen , called an antigen , via the Fab 's variable region . Each tip of the \`\` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly , analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision . Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by inhibiting a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) . Depending on the antigen , the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance . The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region ( located at the base of the \`\` Y '' ) , which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions . The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system ."},{"query":"what is the role of mid ocean ridge in the movement of lithospheric plates","short_answer":"","abstract":"A mid-ocean ridge is an underwater mountain system formed by plate tectonics .

In human cells , both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage , resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day . Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell 's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes . Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell 's genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis . As a consequence , the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure .

This increase in membrane potential is what causes the cell membrane , which typically maintains a resting membrane potential of - 70 mV , to reach the threshold potential and consequently fire the next action potential ; thus , the pacemaker potential is what drives the self - generated rhythmic firing ( automaticity ) of pacemaker cells , and the rate of change ( i.e. , the slope ) of the pacemaker potential is what determines the timing of the next action potential and thus the intrinsic firing rate of the cell . In a healthy sinoatrial node ( SAN , a complex tissue within the right atrium containing pacemaker cells that normally determine the intrinsic firing rate for the entire heart ) , the pacemaker potential is the main determinant of the heart rate . Because the pacemaker potential represents the non-contracting time between heart beats ( diastole ) , it is also called the diastolic depolarization . The amount of net inward current required to move the cell membrane potential during the pacemaker phase is extremely small , in the order of few pAs , but this net flux arises from time to time changing contribution of several currents that flow with different voltage and time dependence . Evidence in support of the active presence of K , Ca , Na channels and Na / K exchanger during the pacemaker phase have been variously reported in the literature , but several indications point to the \`\` funny '' ( I ) current as one of the most important. ( see funny current ) . There is now substantial evidence that also sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) Ca - transients participate to the generation of the diastolic depolarization via a process involving the Na -- Ca exchanger ."},{"query":"wwe randy orton wins world heavyweight championship first time","short_answer":"","abstract":"Randal Keith Orton ( born April 1 , 1980 ) is an American professional wrestler and actor .

The impetus for drafting an amendment to lower the voting age arose following the Supreme Court 's decision in Oregon v.
