This effect arises from the gravitational gradient ( tidal force ) between the co-orbiting bodies , acting over a sufficiently long period of time . Once tidal locking is achieved for one of the bodies , there is no more net transfer of angular momentum between the two objects , although there can be some back and forth transfer over the course of an orbit . In the special case where the orbital eccentricity is nearly zero , tidal locking results in one hemisphere of the revolving object constantly facing its partner , an effect known as synchronous rotation . For example , the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth , although there is some libration because the Moon 's orbit is not perfectly circular . A tidally locked body in synchronous rotation takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner ."},{"query":"where will the 2024 world cup be held","short_answer":"","abstract":"The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the 23rd FIFA World Cup , the quadrennial international men 's football championship contested by the national teams of the member associations of FIFA ."},{"query":"who played the little girl in all in the family","short_answer":"Stephanie Mills","abstract":"Stephanie Mills ( born around 1969 ) was a character on the 1970s American television situation comedy All in the Family and the follow - up series , Archie Bunker 's Place .

The central nervous system is so named because it integrates information it receives from , and coordinates and influences the activity of , all parts of the bodies of bilaterally symmetric animals -- that is , all multicellular animals except sponges and radially symmetric animals such as jellyfish -- and it contains the majority of the nervous system . Many consider the retina and the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , as well as the olfactory nerves ( cranial nerve I ) and olfactory epithelium as parts of the CNS , synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia . As such , the olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the environment , which opens up for therapeutic treatments . The CNS is contained within the dorsal body cavity , with the brain housed in the cranial cavity and the spinal cord in the spinal canal . In vertebrates , the brain is protected by the skull , while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae . The brain and spinal cord are both enclosed in the meninges .

The theory , developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism , is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will ; an action can only be good if its maxim -- the principle behind it -- is duty to the moral law . Central to Kant 's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative , which acts on all people , regardless of their interests or desires . Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways . His principle of universalizability requires that , for an action to be permissible , it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring . If a contradiction occurs the act violates Aristotle 's \`\` Non-contradiction '' concept which states that just actions can not lead to contradictions . Kant 's formulation of humanity , the second section of the Categorical Imperative , states that as an end in itself humans are required never to treat others merely as a means to an end , but always , additionally , as ends in themselves . The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will , while Kant 's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom . Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties . A perfect duty , such as the duty not to lie , always holds true ; an imperfect duty , such as the duty to give to charity , can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place ."},{"query":"what is the name of volcano in india","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of Quaternary active , dormant / extinct volcanoes in India ."},{"query":"the hepburn act of 1906 brought significant changes in which of the following industries","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was the first of a series of significant consumer protection laws which was enacted by Congress in the 20th century and led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration .

An external force makes parts of the crystal lattice glide along each other , changing the material 's geometry . Depending on the type of lattice , different slip systems are present in the material . More specifically , slip occurs on close - packed planes ( those containing the greatest number of atoms per area ) , and in close - packed directions ( most atoms per length ) . The magnitude and direction of slip are represented by the Burgers vector . The picture on the right shows a schematic view of the slip mechanism . The slip planes and slip directions in a crystal have specific crystallographic forms . The slip planes are normally the planes with the highest density of atoms , i.e. , those most closely spaced , and the direction of the slip is the direction in the slip plane that corresponds to one of the shortest lattice translation vectors . Often , this is the direction in which atoms are most closely spaced . A slip plane and a slip direction constitute a slip system . A critical resolved shear stress is required to initiate a slip . Slip is an important mode of deformation mechanism in crystals . For metals and technically used metallic alloys it is by far the most important deformation mechanism and subject to current research in materials science ."},{"query":"what was the focus of greek art during the archaic period","short_answer":"","abstract":"Ancient Greek art stands out among that of other ancient cultures for its development of naturalistic but idealized depictions of the human body , in which largely nude male figures were generally the focus of innovation .

Greek architecture , technically very simple , established a harmonious style with numerous detailed conventions that were largely adopted by Roman architecture and are still followed in some modern buildings . It used a vocabulary of ornament that was shared with pottery , metalwork and other media , and had an enormous influence on Eurasian art , especially after Buddhism carried it beyond the expanded Greek world created by Alexander the Great .

CDR is a different approach than removing CO from the stack emissions of large fossil fuel point sources , such as power stations . The latter reduces emission to the atmosphere but can not reduce the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere . As CDR removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , it creates negative emissions , offsetting emissions from small and dispersed point sources such as domestic heating systems , airplanes and vehicle exhausts . It is regarded by some as a form of climate engineering , while other commentators describe it as a form of carbon capture and storage or extreme mitigation . Whether CDR would satisfy common definitions of \`\` climate engineering '' or \`\` geoengineering '' usually depends upon the scale on which it would be undertaken ."},{"query":"who killed adam susan in v for vendetta","short_answer":"Rosemary Almond","abstract":"Adam James Susan is a fictional character and the main antagonist of the comic book series ( later graphic novel ) V for Vendetta , created by writer Alan Moore and illustrator David Lloyd .

If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past , the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision ( a principle known as stare decisis ) . If , however , the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases ( called a \`\` matter of first impression '' ) , and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question , judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue ( one party or the other has to win , and on disagreements of law , judges make that decision ) . The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision , and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants . Common law , as the body of law made by judges , stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process , and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch ( the interactions are explained later in this article ) .

The earliest , widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products , also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology . A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative , which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers . This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum - realm scale , and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold . It is therefore common to see the plural form \`\` nanotechnologies '' as well as \`\` nanoscale technologies '' to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size . Because of the variety of potential applications ( including industrial and military ) , governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research .

For instance , chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when a stick of dynamite explodes . If one adds up all the forms of energy that were released in the explosion , such as the kinetic energy of the pieces , as well as heat and sound , one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite . Classically , conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass ; however , special relativity showed that mass could be converted to energy and vice versa by E = mc , and science now takes the view that mass -- energy is conserved ."},{"query":"is there a noble my love season 2","short_answer":"","abstract":"Noble , My Love ( Hangul 고결한 그대 ) is a 2015 South Korean web drama starring Sung Hoon and Kim Jae - kyung .

A men 's basketball tournament was first held at the 1904 Olympics as a demonstration ; it has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1936 . In the 1972 Olympics , the final game between the United States and the Soviet Union was a controversial one , as the game was ended and replayed twice by a FIBA ( International Basketball Federation ) official without the authority to do so , before the Soviet Union won their first gold medal , which would have been won by the United States if the game was not started against the rules . The U.S. filed a formal protest but was rejected by FIBA . As a result , the United States refused to accept the silver medal , and no player has ever claimed his medal . After a protest of the Soviet -- Afghan War , the United States boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics . The Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics boycott in response . Both boycotts affected basketball at the Olympics , as both had successful basketball teams at the time . The advent of the state - sponsored \`\` full - time amateur athlete '' of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur , as it put the self - financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage . The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students , soldiers , or working in a profession , but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full - time basis . In April 1989 , through the leadership of Secretary General Borislav Stanković , FIBA approved the rule that allowed NBA players to compete in international tournaments , including the Olympics . In the next Olympics , the 1992 Summer Olympics , the \`\` Dream Team '' won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics Basketball , with an average winning margin of 44 points per game , and without calling a time out . By this time , the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia no longer existed , but their successor states continued to be among the leading forces .

The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system . The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits . When the set pressure is exceeded , the relief valve becomes the \`\` path of least resistance '' as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route . The diverted fluid ( liquid , gas or liquid -- gas mixture ) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central , elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere . As the fluid is diverted , the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising . Once it reaches the valve 's reseating pressure , the valve will close . The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats . The blowdown can vary from roughly 2 -- 20 % , and some valves have adjustable blowdowns ."},{"query":"8ball and mjg on top of the world album","short_answer":"","abstract":"On Top of the World is the third studio album by American hip hop duo Eightball & MJG .

Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves . The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American Civil War . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States . These periods of prison construction and reform produced major changes in the structure of prison systems and their missions , the responsibilities of federal and state agencies for administering and supervising them , as well as the legal and political status of prisoners themselves ."},{"query":"are you supposed to watch the hobbit before lord of the rings","short_answer":"","abstract":"Middle - earth is the fictional setting of much of British writer J.R.R.
