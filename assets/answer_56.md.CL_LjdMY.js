A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary , a crustal extension , a spreading apart of the surface , which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion . When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart , a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks , forming a graben . The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new . That feature is the beginning of the rift valley , but as the process continues , the valley widens , until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area . One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift . On Earth , rifts can occur at all elevations , from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust . They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys , which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically ."},{"query":"where was the merlot wine grape originally grown","short_answer":"thought to have originated on one of the islands found along the Garonne river","abstract":"Merlot is a dark blue - colored wine grape variety , that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines .

Management by objectives is the process of defining specific objectives within an organization that management can convey to organization members , then deciding on how to achieve each objective in sequence . This process allows managers to take work that needs to be done one step at a time to allow for a calm , yet productive work environment . This process also helps organization members to see their accomplishments as they achieve each objective , which reinforces a positive work environment and a sense of achievement . An important part of MBO is the measurement and comparison of an employee 's actual performance with the standards set . Ideally , when employees themselves have been involved with the goal - setting and choosing the course of action to be followed by them , they are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities . According to George S. Odiorne , the system of management by objectives can be described as a process whereby the superior and subordinate jointly identify common goals , define each individual 's major areas of responsibility in terms of the results expected of him or her , and use these measures as guides for operating the unit and assessing the contribution of each of its members ."},{"query":"where does the name latin america come from","short_answer":"","abstract":"Mainly : Spanish , Portuguese and French"},{"query":"who becomes badnaam for her darling according to the song in dabangg","short_answer":"Malaika Arora","abstract":"Dabangg ( English : Fearless ) is a 2010 Indian action film directed by Abhinav Kashyap , and produced by Arbaaz Khan under Arbaaz Khan Productions .

In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body .

Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily .

This means a good 's demand is increased when the price of another goods is decreased . Conversely , the demand for a goods is decreased when the price of another goods is increased . If goods A and B are complements , an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in ; less of each goods will be demanded . A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward ; more of each goods will be demanded . Basically this means that since the demand of one goods is linked to the demand of another goods , if a higher quantity is demanded of one goods , a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other , and if a lower quantity is demanded of one goods , a lower quantity will be demanded of the other . The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way : if the price of one goods rises , so will the price of the other , and vice versa . With substitute goods , however , the price and quantity demanded of one goods is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a substitute goods , meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one goods rises , the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall ."},{"query":"who is mulder's father on the x files","short_answer":"The Smoking Man","abstract":"FBI Special Agent Fox William Mulder ( / ˈmʌldər / ) is a fictional character in the Fox science fiction - supernatural television series The X-Files , played by David Duchovny .

The main function of the SR is to store calcium ions ( Ca ) . Calcium ion levels are kept relatively constant , with the concentration of calcium ions within a cell being 100,000 times smaller than the concentration of calcium ions outside the cell . This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes ( the calcium is said to be a second messenger ; see calcium in biology for more details ) . Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate ( found in chalk ) and calcium phosphate , two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones . This means that too much calcium within the cells can lead to hardening ( calcification ) of certain intracellular structures , including the mitochondria , leading to cell death . Therefore , it is vital that calcium ion levels are controlled tightly , and can be released into the cell when necessary and then removed from the cell ."},{"query":"who won the first super bowl in 1967","short_answer":"Green Bay Packers","abstract":"The first AFL - NFL World Championship Game in professional American football , known retroactively as Super Bowl I and referred to in some contemporaneous reports , including the game 's radio broadcast , as the Super Bowl , was played on January 15 , 1967 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles , California .

LUCA is the most recent common ancestor of all current life on Earth . LUCA should not be assumed to be the first living organism on Earth . The LUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago ( sometime in the Paleoarchean era ) . The composition of the LUCA is not directly accessible as a fossil , but can be studied by comparing the genomes of its descendants , organisms living today . By this means , a 2016 study identified a set of 355 genes inferred to have been present in the LUCA . This would imply it was already a complex life form with many co-adapted features including transcription and translation mechanisms to convert information between DNA , RNA , and proteins . Some of those genes , however , could have been acquired later by horizontal gene transfer between archaea and bacteria ."},{"query":"who played the butler in hart to hart","short_answer":"","abstract":"Lionel Jay Stander ( January 11 , 1908 -- November 30 , 1994 ) was an American actor in films , radio , theater and television ."},{"query":"who did charlie puth write see you again for","short_answer":"Vail Cerullo , a friend of Puth 's time at Berklee College of Music , who perished in a motorcycle accident in 2012","abstract":"\`\` See You Again '' is a song recorded by American rapper Wiz Khalifa , featuring American singer Charlie Puth .

However , opera is musical theatre , while oratorio is strictly a concert piece -- though oratorios are sometimes staged as operas , and operas are sometimes presented in concert form .

The nucleosynthesis , or fusion of lighter elements into heavier ones , occurs during explosive oxygen burning and silicon burning processes . Those fusion reactions create the elements silicon , sulfur , chlorine , argon , sodium , potassium , calcium , scandium , titanium and iron peak elements : vanadium , chromium , manganese , iron , cobalt , and nickel . These are called \`\` primary elements '' , in that they can be fused from pure hydrogen and helium in massive stars . As a result of their ejection from supernovae , their abundances increase within the interstellar medium . Elements heavier than nickel are created primarily by a rapid capture of neutrons in a process called the r - process . However , these are much less abundant than the primary chemical elements . Other processes are thought to be responsible for some nucleosynthesis of other such heavy elements , notably , the proton capture process known as the rp - process and a photodisintegration process known as the gamma ( or p ) process . The latter synthesizes the lightest , most neutron - poor , isotopes of the heavy elements ."},{"query":"1 cup is equal to how many glass","short_answer":"","abstract":"The cup is a United States unit of volume , most commonly associated with cooking and serving sizes .

RNAP locally opens the double - stranded DNA ( usually about four turns of the double helix ) so that one strand of the exposed nucleotides can be used as a template for the synthesis of RNA , a process called transcription . A transcription factor and its associated transcription mediator complex must be attached to a DNA binding site called a promoter region before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position . RNAP has intrinsic helicase activity , therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind the DNA ( in contrast to DNA polymerase ) . RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription , it also guides the nucleotides into position , facilitates attachment and elongation , has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities , and termination recognition capability . In eukaryotes , RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides ."},{"query":"what is the role of hcl in your stomach","short_answer":"digestion of proteins , by activating digestive enzymes , and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids","abstract":"Gastric acid , gastric juice or stomach acid , is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach and is composed of hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) , potassium chloride ( KCl ) and sodium chloride ( NaCl ) .

Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach , which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed . Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate , a base , to buffer the fluid , ensuring that it does not become too acidic . These cells also produce mucus , which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach .

Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs , Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 . This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom , and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Canada 's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act , subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom ."},{"query":"who has conducted the study of the institution of ghotul of the tribes of chhattisgarh","short_answer":"","abstract":"A ghotul is a spacious tribal hut surrounded by earthen or wooden walls .

The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex , including conquest , wars , and alliances at various points in history . The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union .

Also called Darwinian theory , it originally included the broad concepts of transmutation of species or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859 , including concepts which predated Darwin 's theories . It subsequently referred to the specific concepts of natural selection , the Weismann barrier , or the central dogma of molecular biology . Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution , creationists have appropriated it to refer to the origin of life , and it has even been applied to concepts of cosmic evolution , both of which have no connection to Darwin 's work . It is therefore considered the belief and acceptance of Darwin 's and of his predecessors ' work -- in place of other theories , including divine design and extraterrestrial origins ."},{"query":"where is an eye for an eye found in the bible","short_answer":"Exodus|Leviticus|Deuteronomy","abstract":"\`\` Only one eye for one eye '' , also known as \`\` An eye for an eye '' or \`\` A tooth for a tooth '' ) , or the law of retaliation , is the principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree , and the person inflicting such punishment should be the injured party .

The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex , including conquest , wars , and alliances at various points in history . The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union . The British press relishes the chance to refer to France and Britain as \`\` historic rivals '' or emphasize the perceived ever - lasting competition that still opposes the two countries ."},{"query":"who sings can't get enough of your love babe","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Ca n't Get Enough of Your Love , Babe '' is a song written , recorded , and produced by Barry White .
