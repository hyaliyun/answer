At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action . The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era .

Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support . South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union .

For both economic and political reasons , the U.S. government generally supported those who occupied the seats of power , whether they held that power legitimately or not . A clear exception was the French Intervention in Mexico , when the U.S. supported the beleaguered liberal government of Benito Juárez at the time of the American Civil War ( 1861 - 1865 ) . Prior to Woodrow Wilson 's inauguration on March 4 , 1913 , the U.S. Government focused on just warning the Mexican military that decisive action from the U.S. military would take place if lives and property of U.S. nationals living in the country were endangered . President William Howard Taft sent more troops to the US - Mexico border but did not allow them to intervene in the conflict , a move which Congress opposed . Twice during the Revolution , the U.S. sent troops into Mexico . la The U.S. recognized the government of Porfirio Díaz in 1878 , two years after Díaz 's coup d'état brought him to power . Díaz 's long rule of Mexico brought close economic cooperation between the two countries , especially since Díaz imposed political order that allowed business to flourish . In 1908 , however , Díaz gave an interview to a U.S. journalist , James Creelman , in which Díaz stated he would not run for re-election in 1910 ; the statement gave rise to politicking of potential candidates . Díaz reversed himself , ran for re-election , and jailed the leading opposition candidate , Francisco I. Madero . Mexican revolutionaries prior to the 1910 events had sought refuge on the U.S. side of the border , a pattern Madero continued . He escaped Mexico and took refuge in San Antonio , Texas and called for nullification of the 1910 elections , himself as provisional president , and revolutionary support from the Mexican people . His Plan of San Luis Potosí did spark revolutionary uprisings , particularly in Mexico 's north . The U.S. stayed out of the unfolding events until March 6 , 1911 , when President William Howard Taft mobilized forces on the U.S. - Mexico border . \`\` In effect this was an intervention in Mexican politics , and to Mexicans it meant the United States had condemned Díaz ."},{"query":"when did the union jack become the union flag","short_answer":"1801","abstract":"The Union Jack , or Union Flag , is the national flag of the United Kingdom .

Only home runs hit in a particular league count towards that league 's seasonal lead . Mark McGwire , for example , hit 58 home runs in 1997 , more than any other player that year . However , McGwire was traded from the American League 's ( AL ) Oakland Athletics to the National League 's ( NL ) St. Louis Cardinals midway through the season and his individual AL and NL home run totals ( 34 and 24 , respectively ) did not qualify to lead either league ."},{"query":"who helped to make adolescence a separate developmental stage","short_answer":"","abstract":"Adolescence ( from Latin adolescere , meaning ' to grow up ' ) is a transitional stage of physical and psychological development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood ( age of majority ) .

The model 's key success lay in explaining the Rydberg formula for the spectral emission lines of atomic hydrogen .

The song tells the story of an old woman who swallowed increasingly large animals , each to catch the previously swallowed animal . There are many variations of phrasing in the lyrics , especially for the description of swallowing each animal . The spider and fly are described in each verse , but the other animals are only described when they are introduced starting with the bird . The absurdity stems from the increasingly improbable solutions that only worsen the initial problem and are more likely to cause the woman 's death : the logic of swallowing of even more animals of preposterous sizes without dying , contrasted with the expected , matter - of - fact recounting of her death from swallowing an animal larger than herself , when in fact the swallowing of any animal as a solution was absurd . This song for children appeals to their initial logic that a fly can be swallowed by an old lady . A spider would also be seen as logical and physically possible . As you get to the bird , it slowly becomes clear for the child that it 's part of an imaginary scenario leading to a whole horse being swallowed .

The film recounts the 1952 expedition , initially by motorcycle , across South America by Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado . As well as being a road movie , the film is a coming - of - age film ; as the adventure , initially centered on youthful hedonism , unfolds , Guevara discovers himself transformed by his observations on the life of the impoverished indigenous peasantry . Through the characters they encounter on their continental trek , Guevara and Granado witness firsthand the injustices that the destitute face and are exposed to people and social classes they would have never encountered otherwise . To their surprise , the road presents to them both a genuine and captivating picture of Latin American identity .

White light from the sun is made up of a combination of colors , which are broken apart by water droplets in a ' rainbow ' spectrum . Large quantities of water , even in a swimming pool , would appear blue as well . When light hits the water surface , the different colors are absorbed , transmitted , scattered , or reflected in differing intensities by water molecules and other so - called optically - active constituents in suspension in the upper layer of the ocean . The reason open ocean waters often appear blue is due to the absorption and scattering of light . The blue wavelengths of light are scattered , similar to the scattering of blue light in the sky but absorption is a much larger factor than scattering for the clear ocean water . In water , absorption is strong in the red and weak in the blue , thus red light is absorbed quickly in the ocean leaving blue . Almost all sunlight that enters the ocean is absorbed , except very close to the coast . The red , yellow , and green wavelengths of sunlight are absorbed by water molecules in the ocean . When sunlight hits the ocean , some of the light is reflected back directly but most of it penetrates the ocean surface and interacts with the water molecules that it encounters . The red , orange , yellow , and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so that the remaining light we see is composed of the shorter wavelength blues and violets ."},{"query":"how many survivors were there when the titanic sank","short_answer":"710","abstract":"Coordinates : 41 ° 43 ′ 55 '' N 49 ° 56 ′ 45 '' W \uFEFF / \uFEFF 41.73194 ° N 49.94583 ° W \uFEFF / 41.73194 ; - 49.94583"},{"query":"actor that plays jon snow in game of thrones","short_answer":"","abstract":"Christopher Catesby \`\` Kit '' Harington ( born 26 December 1986 ) is an English actor and producer .

Unlike a direct free kick , a goal may not be scored directly from the kick ; the ball must first come into contact with another player ( from either team ) . If the ball goes into the goal without touching any other player , a goal kick is awarded . The law was derived from the Sheffield Rules that stated that no goal could be scored from a free kick . This law was absorbed into the Laws of the Game in 1877 and later adapted to allow indirect free kicks as a result of dangerous play . An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team when a player infringes certain technical requirements of the laws ( e.g. touching the ball a second time following a restart , or the keeper touching the ball with his hands when a teammate has used his foot to pass it back to the keeper ) . An indirect free kick is also awarded to the opposing team when play is stopped to caution or send - off a player when no specific foul has occurred ( e.g. when play is stopped to caution a player for dissenting the decision of the referee ) .

The defining characteristic of \`\` common law '' is that it arises as precedent . In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is , a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts , and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts . If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past , the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision ( a principle known as stare decisis ) . If , however , the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases ( called a \`\` matter of first impression '' ) , and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question , judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue ( one party or the other has to win , and on disagreements of law , judges make that decision ) .

For example , it is possible that variations in six observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved ( underlying ) variables . Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables . The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors , plus \`\` error '' terms . Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables . The theory behind factor analytic methods is that the information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset . Factor analysis is commonly used in biology , psychometrics , personality theories , marketing , product management , operations research , and finance . Proponents of factor analysis believe that it helps to deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying / latent variables . It is one of the most commonly used inter-dependency techniques and is used when the relevant set of variables shows a systematic inter-dependence and the objective is to find out the latent factors that create a commonality ."},{"query":"where are the tolls located on beltway 8","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"the longest flight in history... in a cessna-172","short_answer":"","abstract":"The flight endurance record is the longest amount of time an aircraft of a particular category spent in flight without landing .

If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle , the wave can not pass through and is entirely reflected . The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs . This is particularly common as an optical phenomenon , where light waves are involved , but it occurs with many types of waves , such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves . When a wave reaches a boundary between different materials with different refractive indices , the wave will in general be partially refracted at the boundary surface , and partially reflected . However , if the angle of incidence is greater ( i.e. the direction of propagation is closer to being parallel to the boundary ) than the critical angle -- the angle of incidence at which light is refracted such that it travels along the boundary -- then the wave will not cross the boundary , but will instead be totally reflected back internally . This can only occur when the wave in a medium with a higher refractive index ( n ) reaches a boundary with a medium of lower refractive index ( n ) . For example , it will occur with light reaching air from glass , but not when reaching glass from air ."},{"query":"when does the five nights at freddy's movie come out","short_answer":"","abstract":"Five Nights at Freddy 's ( often abbreviated to FNaF ) is a media franchise based around an indie video game series created , designed , developed , and published by Scott Cawthon for Microsoft Windows , iOS , and Android ."},{"query":"who played milburn drysdale on the beverly hillbillies","short_answer":"Raymond Thomas Bailey","abstract":"Raymond Thomas Bailey ( May 6 , 1904 -- April 15 , 1980 ) was an American actor on the Broadway stage , films , and television .

Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active site or to the allosteric site on a receptor , or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor 's activity . Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonist -- receptor complex , which , in turn , depends on the nature of antagonist -- receptor binding . The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors ."},{"query":"when was the last time the milwaukee brewers won the world series","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"pokemon hoopa and the clash of ages wiki","short_answer":"","abstract":"¥ 2.61 billion"},{"query":"who is the main actor in the show arrow","short_answer":"Stephen Amell","abstract":"Arrow is an American television series developed by Greg Berlanti , Marc Guggenheim , and Andrew Kreisberg , based on the DC Comics character Green Arrow .

Proteins are polymers -- specifically polypeptides -- formed from sequences of amino acids , the monomers of the polymer . A single amino acid monomer may also be called a residue indicating a repeating unit of a polymer . Proteins form by amino acids undergoing condensation reactions , in which the amino acids lose one water molecule per reaction in order to attach to one another with a peptide bond . By convention , a chain under 30 amino acids is often identified as a peptide , rather than a protein . To be able to perform their biological function , proteins fold into one or more specific spatial conformations driven by a number of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding , ionic interactions , Van der Waals forces , and hydrophobic packing . To understand the functions of proteins at a molecular level , it is often necessary to determine their three - dimensional structure . This is the topic of the scientific field of structural biology , which employs techniques such as X-ray crystallography , NMR spectroscopy , and dual polarisation interferometry to determine the structure of proteins ."},{"query":"which leader shut down the parliament and suspended the constitution in the ottoman empire","short_answer":"Abdul Hamid II","abstract":"Abdul Hamid II ( Ottoman Turkish : عبد الحميد ثانی ‎ , \` Abdü'l - Ḥamīd - i sânî ; Turkish : İkinci Abdülhamit ; 21 September 1842 -- 10 February 1918 ) was the 34th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and the last Sultan to exert effective control over the fracturing state .

The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec , which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas . With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada . Later , with Confederation in 1867 , the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada , which was subsequently divided into four provinces , Ontario , Quebec , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia . A number of other British colonies , such as Newfoundland and British Columbia , and large territories such as Rupert 's Land initially remained outside the newly formed federation . Over time , the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949 . Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs , Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 . This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom , and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom .

If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle , the wave can not pass through and is entirely reflected . The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs . This is particularly common as an optical phenomenon , where light waves are involved , but it occurs with many types of waves , such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves . When a wave reaches a boundary between different materials with different refractive indices , the wave will in general be partially refracted at the boundary surface , and partially reflected . However , if the angle of incidence is greater ( i.e. the direction of propagation is closer to being parallel to the boundary ) than the critical angle -- the angle of incidence at which light is refracted such that it travels along the boundary -- then the wave will not cross the boundary , but will instead be totally reflected back internally . This can only occur when the wave in a medium with a higher refractive index ( n ) reaches a boundary with a medium of lower refractive index ( n ) . For example , it will occur with light reaching air from glass , but not when reaching glass from air ."},{"query":"usama ibn munqidh the book of contemplation summary","short_answer":"","abstract":"Majd ad - Dīn Usāma ibn Murshid ibn ʿAlī ibn Munqidh al - Kināni al - Kalbi ( also Usamah , Ousama , etc. ; Arabic : أسامة بن منقذ ‎ ) ( July 4 , 1095 -- November 17 , 1188 ) was a medieval Muslim poet , author , faris ( knight ) , and diplomat from the Banu Munqidh dynasty of Shaizar in northern Syria .
