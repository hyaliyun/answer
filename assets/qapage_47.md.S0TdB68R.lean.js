The regular season typically runs from early April to late September, followed by the postseason in October. The season begins with the official Opening Day and runs 26 weeks through the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October. One or more International Opener games may be scheduled outside the United States before the official Opening Day.[1] It is possible for a given team to play a maximum of 20 games in the postseason in a given year, provided the team is a wild card and advances to each of the Division Series, Championship Series, and World Series with each series going the distance (5 games in the Division Series, 7 games in the League Championship Series/World Series).\\r\\nThe regular season is constructed from series. Due to travel concerns and the sheer number of games, pairs of teams are never scheduled to play single games against each other (except in the instance of making up a postponed game); instead they play games on several consecutive days in the same ballpark. Most often the series are of three or four games, but two-game series are also scheduled. With only one exception, teams play one mid-week series and one weekend series per week for a total of 52 series per year (24 divisional series, 20 inter-divisional series, 8 inter-league series). Depending on the length of the series, mid-week series games are usually scheduled between Monday and Thursday, while weekend games are scheduled between Thursday and Monday. Due to the mid-week all-star break in July, teams are scheduled to play two two-game series between Monday and Thursday of another week, called a four-game \\"split\\" series, with two games in one team's ballpark, then two games in the other's to complete the 52-series schedule. A team's road games are usually grouped into a multi-series road trip; home series are grouped into homestands.\\r\\nNote that rainouts and other cancellations are often rescheduled ad hoc during the season, sometimes as doubleheaders. However, if two teams are scheduled to meet for the final time in the last two weeks of the season, and the game is cancelled, it may not be rescheduled if there's no impact on the divisional or wild card races. For example, in 2016, the September 29 game between the Cleveland Indians and Detroit Tigers was cancelled due to rain because the teams were unable to reschedule a make-up date before the end of the season on October 2, and it didn't affect the divisional race. In contrast, a 2008 AL Central division game between Detroit and the Chicago White Sox needed to be made up following the last day of the regular season because it affected a division race involving the White Sox and the Minnesota Twins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis account gives the length of the major league \\"championship season\\" schedule by league and year. It does not cover the curtailment of play by war (1918) or by strikes and lockouts (1972, 1981, 1994). The schedules for 1995 were revised and shortened from 162 to 144 games, after late resolution of the strike that had begun in 1994 required a delay in the season to accommodate limited spring training.\\r\\nThe listed years are those in which the league revised its schedule. For example, the National League (NL) scheduled 84 games during 1879, 1880, 1881, and 1882 ÿ that is, four seasons from 1879, ending before 1883, the next listing. 1876 is listed here for convenience although the NL did not schedule games (see 1871 to 1876, below).\\r\\n1882 ÿ 1891\\r\\nThus the AA expanded its schedule to 140 games two years before the National League did so. After 1891 four AA clubs joined the NL and four were bought out, nominally creating one big league, the \\"National League and American Association\\" of 12 clubs.\\r\\n1884\\r\\n1890\\r\\n1914: 1915\\r\\nThe National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (1871ÿ1875) did not schedule games, nor did it control the number of teams, a major reason for its demise after the 1875 season. Clubs paid a $10 entry fee, later $20, to enter the Association for one season, and thereby declare for that year's national championship. Without continuing membership or heavy investment, there was little to deter a team from breaking a commitment, and though it happened, it was mainly due to clubs going out of business.\\r\\nThe National League organized for 1876 on a different basis, granting exclusive memberships to eight clubs that would continue from year to year  it was generally expected, if only because membership would be profitable. But the new league followed its predecessor in merely agreeing that each club would play a certain number of matches to a decision (excluding ties) by a certain date. Boston played 70 games with its quota of ten decisions against every rival. The others achieved 56 to 68 decisions, 64 to 66 for the four western teams as the teams from New York and Philadelphia (eastern) abandoned their schedule-concluding road trips.\\r\\nFor all six early seasons, prior to the first league schedule in 1877, member clubs scheduled their own matches by mutual arrangement, including championship games necessarily with member clubs, other games with members, and games with non-member clubs. Some may have practically dictated their arrangements with some others, but there was no central control or coordination.\\r\\nThis listing gives the greatest number of games played by any club for each season. Naturally, the leader by games played was always a strong club fielding one of the better gate attractions.\\r\\nThe leading numbers of games played to a decision were 33, 54, 59, 71, 82, and 70 decisions; by the listed teams except the Mutuals in 1872.\\r\\nSince 1998, there have been 30 major league teams with a single advance schedule for every season that comprises 2430 games. Each team plays 162 games, 81 as the \\"home\\" team, 81 as the \\"visitor\\". (This is true even on the rare occasion when a game is played at a ballpark not home to either team.) Occasionally, the advance schedule is subsequently altered due to a game postponement or a one-game tie-breaker to determine which team will play in the postseason.\\r\\nBefore 2013 the schedule included 252 \\"interleague games\\" that matched one team from the American League and one from the National League; the other 2178 games matched a pair from within one league. About half of the latter matched teams from within one division and about half matched teams from different divisions in one league. In the Central Division of the National League, which alone had six teams, every pair of division rivals played 15 or 16 games. Within the other, smaller divisions every pair of teams played 18 or 19 games.\\r\\nDivision games (1091). There are 61 pairs of teams from within one division.\\r\\nOther intraleague games (1087). There are 150 pairs of teams from two different divisions within one league.\\r\\nThe schedule for interleague play comprised 84 three-game series in each season from 1998 to 2012, divided as six series (18 games) for each of fourteen AL teams and as many as six for each of sixteen NL teams.\\r\\nAmong the 224 interleague pairs of teams, 11 played six games every year, which were scheduled in two three-game series \\"home and home\\", or one at each home ballpark. Five of these 11 special arrangements matched two teams in the same city or in neighboring cities, where they wholly or partly share territorial rights. Six were regional matches at greater distance, four of which were in the same state.\\r\\nThese special local and regional series accounted for 66 interleague games annually from 1998-2012, and the other 186 games were determined by rotation.\\r\\nThe 2001 season was suspended for one week due to the September 11 terrorist attacks and resulting disruptions in travel, resulting in games scheduled for September 11ÿ16 being rescheduled to the first week of October and the playoffs and World Series being rescheduled one week later than their originally planned dates, which resulted in the World Series continuing into early November.\\r\\nSchedule changes for 2013, precipitated by realignment that created two equal-sized leagues of 15 teams each, gave every team 20 interleague games.[2] Sixteen of which were determined by a match of divisions, one from each league; all teams in a given division play all teams in a given division from the other league. (Each plays a three-game series against four teams from the designated division and two two-game series against the remaining team.)\\r\\nThe matched divisions rotate annually:\\r\\nEach team played its four other interleague games against a designated \\"natural rival\\", with two games in each club's city. Thus all 30 teams, rather than 22 of 30 as previously, were deemed to have a natural rival in the other league. In 2013 the natural rivalry games were all scheduled for May 27 to May 30 (Memorial Day weekend) but in 2014 their scheduled dates range from May to August.\\r\\nTen of the natural rivalries from 2012 and earlier continued, while the HoustonÿTexas \\"Lone Star\\" rivalry had been transformed into an intra-division one with 19 games played. Five of the special arrangements were new in 2013 , including one each for Houston and Texas.\\r\\nFor 2014, four (4) of the five (5) new rivalries have been revised (?), all except Detroit and Pittsburgh.\\r\\nEvery team now plays 19 games against each of 4 opponents within its division (76 games), and 6 or 7 games against each of 10 opponents from other divisions within its own league (66 games).\\r\\nWhen corresponding divisions (i.e. NL East vs. AL East) play each other, a slight adjustment was made to the interleague games. Teams now play 6 games against their rival and 4 games (home and home) against two opponents plus one home and one away 3 game series (14 total) against the other four teams in the opposing division. This was done in 2015, and will next occur in 2018.\\r\\nOn September 12, 2017, the schedule of the 2018 season was released, which contains a number of changes to practices. The overall length of the season has been extended to 187 days with the addition of four off-days for all teams. All teams will play on Opening Day, which for 2018 will be held on March 29. Per the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Sunday Night Baseball will no longer be played on the final Sunday before the All-Star Game, in order to ease travel time for those who are participating in the Home Run Derby. A single, nationally-televised afternoon game will be played the following Thursday, with all other teams returning to play on Friday.[3]\\r\\nStart of Major League Baseball games depends on days of the week, game number in series, holidays, and other factors. Most games start at 7pm in the local time zone, so there are more night games than day games even though baseball is traditionally played during the day. The reason why there are more night baseball games is to attract more fans to ballparks as well as viewers from home because most fans would be at work or school during the day. On Mondays (excluding Opening Day and holidays), Tuesdays, and Fridays, games are almost exclusively played at night except for Cubs home games. Getaway days, days on which teams play their last game of the series before departing for another series in another city the next day, are usually day games, mainly Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. On Sundays, usually all but one are day games, with the final game reserved for ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball.\\r\\nAbout half of Saturday games are day games (1, 2 or 4pm ET). In some markets, Saturday night start an hour earlier than usual night start times, but other cities start Saturday night games at the same time as weeknight games. In conclusion, weekday games are only played at night except for getaway days while many weekend games are played during the day.\\r\\nThe initial pitch typically occurs 5 or 10 minutes after the hour, in order to allow time for pre-game ceremonies.","input":"How many games are in an mlb series?"},{"output":"16 January 1793","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of Australia from 1788ÿ1850 covers the early colonial period of Australia's history, from the arrival in 1788 of the First Fleet of British ships at Sydney, New South Wales, who established the penal colony, the scientific exploration of the continent and later, establishment of other Australian colonies and the beginnings of representative democratic government.\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean colonisation created a new dominant society in Australia in place of the pre-existing population of Indigenous Australians, and socio-political debate continues in the 21st century as to whether the colonisation process should be described as settlement, invasion, or a mixture of both.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is commonly reported that the  colonisation of Australia was driven by the need to address overcrowding in the British prison system, and the fact of the British losing the Thirteen Colonies of America in the American Revolution; however, it was simply not economically viable to transport convicts halfway around the world for this reason alone.[1] Many convicts were either skilled tradesmen or farmers who had been convicted for trivial crimes and were sentenced to seven years transportation, the time required to set up the infrastructure for the new colony. Convicts were often given pardons prior to or on completion of their sentences and were allocated parcels of land to farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Joseph Banks, the eminent scientist who had accompanied Lieutenant James Cook on his 1770 voyage, recommended Botany Bay as a suitable site.[2] Banks accepted an offer of assistance which by the American Loyalist James Matra in July 1783. Matra had visited Botany Bay with Banks in 1770 as a junior officer on the Endeavour commanded by James Cook. Under Banks's guidance, he rapidly produced \\"A Proposal for Establishing a Settlement in New South Wales\\" (24 August 1783), with a fully developed set of reasons for a colony composed of American Loyalists, Chinese and South Sea Islanders (but not convicts).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing an interview with Secretary of State Lord Sydney in March 1784, Matra amended his proposal to include convicts as settlers.[4] Matras plan can be seen to have provided the original blueprint for settlement in New South Wales.[5] A cabinet memorandum December 1784 shows the Government had Matras plan in mind when considering the creation of a settlement in New South Wales.[5][6] The London Chronicle of 12 October 1786 said: Mr. Matra, an Officer of the Treasury, who, sailing with Capt. Cook, had an opportunity of visiting Botany Bay, is the Gentleman who suggested the plan to Government of transporting convicts to that island. The Government also incorporated into the colonisation plan the project for settling Norfolk Island, with its attractions of timber and flax, proposed by Bankss Royal Society colleagues, Sir John Call and Sir George Young.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 May 1787, the First Fleet of 11 ships and about 1,530 people (736 convicts, 17 convicts' children, 211 marines, 27 marines' wives, 14 marines' children and about 300 officers and others) under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip set sail for Botany Bay.[8][9][10] A few days after arrival at Botany Bay the fleet moved to the more suitable Port Jackson where a settlement was established at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788.[11] This date later became Australia's national day, Australia Day. The colony was formally proclaimed by Governor Phillip on 7 February 1788 at Sydney. Sydney Cove offered a fresh water supply and a safe harbour, which Philip famously described as:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhillip named the settlement after the Home Secretary, Thomas Townshend, 1st Baron Sydney (Viscount Sydney from 1789). The only people at the flag raising ceremony and the formal taking of possession of the land in the name of King George III were Phillip and a few dozen marines and officers from the Supply, the rest of the ship's company and the convicts witnessing it from on board ship. The remaining ships of the Fleet were unable to leave Botany Bay until later on 26 January because of a tremendous gale.[13] The new colony was formally proclaimed as the Colony of New South Wales on 7 February.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 January 1788 a French expedition of two ships led by Admiral Jean-Fran?ois de La Prouse had arrived off Botany Bay, on the latest leg of a three-year voyage that had taken them from Brest, around Cape Horn, up the coast from Chile to California, north-west to Kamchatka, south-east to Easter Island, north-west to Macao, and on to the Philippines, the Friendly Isles, Hawaii and Norfolk Island.[15] Though amicably received, the French expedition was a troublesome matter for the British, as it showed the interest of France in the new land.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, on 2 February Lieutenant King, at Phillip's request, paid a courtesy call on the French and offered them any assistance they may need.[13] The French made the same offer to the British, as they were much better provisioned than the British and had enough supplies to last three years.[13] Neither of these offers was accepted. On 10 March[13] the French expedition, having taken on water and wood, left Botany Bay, never to be seen again. Phillip and La Prouse never met. La Prouse is remembered in a Sydney suburb of that name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast also date from this expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers ÿ most notably Watkin Tench ÿ left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney ÿ many \\"professional criminals\\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \\"passengers\\" through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From 1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1792, two French ships, La Recherche and L'Esprance anchored in a harbour near Tasmania's southernmost point they called Recherche Bay. This was at a time when Britain and France were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The expedition carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and hydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded and documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they encountered at the behest of the fledgling Socit D'Histoire Naturelle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a detachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the colony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was eloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \\"From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word \\"Botany Bay\\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Bellona transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793, she brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant of 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS Sirius; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the Sirius), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had formerly been at Sydney with the Juliana transport, and who married a free woman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant of 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with a free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the Government, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of expense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of convicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's clothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to the westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \\"Liberty Plains\\". It is now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom were transported in connection with the political and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting ÿ few of the first wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the Second Fleet in 1790, but life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' penal servitude, or \\"for the term of their natural lives\\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death sentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes. Upon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of work. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for example, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work gangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually assigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into prostitution.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be responsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the settlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central administration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at barracks such as the Hyde Park Barracks or the Parramatta female factory.\\r\\n\\r\\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed orders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-irons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at Port Arthur and Moreton Bay, for instance, were stricter than the one at Sydney, and the one at Norfolk Island was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs to build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of the convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers. Those convicts who behaved were eventually issued with ticket of leave, which allowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full sentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free settlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1789 former convict James Ruse produced the first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales. Ruse's 30 acre grant at Rose Hill, near Parramatta, was aptly named 'Experiment Farm'.[19] This was the colony's first successful farming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to grow enough food to support itself, and the standard of living for the residents gradually improved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1804 the Castle Hill convict rebellion was led by around 200 escaped, mostly Irish convicts, although it was broken up quickly by the New South Wales Corps. On 26 January 1808, there was a military rebellion against Governor Bligh led by John Macarthur. Following this, Governor Lachlan Macquarie was given a mandate to restore government and discipline in the colony. When he arrived in 1810, he forcibly deported the NSW Corps and brought the 73rd regiment to replace them.\\r\\n\\r\\n[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1795 George Bass and Matthew Flinders, accompanied by William Martin sailed the boat Tom Thumb out of Port Jackson to Botany Bay and explored the Georges River further upstream than had been done previously by the colonists. Their reports on their return led to the settlement of Banks' Town.[25] In March 1796 the same party embarked on a second voyage in a similar small boat, which they also called the Tom Thumb.[26] During this trip they travelled as far down the coast as Lake Illawarra, which they called Tom Thumb Lagoon. They discovered and explored Port Hacking. In 1798ÿ99, Bass and Flinders set out in a sloop and circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, thus proving it to be an island.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAboriginal guides and assistance in the European exploration of the colony were common and often vital to the success of missions. In 1801ÿ02 Matthew Flinders in The Investigator lead the first circumnavigation of Australia. Aboard ship was the Aboriginal explorer Bungaree, of the Sydney district, who became the first person born on the Australian continent to circumnavigate the Australian continent.[27] Previously, the famous Bennelong and a companion had become the first people born in the area of New South Wales to sail for Europe, when, in 1792 they accompanied Governor Phillip to England and were presented to King George III.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth succeeded in crossing the formidable barrier of forested gulleys and sheer cliffs presented by the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, by following the ridges instead of looking for a route through the valleys. At Mount Blaxland they looked out over \\"enough grass to support the stock of the colony for thirty years\\", and expansion of the British settlement into the interior could begin.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1824 the Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane, commissioned Hamilton Hume and former Royal Navy Captain William Hovell to lead an expedition to find new grazing land in the south of the colony, and also to find an answer to the mystery of where New South Wales's western rivers flowed. Over 16 weeks in 1824ÿ25, Hume and Hovell journeyed to Port Phillip and back. They made many important discoveries including the Murray River (which they named the Hume), many of its tributaries, and good agricultural and grazing lands between Gunning, New South Wales and Corio Bay, Victoria.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Sturt led an expedition along the Macquarie River in 1828 and discovered the Darling River. A theory had developed that the inland rivers of New South Wales were draining into an inland sea. Leading a second expedition in 1829, Sturt followed the Murrumbidgee River into a 'broad and noble river', the Murray River, which he named after Sir George Murray, secretary of state for the colonies. His party then followed this river to its junction with the Darling River, facing two threatening encounters with local Aboriginal people along the way. Sturt continued down river on to Lake Alexandrina, where the Murray meets the sea in South Australia. Suffering greatly, the party had to then row back upstream hundreds of kilometres for the return journey.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nSurveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell conducted a series of expeditions from the 1830s to 'fill in the gaps' left by these previous expeditions. He was meticulous in seeking to record the original Aboriginal place names around the colony, for which reason the majority of place names to this day retain their Aboriginal titles.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Polish scientist/explorer Count Paul Edmund Strzelecki conducted surveying work in the Australian Alps in 1839 and became the first European to ascend Australia's highest peak, which he named Mount Kosciuszko in honour of the Polish patriot Tadeusz Kosciuszko.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional Aboriginal society had been governed by councils of elders and a corporate decision-making process, but the first European-style governments established after 1788 were autocratic and run by appointed governors ÿ although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the doctrine of reception, thus notions of the rights and processes established by the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689 were brought from Britain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement of the colonies.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second Fleet in 1790 brought to Sydney two men who were to play important roles in the colony's future. One was D'Arcy Wentworth, whose son, William Charles, went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was John Macarthur, a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the Rum Rebellion against the governor, William Bligh.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of Lachlan Macquarie, began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free Crown land. From the late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known as the Nineteen Counties.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised settlement limits: they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class. As a result of opposition from the labouring and artisan classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of Van Diemen's Land (first settled in 1803, later renamed Tasmania) and Moreton Bay (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Swan River Settlement (as Western Australia was originally known), centred on Perth, was founded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) New Zealand was part of New South Wales until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first governments established after 1788 were autocratic and each colony was governed by a British Governor, appointed by the British monarch. There was considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In most cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the British military. The New South Wales Corps, which was in charge of New South Wales, became known as the \\"Rum Corps\\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of rum, which was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In New South Wales this led to the \\"Rum Rebellion\\". Although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the doctrine of reception, thus notions of the rights and processes established by the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689 were brought from Britain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement of the colonies.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest legislative body in Australia, the New South Wales Legislative Council, was created in 1825 as an appointed body to advise the Governor of New South Wales. William Wentworth established the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand democratic government for New South Wales. The reformist attorney general, John Plunkett, sought to apply Enlightenment principles to governance in the colony, pursuing the establishment of equality before the law, first by extending jury rights to emancipists, then by extending legal protections to convicts, assigned servants and Aborigines. Plunkett twice charged the colonist perpetrators of the Myall Creek massacre of Aborigines with murder, resulting in a conviction and his landmark Church Act of 1836 disestablished the Church of England and established legal equality between Anglicans, Catholics, Presbyterians and later Methodists.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1840, the Adelaide City Council and the Sydney City Council were established. Men who possessed 1000 pounds worth of property were able to stand for election and wealthy landowners were permitted up to four votes each in elections. Australia's first parliamentary elections were conducted for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843, again with voting rights (for males only) tied to property ownership or financial capacity. Voter rights were extended further in New South Wales in 1850 and elections for legislative councils were held in the colonies of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the mid-19th century, there was a strong desire for representative and responsible government in the colonies of Australia, later fed by the democratic spirit of the goldfields and the ideas of the great reform movements sweeping Europe, the United States and the British Empire. The end of convict transportation accelerated reform in the 1840s and 1850s. The Australian Colonies Government Act [1850] was a landmark development which granted representative constitutions to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and the colonies enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments ÿ though the constitutions generally maintained the role of the colonial upper houses as representative of social and economic \\"interests\\" and all established constitutional monarchies with the British monarch as the symbolic head of state.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonies relied heavily on imports from England for survival.\\r\\nThe official currency of the colonies was the British pound, but the unofficial currency and most readily accepted trade good was rum. During this period Australian businessmen began to prosper. For example, the partnership of Berry and Wollstonecraft made enormous profits by means of land grants, convict labour, and exporting native cedar back to England.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince time immemorial in Australia, indigenous people had performed the rites and rituals of the animist religion of the Dreamtime. The permanent presence of Christianity in Australia however, came with the arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney in 1788. As a British colony, the predominant Christian denomination was the Church of England, but one-tenth of all the convicts who came to Australia on the First Fleet were Catholic, and at least half of them were born in Ireland.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nA small proportion of British marines were also Catholic. Some of the Irish convicts had been Transported to Australia for political crimes or social rebellion in Ireland, so the authorities were suspicious of the minority religion for the first three decades of settlement.[38] It was therefore the crew of the French explorer La Prouse who conducted the first Catholic ceremony on Australian soil in 1788 ÿ the burial of Father Louis Receveur, a Franciscan monk, who died while the ships were at anchor at Botany Bay, while on a mission to explore the Pacific.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early colonial times, Church of England clergy worked closely with the governors. Richard Johnson, Anglican chaplain to the First Fleet, was charged by the governor, Arthur Phillip, with improving \\"public morality\\" in the colony, but he was also heavily involved in health and education.[40] The Reverend Samuel Marsden (1765ÿ1838) had magisterial duties, and so was equated with the authorities by the convicts. He became known as the 'floging parson' for the severity of his punishments[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nCatholic convicts were compelled to attend Church of England services and their children and orphans were raised by the authorities as Protestant.[42] The first Catholic priest colonists arrived in Australia as convicts in 1800 ÿ James Harold, James Dixon, and Peter O'Neill, who had been convicted for 'complicity' in the Irish 1798 Rebellion. Fr Dixon was conditionally emancipated and permitted to celebrate Mass. On 15 May 1803, in vestments made from curtains and with a chalice made of tin he conducted the first Catholic Mass in New South Wales.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Irish led Castle Hill Rebellion of 1804 alarmed the British authorities and Dixon's permission to celebrate Mass was revoked. Fr Jeremiah Flynn, an Irish Cistercian, was appointed as Prefect Apostolic of New Holland, and set out from Britain for the colony, uninvited. Watched by authorities, Flynn secretly performed priestly duties before being arrested and deported to London. Reaction to the affair in Britain led to two further priests being allowed to travel to the Colony in 1820 ÿ John Joseph Therry and Philip Connolly.[38] The foundation stone for the first St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney was laid on 29 October 1821 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe absence of a Catholic mission in Australia before 1818 reflected the legal disabilities of Catholics in Britain and the difficult position of Ireland within the British Empire. The government therefore endorsed the English Benedictines to lead the early Church in the Colony.[43] The Church of England lost its legal privileges in the Colony of New South Wales by the Church Act of 1836. Drafted by the reformist attorney-general John Plunkett, the Act established legal equality for Anglicans, Catholics and Presbyterians and was later extended to Methodists.[44] Catholic missionary William Ullathorne criticised the convict system, publishing a pamphlet, The Horrors of Transportation Briefly Unfolded to the People, in Britain in 1837.[45] Laywoman Caroline Chisolm did ecumenical work to alleviate the suffering of female migrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, education was informal, primarily occurring in the home.[citation needed] At the instigation of the then British Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, and with the patronage of King William IV, Australia's oldest surviving independent school, The King's School, Parramatta, was founded in 1831 as part of an effort to establish grammar schools in the colony.[46] By 1833, there were around ten Catholic schools in the Australian colonies.[38] Today one in five Australian students attend Catholic schools.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nSydney's first Catholic Bishop, John Bede Polding requested a community of nuns be sent to the colony and five Irish Sisters of Charity arrived in 1838 to set about pastoral care of convict women and work in schools and hospitals before going on to found their own schools and hospitals.[48] At Polding's request, the Christian Brothers arrived in Sydney in 1843 to assist in schools. Establishing themselves first at Sevenhill, in South Australia in 1848, the Jesuits were the first religious order of priests to enter and establish houses in South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory ÿ where they established schools and missions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Australian folksongs date to this period.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the first true works of Australian literature produced over this period was the accounts of the settlement of Sydney by Watkin Tench, a captain of the marines on the First Fleet to arrive in 1788. In 1819, poet, explorer, journalist and politician William Wentworth published the first book written by an Australian: A Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales and Its Dependent Settlements in Van Diemen's Land, With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America,[49] in which he advocated an elected assembly for New South Wales, trial by jury and settlement of Australia by free emigrants rather than convicts. In 1838 The Guardian: a tale by Anna Maria Bunn was published in Sydney. It was the first Australian novel printed and published in mainland Australia and the first Australian novel written by a woman. It is a Gothic romance.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean traditions of Australian theatre also came with the First Fleet, with the first production being performed in 1789 by convicts?: The Recruiting Officer by George Farquhar.[51] Two centuries later, the extraordinary circumstances of the foundations of Australian theatre were recounted in Our Country's Good by Timberlake Wertenbaker: the participants were prisoners watched by sadistic guards and the leading lady was under threat of the death penalty. The play is based on Thomas Keneally's novel The Playmaker.[51] The Theatre Royal, Hobart, opened in 1837 and it remains the oldest theatre in Australia.[52] The Melbourne Athenaeum is one of the oldest public institutions in Australia, founded in 1839 and it served as library, school of arts and dance hall (and later became Australia's first cinema, screening The Story of the Kelly Gang, the world's first feature film in 1906).[53] The Queen's Theatre, Adelaide opened with Shakespeare in 1841 and is today the oldest theatre on the mainland.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAboriginal reactions to the sudden arrival of British settlers were varied, but often hostile when the presence of the colonisers led to competition over resources, and to the occupation by the British of Aboriginal lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources led to starvation. By contrast with New Zealand, where the Treaty of Waitangi was seen to legitimise British settlement, no treaty was signed with Aborigines, who never authorised British colonisation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the historian Geoffrey Blainey, in Australia during the colonial period:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"In a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation\\".[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1980s, the use of the word \\"invasion\\" to describe the British colonisation of Australia has been highly controversial. According to Australian Henry Reynolds however, government officials and ordinary settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries frequently used words such as \\"invasion\\" and \\"warfare\\" to describe their presence and relations with Indigenous Australians. In his book The Other Side of the Frontier,[56] Reynolds described in detail armed resistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of guerilla warfare, beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in the Sydney settlement, wrote of local Aborigines:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity and safety concurred.[57]\\r\\nIn 1847, Western Australian barrister E.W. Landor stated: \\"We have seized upon the country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as Julius Caesar did when he took possession of Britain.\\"[58] In most cases, Reynolds says, Aborigines initially resisted British presence. In a letter to the Launceston Advertiser in 1831, a settler wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies ÿ as invaders ÿ as oppressors and persecutors ÿ they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.[59]\\r\\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the nineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror due to attacks by Aborigines determined to kill them or drive them off their lands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least, temporarily effective; the Aboriginal killings of men, sheep and cattle, and burning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal resistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in 1881 the editor of The Queenslander wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.[60]\\r\\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century belies the \\"myth\\" of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often reacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous indiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.[61] Among the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the Pinjarra massacre and the Myall Creek massacre.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamous Aborigines who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include Pemulwuy and Yagan. In Tasmania, the \\"Black War\\" was fought in the first half of the nineteenth century.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory of Australia:","input":"When did the first free settlers arrived in australia?"},{"output":"20 free states, 4 border and slave states","context":"During the American Civil War (1861ÿ1865), the Union referred to the United States of America and specifically to the national government of President Abraham Lincoln and the 20 free states, 4 border and slave states (some with split governments and troops sent both north and south) that supported it. The Union was opposed by 11 southern slave states (or 13, according to the Southern view and one western territory) that formed the Confederate States of America, or also known as \\"the Confederacy\\".\\r\\nAll of the Union's states provided soldiers for the United States Army (also known as the Union Army), though the border areas also sent tens of thousands of soldiers south into the Confederacy. The Border states were essential as a supply base for the Union invasion of the Confederacy, and Lincoln realized he could not win the war without control of them, especially Maryland, which lay north of the national capital of Washington, D.C.. The Northeast and upper Midwest provided the industrial resources for a mechanized war producing large quantities of munitions and supplies, as well as financing for the war. The Midwest provided soldiers, food, horses, financial support, and training camps. Army hospitals were set up across the Union. Most states had Republican Party governors who energetically supported the war effort and suppressed anti-war subversion in 1863ÿ64. The Democratic Party strongly supported the war at the beginning in 1861 but by 1862, was split between the War Democrats and the anti-war element led by the \\"Copperheads\\". The Democrats made major electoral gains in 1862 in state elections, most notably in New York. They lost ground in 1863, especially in Ohio. In 1864, the Republicans campaigned under the National Union Party banner, which attracted many War Democrats and soldiers and scored a landslide victory for Lincoln and his entire ticket against opposition candidate George B. McClellan, former General-in-Chief of the Union Army and its eastern Army of the Potomac.\\r\\nThe war years were quite prosperous except where serious fighting and guerrilla warfare took place along the southern border. Prosperity was stimulated by heavy government spending and the creation of an entirely new national banking system. The Union states invested a great deal of money and effort in organizing psychological and social support for soldiers' wives, widows, and orphans, and for the soldiers themselves. Most soldiers were volunteers, although after 1862 many volunteered in order to escape the draft and to take advantage of generous cash bounties on offer from states and localities. Draft resistance was notable in some larger cities, especially New York City with its massive anti-draft riots of July 1863 and in some remote districts such as the coal mining areas of Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the context of the American Civil War, the Union is sometimes referred to as \\"the North\\", both then and now, as opposed to the Confederacy, which was \\"the South\\". The Union never recognized the legitimacy of the Confederacy's secession and maintained at all times that it remained entirely a part of the United States of America. In foreign affairs the Union was the only side recognized by all other nations, none of which officially recognized the Confederate government. The term \\"Union\\" occurs in the first governing document of the United States, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. The subsequent Constitution of 1787 was issued and ratified in the name not of the states, but of \\"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union ...\\". Union, for the United States of America, is then repeated in such clauses as the Admission to the Union clause in Article IV, Section 3.\\r\\nEven before the war started, the phrase \\"preserve the Union\\" was commonplace, and a \\"union of states\\" had been used to refer to the entire United States of America. Using the term \\"Union\\" to apply to the non-secessionist side carried a connotation of legitimacy as the continuation of the pre-existing political entity.[1]\\r\\nConfederates generally saw the Union states as being opposed to slavery, occasionally referring to them as abolitionists, as in reference to the U.S. Navy as the \\"Abolition fleet\\" and the U.S. Army as the \\"Abolition forces\\".[2]\\r\\nUnlike the Confederacy, the Union had a large industrialized and urbanized area (the Northeast), and more advanced commercial, transportation and financial systems than the rural South.[3] Additionally, the Union states had a manpower advantage of 5 to 2 at the start of the war.[4]\\r\\nYear by year, the Confederacy shrank and lost control of increasing quantities of resources and population. Meanwhile, the Union turned its growing potential advantage into a much stronger military force. However, much of the Union strength had to be used to garrison conquered areas, and to protect railroads and other vital points. The Union's great advantages in population and industry would prove to be vital long-term factors in its victory over the Confederacy, but it took the Union a long while to fully mobilize these resources.\\r\\nThe attack on Fort Sumter rallied the North to the defense of American nationalism. Historian, Allan Nevins, says:\\r\\nThe thunderclap of Sumter produced a startling crystallization of Northern sentiment ... Anger swept the land. From every side came news of mass meetings, speeches, resolutions, tenders of business support, the muster of companies and regiments, the determined action of governors and legislatures.[5]\\r\\nMcClintock states:\\r\\nAt the time, Northerners were right to wonder at the near unanimity that so quickly followed long months of bitterness and discord. It would not last throughout the protracted war to come ÿ or even through the year ÿ but in that moment of unity was laid bare the common Northern nationalism usually hidden by the fierce battles more typical of the political arena.\\"[6]\\r\\nHistorian Michael Smith, argues that, as the war ground on year after year, the spirit of American republicanism grew stronger and generated fears of corruption in high places. Voters became afraid of power being centralized in Washington, extravagant spending, and war profiteering. Democratic candidates emphasized these fears. The candidates added that rapid modernization was putting too much political power in the hands of Eastern financiers and industrialists. They warned that the abolition of slavery would bring a flood of freed blacks into the labor market of the North.\\r\\nRepublicans responded with claims of defeatism. They indicted Copperheads for criminal conspiracies to free Confederate prisoners of war, and played on the spirit of nationalism and the growing hatred of the slaveowners, as the guilty party in the war.[7]\\r\\nHistorians have overwhelmingly praised the \\"political genius\\" of Abraham Lincoln's performance as President.[8] His first priority was military victory. This required that he master entirely new skills as a strategist and diplomat. He oversaw supplies, finances, manpower, the selection of generals, and the course of overall strategy. Working closely with state and local politicians, he rallied public opinion and (at Gettysburg) articulated a national mission that has defined America ever since. Lincoln's charm and willingness to cooperate with political and personal enemies made Washington work much more smoothly than Richmond, the Confederate capital, and his wit smoothed many rough edges. Lincoln's cabinet proved much stronger and more efficient than Davis's, as Lincoln channeled personal rivalries into a competition for excellence rather than mutual destruction. With William Seward at State, Salmon P. Chase at the Treasury, and (from 1862) Edwin Stanton at the War Department, Lincoln had a powerful cabinet of determined men. Except for monitoring major appointments and decisions, Lincoln gave them free rein to end the Confederate rebellion.[9] Cabinet (government)\\r\\nThe Republican Congress passed many major laws that reshaped the nation's economy, financial system, tax system, land system, and higher education system. These included: the Morrill tariff, the Homestead Act, the Pacific Railroad Act, and the National Banking Act.[10] Lincoln paid relatively little attention to this legislation as he focused on war issues but he worked smoothly with powerful Congressional leaders such as Thaddeus Stevens (on taxation and spending), Charles Sumner (on foreign affairs), Lyman Trumbull (on legal issues), Justin Smith Morrill (on land grants and tariffs) and William Pitt Fessenden (on finances).[11]\\r\\nMilitary and reconstruction issues were another matter. Lincoln, as the leader of the moderate and conservative factions of the Republican Party, often crossed swords with the Radical Republicans, led by Stevens and Sumner. Author, Bruce Tap, shows that Congress challenged Lincoln's role as commander-in-chief through the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War. It was a joint committee of both houses that was dominated by the Radical Republicans, who took a hard line against the Confederacy. During the 37th and 38th Congresses, the committee investigated every aspect of Union military operations, with special attention to finding commanders culpable for military defeats. It assumed an inevitable Union victory. Failure was perceived to indicate evil motivations or personal failures. The committee distrusted graduates of the US Military Academy at West Point, since many of the academy's alumni were leaders of the enemy army. Members of the committee much preferred political generals with a satisfactory political record. Some of the committee suggested that West-Pointers who engaged in strategic maneuver were cowardly or even disloyal. It ended up endorsing incompetent but politically correct generals.[12]\\r\\nThe opposition came from Copperhead Democrats, who were strongest in the Midwest and wanted to allow Confederate secession. In the East, opposition to the war was strongest among Irish Catholics, but also included business interests connected to the South typified by August Belmont. The Democratic Party was deeply split. In 1861 most Democrats supported the war. However, the party increasingly split down the middle between the moderates who supported the war effort, and the peace element, including Copperheads, who did not. It scored major gains in the 1862 elections, and elected the moderate Horatio Seymour as governor of New York. They gained 28 seats in the House of Representatives but Republicans retained control of both the House and the Senate.\\r\\nThe 1862 election for the Indiana legislature was especially hard-fought. Though the Democrats gained control of the legislature, they were unable to impede the war effort. Republican Governor Oliver P. Morton was able to maintain control of the state's contribution to the war effort despite the Democrat majority.[13] Washington was especially helpful in 1864 in arranging furloughs to allow Hoosier soldiers to return home so they could vote in elections.[14] Across the North in 1864, the great majority of soldiers voted Republican. Men who had been Democrats before the war often abstained or voted Republican.[15]\\r\\nAs the federal draft laws tightened, there was serious unrest among Copperhead strongholds, such as the Irish in the Pennsylvania coal mining districts. The government needed the coal more than the draftees, so it ignored the largely non-violent draft dodging there.[16][17] The violent New York City draft riots of 1863 were suppressed by the U.S. Army firing grape shot down cobblestone city streets.[18][19]\\r\\nThe Democrats nominated George McClellan, a War Democrat for the 1864 presidential election but gave him an anti-war platform. In terms of Congress the opposition against the war was nearly powerless ÿ as was the case in most states. In Indiana and Illinois pro-war governors circumvented anti-war legislatures elected in 1862. For 30 years after the war the Democrats carried the burden of having opposed the martyred Lincoln, who was viewed by many as the salvation of the Union and the destroyer of slavery.[20]\\r\\nThe Copperheads were a large faction of northern Democrats who opposed the war, demanding an immediate peace settlement. They said they wanted to restore \\"the Union as it was\\" (that is, with the South and with slavery) but they realized that the Confederacy would never voluntarily rejoin the U.S.[21] The most prominent Copperhead was Ohio's Clement L. Vallandigham, a Congressman and leader of the Democratic Party in Ohio. He was defeated in an intense election for governor in 1863. Republican prosecutors in the Midwest accused some Copperhead activists of treason in a series of trials in 1864.[22]\\r\\nCopperheadism was a grassroots movement, strongest in the area just north of the Ohio River, as well as some urban ethnic wards. Some historians have argued that it represented a traditionalistic element alarmed at the rapid modernization of society sponsored by the Republican Party. It looked back to Jacksonian Democracy for inspiration ÿ with ideals that promoted an agrarian rather than industrialized concept of society. Weber (2006) argues that the Copperheads damaged the Union war effort by fighting the draft, encouraging desertion and forming conspiracies.[23] However, other historians say the Copperheads were a legitimate opposition force unfairly treated by the government, adding that the draft was in disrepute and that the Republicans greatly exaggerated the conspiracies for partisan reasons.[24] Copperheadism was a major issue in the 1864 presidential election ÿ its strength waxed when Union armies were doing poorly and waned when they won great victories. After the fall of Atlanta in September 1864, military success seemed assured and Copperheadism collapsed.[21]\\r\\nEnthusiastic young men clamored to join the Union army in 1861. They came with family support for reasons of patriotism and excitement. Washington decided to keep the small regular army intact; it only had 16,000 men and was needed to guard the frontier. Its officers could, however, join the temporary new volunteer army that was formed, with expectations that their experience would lead to rapid promotions. The problem with volunteering, however, was its serious lack of planning, leadership, and organization at the highest levels. Washington called on the states for troops, and every northern governor set about raising and equipping regiments, and sent the bills to the War Department. The men could elect the junior officers, while the governor appointed the senior officers, and Lincoln appointed the generals. Typically, politicians used their local organizations to raise troops and were in line (if healthy enough) to become colonel. The problem was that the War Department, under the disorganized leadership of Simon Cameron, also authorized local and private groups to raise regiments. The result was widespread confusion and delay.\\r\\nPennsylvania, for example, had acute problems. When Washington called for 10 more regiments, enough men volunteered to form 30. However, they were scattered among 70 different new units, none of them a complete regiment. Not until Washington approved gubernatorial control of all new units was the problem resolved. Allan Nevins is particularly scathing of this in his analysis: \\"A President more exact, systematic and vigilant than Lincoln, a Secretary more alert and clearheaded than Cameron, would have prevented these difficulties.\\"[25]\\r\\nBy the end of 1861, 700,000 soldiers were drilling in Union camps. The first wave in spring was called up for only 90 days, then the soldiers went home or reenlisted. Later waves enlisted for three years.\\r\\nThe new recruits spent their time drilling in company and regiment formations. The combat in the first year, though strategically important, involved relatively small forces and few casualties. Sickness was a much more serious cause of hospitalization or death.\\r\\nIn the first few months, men wore low quality uniforms made of \\"shoddy\\" material, but by fall, sturdy wool uniformsin bluewere standard. The nation's factories were converted to produce the rifles, cannons, wagons, tents, telegraph sets, and the myriad of other special items the army needed.\\r\\nWhile business had been slow or depressed in spring 1861, because of war fears and Southern boycotts, by fall business was hiring again, offering young men jobs that were an alternative way to help win the war. Nonpartisanship was the rule in the first year, but by summer 1862, many Democrats had stopped supporting the war effort, and volunteering fell off sharply in their strongholds.\\r\\nThe calls for more and more soldiers continued, so states and localities responded by offering cash bonuses. By 1863, a draft law was in effect, but few men actually were drafted and served, since the law was designed to get them to volunteer or hire a substitute. Others hid away or left the country. With the Emancipation Proclamation taking effect in January 1863, localities could meet their draft quota by sponsoring regiments of ex-slaves organized in the South.[26]\\r\\nMichigan was especially eager to send thousands of volunteers.[27] A study of the cities of Grand Rapids and Niles shows an overwhelming surge of nationalism in 1861, whipping up enthusiasm for the war in all segments of society, and all political, religious, ethnic, and occupational groups. However, by 1862 the casualties were mounting, and the war was increasingly focused on freeing the slaves in addition to preserving the Union. Copperhead Democrats called the war a failure, and it became an increasingly partisan Republican effort.[28] Michigan voters remained evenly split between the parties in the presidential election of 1864.[29]\\r\\nPerman (2010) says historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer, and die over four years:\\r\\nSome historians emphasize that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm beliefs about the importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such as the defense of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that, no matter what he thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes affected his reasons for continuing to fight.[30]\\r\\nOn the whole, the national, state, and local governments handled the avalanche of paperwork effectively. Skills developed in insurance and financial companies formed the basis of systematic forms, copies, summaries, and filing systems used to make sense of masses of human data. The leader in this effort, John Shaw Billings, later developed a system of mechanically storing, sorting, and counting numerical information using punch cards. Nevertheless, old-fashioned methodology had to be recognized and overcome. An illustrative case study came in New Hampshire, where the critical post of state adjutant general was held in 1861ÿ64 by elderly politician Anthony C. Colby (1792ÿ1873) and his son Daniel E. Colby (1816ÿ1891). They were patriotic, but were overwhelmed with the complexity of their duties. The state lost track of men who enlisted after 1861; it had no personnel records or information on volunteers, substitutes, or draftees, and there was no inventory of weaponry and supplies. Nathaniel Head (1828ÿ1883) took over in 1864, obtained an adequate budget and office staff, and reconstructed the missing paperwork. As result, widows, orphans, and disabled veterans received the postwar payments they had earned.[31]\\r\\nMore soldiers died of disease than from battle injuries, and even larger numbers were temporarily incapacitated by wounds, disease, and accidents. The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state.\\r\\nThe hygiene of the camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of chicken pox, mumps, whooping cough, and especially, measles. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid fever, and malaria. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.[32] This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department,[33] and the United States Sanitary Commission, a new private agency.[34] Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the United States Christian Commission, as well as smaller private agencies, such as the Women's Central Association of Relief for Sick and Wounded in the Army (WCAR), founded in 1861 by Henry Whitney Bellows, a Unitarian minister, and the social reformer Dorothea Dix. Systematic funding appeals raised public consciousness as well as millions of dollars. Many thousands of volunteers worked in the hospitals and rest homes, most famously poet Walt Whitman. Frederick Law Olmsted, a famous landscape architect, was the highly efficient executive director of the Sanitary Commission.[35]\\r\\nStates could use their own tax money to support their troops, as Ohio did. Under the energetic leadership of Governor David Tod, a War Democrat who won office on a coalition \\"Union Party\\" ticket with Republicans, Ohio acted vigorously. Following the unexpected carnage at the battle of Shiloh in April 1862, Ohio sent three steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals equipped with doctors, nurses, and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to 11 hospital ships, and the state set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes, to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.[36]\\r\\nThe Christian Commission comprised 6,000 volunteers who aided chaplains in many ways.[37] For example, its agents distributed Bibles, delivered sermons, helped with sending letters home, taught men to read and write, and set up camp libraries.[38]\\r\\nThe Army learned many lessons and modernized its procedures,[39] and medical scienceespecially surgerymade many advances.[40] In the long run, the wartime experiences of the numerous Union commissions modernized public welfare, and set the stage for largescale community philanthropy in America based on fund raising campaigns and private donations.[41]\\r\\nAdditionally, women gained new public roles. For example, Mary Livermore (1820ÿ1905), the manager of the Chicago branch of the US Sanitary Commission, used her newfound organizational skills to mobilize support for women's suffrage after the war. She argued that women needed more education and job opportunities to help them fulfill their role of serving others.[42]\\r\\nThe Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns.[43] The pioneer was John Shaw Billings (1838ÿ1913). A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built two of the world's most important libraries, Library of the Surgeon General's Office (now the National Library of Medicine) and the New York Public Library; he also figured out how to mechanically analyze data by turning it into numbers and punching onto the computer punch card as developed by his student Herman Hollerith. Hollerith's company became International Business Machines (IBM) in 1911.[44]\\r\\nBoth sides operated prison camps; they handled about 400,000 captives, but many other prisoners were quickly released and never sent to camps. The Record and Pension Office in 1901 counted 211,000 Northerners who were captured. In 1861ÿ63 most were immediately paroled; after the parole exchange system broke down in 1863, about 195,000 went to Confederate prison camps. Some tried to escape but few succeeded. By contrast 464,000 Confederates were captured (many in the final days) and 215,000 imprisoned. Over 30,000 Union and nearly 26,000 Confederate prisoners died in captivity. Just over 12% of the captives in Northern prisons died, compared to 15.5% for Southern prisons.[45][46]\\r\\nDiscontent with the 1863 draft law led to riots in several cities and in rural areas as well. By far the most important were the New York City draft riots of July 13 to July 16, 1863.[47] Irish Catholic and other workers fought police, militia and regular army units until the Army used artillery to sweep the streets. Initially focused on the draft, the protests quickly expanded into violent attacks on blacks in New York City, with many killed on the streets.[48]\\r\\nSmall-scale riots broke out in ethnic German and Irish districts, and in areas along the Ohio River with many Copperheads. Holmes County, Ohio was an isolated parochial area dominated by Pennsylvania Dutch and some recent German immigrants. It was a Democratic stronghold and few men dared speak out in favor of conscription. Local politicians denounced Lincoln and Congress as despotic, seeing the draft law as a violation of their local autonomy. In June 1863, small-scale disturbances broke out; they ended when the Army sent in armed units.[49][50][51]\\r\\nThe Union economy grew and prospered during the war while fielding a very large army and navy.[52] The Republicans in Washington had a Whiggish vision of an industrial nation, with great cities, efficient factories, productive farms, all national banks, all knit together by a modern railroad system, to be mobilized by the United States Military Railroad. The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit. With the South gone and Northern Democrats weak, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for most of the rest. Economic historians attribute the remainder of the cost of the war to inflation. Congress wrote an elaborate program of economic modernization that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy.[53] For a list of the major industrialists see .\\r\\nIn 1860 the Treasury was a small operation that funded the small-scale operations of the government through land sales and customs based on a low tariff.[54] Peacetime revenues were trivial in comparison with the cost of a full-scale war but the Treasury Department under Secretary Salmon P. Chase showed unusual ingenuity in financing the war without crippling the economy.[55] Many new taxes were imposed and always with a patriotic theme comparing the financial sacrifice to the sacrifices of life and limb. The government paid for supplies in real money, which encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of their politics. By contrast the Confederacy gave paper promissory notes when it seized property, so that even loyal Confederates would hide their horses and mules rather than sell them for dubious paper. Overall the Northern financial system was highly successful in raising money and turning patriotism into profit, while the Confederate system impoverished its patriots.[56]\\r\\nThe United States needed $3.1 billion to pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil Warover $400?million just in 1862 alone.[57] Apart from tariffs, the largest revenue by far came from new excise taxesa sort of value added taxthat was imposed on every sort of manufactured item. Second came much higher tariffs, through several Morrill tariff laws. Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war's end.\\r\\nApart from taxes, the second major source of income was government bonds. For the first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by banker Jay Cooke. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only national banks could do that and Chase made it easy to become a national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the \\"First National Bank\\".[58] Third, the government printed paper money called \\"greenbacks\\". They led to endless controversy because they caused inflation.[59]\\r\\nThe North's most important war measure was perhaps the creation of a system of national banks that provided a sound currency for the industrial expansion. Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.[60]\\r\\nSecretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10?points in order to generate more revenues.[61] These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The Morrill Tariff of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.[62]\\r\\nCustoms revenue from tariffs totaled $345?million from 1861 through 1865 or 43% of all federal tax revenue.\\r\\nThe U.S. government owned vast amounts of good land (mostly from the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846). The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt. Land grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western plains and link up to California. Together with the free lands provided farmers by the Homestead Law the low-cost farm lands provided by the land grants sped up the expansion of commercial agriculture in the West.\\r\\nThe 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free. Land grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms (80 to 200 acres) at low prices with extended credit. In addition the government sponsored fresh information, scientific methods and the latest techniques through the newly established Department of Agriculture and the Morrill Land Grant College Act.[63][64]\\r\\nAgriculture was the largest single industry and it prospered during the war.[65][66] Prices were high, pulled up by a strong demand from the army and from Britain (which depended on American wheat for a fourth of its food imports). The war acted as a catalyst that encouraged the rapid adoption of horse-drawn machinery and other implements. The rapid spread of recent inventions such as the reaper and mower made the work force efficient, even as hundreds of thousands of farmers were in the army. Many wives took their place and often consulted by mail on what to do; increasingly they relied on community and extended kin for advice and help.[67]\\r\\nThe Union used hundreds of thousands of animals. The Army had plenty of cash to purchase them from farmers and breeders but especially in the early months the quality was mixed.[68] Horses were needed for cavalry and artillery.[69] Mules pulled the wagons. The supply held up, despite an unprecedented epidemic of glanders, a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians.[70] In the South, the Union army shot all the horses it did not need to keep them out of Confederate hands.\\r\\nThe Treasury started buying cotton during the war, for shipment to Europe and northern mills. The sellers were Southern planters who needed the cash, regardless of their patriotism. The Northern buyers could make heavy profits, which annoyed soldiers like Ulysses Grant. He blamed Jewish traders and expelled them from his lines in 1862 but Lincoln quickly overruled this show of anti-semitism. Critics said the cotton trade helped the South, prolonged the war and fostered corruption. Lincoln decided to continue the trade for fear that Britain might intervene if its textile manufacturers were denied raw material. Another goal was to foster latent Unionism in Southern border states. Northern textile manufacturers needed cotton to remain in business and to make uniforms, while cotton exports to Europe provided an important source of gold to finance the war.[71]\\r\\nThe Protestant religion was quite strong in the North in the 1860s. The United States Christian Commission sent agents into the Army camps to provide psychological support as well as books, newspapers, food and clothing. Through prayer, sermons and welfare operations, the agents ministered to soldiers' spiritual as well as temporal needs as they sought to bring the men to a Christian way of life.[72] Most churches made an effort to support their soldiers in the field and especially their families back home. Much of the political rhetoric of the era had a distinct religious tone.[73]\\r\\nThe Protestant clergy in America took a variety of positions. In general, the pietistic denominations such as the Methodists, Northern Baptists and Congregationalists strongly supported the war effort. Catholics, Episcopalians, Lutherans and conservative Presbyterians generally avoided any discussion of the war, so it would not bitterly divide their membership. The Quakers, while giving strong support to the abolitionist movement on a personal level, refused to take a denominational position. Some clergymen who supported the Confederacy were denounced as Copperheads, especially in the border regions.[74][75]\\r\\nMany Northerners had only recently become religious (following the Second Great Awakening) and religion was a powerful force in their lives. No denomination was more active in supporting the Union than the Methodist Episcopal Church. Carwardine[76] argues that for many Methodists, the victory of Lincoln in 1860 heralded the arrival of the kingdom of God in America. They were moved into action by a vision of freedom for slaves, freedom from the persecutions of godly abolitionists, release from the Slave Power's evil grip on the American government and the promise of a new direction for the Union.[76] Methodists formed a major element of the popular support for the Radical Republicans with their hard line toward the white South. Dissident Methodists left the church.[77] During Reconstruction the Methodists took the lead in helping form Methodist churches for Freedmen and moving into Southern cities even to the point of taking control, with Army help, of buildings that had belonged to the southern branch of the church.[78][79]\\r\\nThe Methodist family magazine Ladies' Repository promoted Christian family activism. Its articles provided moral uplift to women and children. It portrayed the War as a great moral crusade against a decadent Southern civilization corrupted by slavery. It recommended activities that family members could perform in order to aid the Union cause.[80]\\r\\nHistorian Stephen M. Frank reports that what it meant to be a father varied with status and age. He says most men demonstrated dual commitments as providers and nurturers and believed that husband and wife had mutual obligations toward their children. The war privileged masculinity, dramatizing and exaggerating, father-son bonds. Especially at five critical stages in the soldier's career (enlistment, blooding, mustering out, wounding and death) letters from absent fathers articulated a distinctive set of 19th-century ideals of manliness.[81]\\r\\nThere were numerous children's magazines such as Merry's Museum, The Student and Schoolmate, Our Young Folks, The Little Pilgrim, Forrester's Playmate, and The Little Corporal. They showed a Protestant religious tone and \\"promoted the principles of hard work, obedience, generosity, humility, and piety; trumpeted the benefits of family cohesion; and furnished mild adventure stories, innocent entertainment, and instruction\\".[82] Their pages featured factual information and anecdotes about the war along with related quizzes, games, poems, songs, short oratorical pieces for \\"declamation\\", short stories and very short plays that children could stage. They promoted patriotism and the Union war aims, fostered kindly attitudes toward freed slaves, blackened the Confederates cause, encouraged readers to raise money for war-related humanitarian funds, and dealt with the death of family members.[83] By 1866, the Milton Bradley Company was selling \\"The Myriopticon: A Historical Panorama of the Rebellion\\" that allowed children to stage a neighborhood show that would explain the war. It comprised colorful drawings that were turned on wheels and included pre-printed tickets, poster advertisements, and narration that could be read aloud at the show.[84]\\r\\nCaring for war orphans was an important function for local organizations as well as state and local government.[85] A typical state was Iowa, where the private \\"Iowa Soldiers Orphans Home Association\\" operated with funding from the legislature and public donations. It set up orphanages in Davenport, Glenwood and Cedar Falls. The state government funded pensions for the widows and children of soldiers.[86] Orphan schools like the Pennsylvania Soldiers' Orphan School, also spoke of the broader public welfare experiment that began as part of the aftermath of the Civil War. These orphan schools were created to provide housing, care, and education for orphans of Civil War soldiers. They became a matter of state pride, with orphans were paraded around at rallies to display the power of a patriotic schooling.[87]\\r\\nAll the northern states had free public school systems before the war but not the border states. West Virginia set up its system in 1863. Over bitter opposition it established an almost-equal education for black children, most of whom were ex-slaves.[88] Thousands of black refugees poured into St. Louis, where the Freedmen's Relief Society, the Ladies Union Aid Society, the Western Sanitary Commission, and the American Missionary Association (AMA) set up schools for their children.[89]\\r\\nPeople loyal to the U.S. federal government and opposed to secession living in the border states (where slavery was legal in 1861) were termed Unionists. Confederates sometimes styled them \\"Homemade Yankees\\". However, Southern Unionists were not necessarily northern sympathizers and many of them, although opposing secession, supported the Confederacy once it was a fact. East Tennessee never supported the Confederacy, and Unionists there became powerful state leaders, including governors Andrew Johnson and William G. Brownlow. Likewise, large pockets of eastern Kentucky were Unionist and helped keep the state from seceding.[90] Western Virginia, with few slaves and some industry, was so strongly Unionist that it broke away and formed the new state of West Virginia.[91]\\r\\nStill, nearly 120,000 Unionists from the South served in the Union Army during the Civil War and Unionist regiments were raised from every Confederate state except South Carolina. Among such units was the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment, which served as William Sherman's personal escort on his march to the sea. Southern Unionists were extensively used as anti-guerrilla paramilitary forces.[92] During Reconstruction many of these Unionists became \\"Scalawags\\", a derogatory term for Southern supporters of the Republican Party.[93]\\r\\nBesides organized military conflict, the border states were beset by guerrilla warfare. In such a bitterly divided state, neighbors frequently used the excuse of war to settle personal grudges and took up arms against neighbors.\\r\\nMissouri was the scene of over 1000 engagements between Union and Confederate forces, and uncounted numbers of guerrilla attacks and raids by informal pro-Confederate bands.[94] Western Missouri was the scene of brutal guerrilla warfare during the Civil War. Roving insurgent bands such as Quantrill's Raiders and the men of Bloody Bill Anderson terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements. Because of the widespread attacks and the protection offered by Confederate sympathizers, Federal leaders issued General Order No. 11 in 1863, and evacuated areas of Jackson, Cass, and Bates counties. They forced the residents out to reduce support for the guerrillas. Union cavalry could sweep through and track down Confederate guerrillas, who no longer had places to hide and people and infrastructure to support them. On short notice, the army forced almost 20,000 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, to leave their homes. Many never returned and the affected counties were economically devastated for years after the end of the war.[95] Families passed along stories of their bitter experiences down through several generations ÿ Harry Truman's grandparents were caught up in the raids and he would tell of how they were kept in concentration camps.[96]\\r\\nSome marauding units became organized criminal gangs after the war. In 1882, the bank robber and ex-Confederate guerrilla Jesse James was killed in Saint Joseph. Vigilante groups appeared in remote areas where law enforcement was weak, to deal with the lawlessness left over from the guerrilla warfare phase. For example, the Bald Knobbers were the term for several law-and-order vigilante groups in the Ozarks. In some cases, they too turned to illegal gang activity.[97]\\r\\nIn response to the growing problem of locally organized guerrilla campaigns throughout 1863 and 1864, in June 1864, Maj. Gen. Stephen G. Burbridge was given command over the state of Kentucky. This began an extended period of military control that would last through early 1865, beginning with martial law authorized by President Abraham Lincoln. To pacify Kentucky, Burbridge rigorously suppressed disloyalty and used economic pressure as coercion. His guerrilla policy, which included public execution of four guerrillas for the death of each unarmed Union citizen, caused the most controversy. After a falling out with Governor Thomas E. Bramlette, Burbridge was dismissed in February 1865. Confederates remembered him as the \\"Butcher of Kentucky\\".[98]\\r\\nList of Wikipedia articles on Union states and major cities:\\r\\n* Border states with slavery in 1861\\r\\n?Had two state governments, one Unionist one Confederate, both claiming to be the legitimate government of their state.

He became Prince of Orange as heir apparent upon his mother's accession as Queen on 30 April 1980, and succeeded her following her abdication on 30 April 2013. He went to public primary and secondary schools, served in the Royal Netherlands Navy, and studied history at Leiden University.

Until his accession to the throne, he was a member of the International Olympic Committee (1998ÿ2013),[1] chairman of the Advisory Committee on Water to the Dutch Minister of Infrastructure and the Environment (2004ÿ2013),[2] and chairman of the Secretary-General of the United Nations' Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation (2006ÿ2013).[3][4] At the age of 51, he is currently the second youngest monarch in Europe after Felipe VI of Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWillem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand was born on 27 April 1967 in the Utrecht University Hospital, Now the University Medical Center Utrecht in Utrecht, Netherlands. He is the first child of Princess Beatrix and Prince Claus,[5] and the first grandchild of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard. He was the first male Dutch royal baby since the birth of Prince Alexander in 1851, and the first immediate male heir since Alexander's death in 1884.\\r\\nFrom birth, Willem-Alexander has held the titles Prince of the Netherlands (Dutch: Prins der Nederlanden), Prince of Orange-Nassau (Dutch: Prins van Oranje-Nassau), and Jonkheer of Amsberg (Dutch: Jonkheer van Amsberg).[5] He was baptised as a member of the Dutch Reformed Church[6] on 2 September 1967[7] in Saint Jacob's Church in The Hague.[8] His godparents are Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, G?sta Freiin von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen, Ferdinand von Bismarck, former Prime Minister Jelle Zijlstra, Jonkvrouw Rene R?ell, and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.[7]\\r\\nHe had two younger brothers: Prince Friso (1968ÿ2013) and Prince Constantijn (born in 1969). He lived with his family at the castle Drakensteyn in the hamlet Lage Vuursche near Baarn from his birth until 1981, when they moved to the larger palace Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. His mother Beatrix became Queen of the Netherlands in 1980, after his grandmother Juliana abdicated. He then received the title of Prince of Orange as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.[5]\\r\\nWillem-Alexander attended Nieuwe Baarnse Elementary School in Baarn from 1973 to 1979. He went to three different secondary schools: the Baarns Lyceum in Baarn from 1979 to 1981, the Eerste Vrijzinnig Christelijk Lyceum in The Hague from 1981 to 1983, and the United World College of the Atlantic in Wales, the UK (1983 to 1985), from which he received his International Baccalaureate.[5][9]\\r\\nAfter his military service from 1985 to 1987, Willem-Alexander studied History at Leiden University from 1987 onwards and received his MA degree (doctorandus) in 1993.[10][11] His final thesis was on the Dutch response to France's decision under President Charles de Gaulle to leave the NATO's integrated command structure.[5]\\r\\nWillem-Alexander speaks English, Spanish, French and German in addition to his native Dutch.[12]\\r\\nBetween secondary school and his university education, Willem-Alexander performed military service in the Royal Netherlands Navy from August 1985 until January 1987. He received his training at the Royal Netherlands Naval College and the frigates HNLMS Tromp and HNLMS Abraham Crijnssen, where he was an ensign. In 1988 he received additional training at the ship HNLMS Van Kinsbergen and became a lieutenant (junior grade) (wachtofficier).[13]\\r\\nAs a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Navy, Willem-Alexander was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in 1995, Commander in 1997, Captain at Sea in 2001, and Commodore in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Army, he was made a Major (Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment) in 1995, and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1997, Colonel in 2001, and Brigadier General in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Air Force, he was made Squadron Leader in 1995 and promoted to Air Commodore in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Marechaussee, he was made Brigadier General in 2005.[9]\\r\\nBefore his investiture as king in 2013, Willem-Alexander was honorably discharged from the armed forces. The government declared that the head of state cannot be a serving member of the armed forces, since the government itself holds supreme command over the armed forces. As king, Willem-Alexander may choose to wear a military uniform with royal insignia, but not with his former rank insignia.[14]\\r\\nSince 1985, when he became 18 years old, Willem-Alexander has been a member of the Council of State of the Netherlands. This is the highest council of the Dutch government and is chaired by the head of state (then Queen Beatrix).[15]\\r\\nKing Willem-Alexander is interested in water management and sports issues. He was an honorary member of the World Commission on Water for the 21st century and patron of the Global Water Partnership, a body established by the World Bank, the UN, and the Swedish Ministry of Development. He was appointed as the Chairperson of the United Nations Secretary General's Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation on 12 December 2006.[16]\\r\\nOn 10 October 2010, Willem-Alexander and Mxima went to the Netherlands Antilles' capital, Willemstad, to attend and represent his mother, the Queen, at the Antillean Dissolution ceremony.\\r\\nHe was a patron of the Dutch Olympic Games Committee until 1998 when he was made a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). After becoming King, he relinquished his membership and received the Gold Olympic Order at the 125th IOC Session.[17] To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1928 Summer Olympics held in Amsterdam, he has expressed support to bid for the 2028 Summer Olympics.[18]\\r\\nHe was a member of the supervisory board of De Nederlandsche Bank (the Dutch central bank), a member of the Advisory Council of ECP (the information society forum for government, business and civil society), patron of Veterans' Day and held several other patronages and posts.[19]\\r\\nOn 28 January 2013, Beatrix announced her intention of abdicating. On the morning of 30 April, Beatrix signed the instrument of abdication at the Moseszaal (Moses Hall) at the Royal Palace of Amsterdam. Later that afternoon, Willem-Alexander was inaugurated as king in front of the joint assembly of the States General in a ceremony held at the Nieuwe Kerk.\\r\\nAs king, Willem-Alexander has weekly meetings with the prime minister and speaks regularly with ministers and state secretaries. He also signs all new Acts of Parliament and royal decrees. He represents the kingdom at home and abroad. At the State Opening of Parliament, he delivers the Speech from the Throne, which announces the plans of the government for the parliamentary year. The Constitution requires that the king appoint, dismiss and swear in all government ministers and state secretaries. As king, he is also the president of the Council of State, an advisory body that reviews proposed legislation. In modern practice, the monarch seldom chairs council meetings.[20]\\r\\nAt his accession at age 46, he was Europe's youngest monarch. On the inauguration of Spain's Felipe VI on 19 June 2014 he became, and remains, Europe's second-youngest monarch. He is also the first male monarch of the Netherlands since the death of his great-great-grandfather William III in 1890. Willem-Alexander was one of four new monarchs to take the throne in 2013 along with Pope Francis, the Emir Tamim bin Hamad of Qatar, and King Philippe of Belgium.\\r\\nWillem-Alexander is an avid pilot and has said that if he had not been a royal, he would have liked to be an airline pilot so he could fly big planes such as the Boeing 747.[21] During the reign of his mother, he regularly flew the Dutch royal airplane on trips.[22]\\r\\nIn May 2017, Willem-Alexander revealed that he had served as a co-pilot on KLM flights for 21 years, flying KLM Cityhopper's Fokker 70s twice a month, even after his ascension to the throne. With KLM's phased retirement of the Fokker 70, he began training to fly Boeing 737s. Willem-Alexander was rarely recognized while in the KLM uniform and wearing the KLM cap, though a few passengers had recognized his voice, even though he never gave his name and only welcomed passengers on behalf of the captain and crew.[23][21]\\r\\nUsing the name \\"W. A. van Buren\\", one of the least-known titles of the House of Orange-Nassau, he participated in the 1986 Frisian Elfstedentocht, a 200 kilometres (120?mi) long distance ice skating tour.[24] He ran the New York City Marathon under the same pseudonym in 1992.[25] Willem-Alexander completed both events.\\r\\nOn 2 February 2002, he married Mxima Zorreguieta Cerruti at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. Mxima is an Argentine woman of Basque, Portuguese and Italian ancestry, who prior to their marriage worked as an investment banker in New York City. The marriage triggered significant controversy due to the role the bride's father, Jorge Zorreguieta, had in the Argentinian military dictatorship. The couple have three daughters:\\r\\nIn an attempt to strike a balance between privacy for the royal family and availability to the press, the Netherlands Government Information Service (RVD) instituted a media code on 21 June 2005 which essentially states that:[26]\\r\\nDuring a ski vacation in Argentina, several photographs were taken of the prince and his family during the private part of their holiday, including one by Associated Press staff photographer Natacha Pisarenko, in spite of the media code, and after a photo opportunity had been provided earlier.[27] The Associated Press decided to publish some of the photos, which were subsequently republished by several Dutch media. Willem-Alexander and the RVD jointly filed suit against the Associated Press on 5 August 2009, and the trial started on 14 August at the district court in Amsterdam. On 28 August, the district court ruled in favour of the prince and RVD, citing that the couple has a right to privacy; that the pictures in question add nothing to any public debate; and that they are not of any particular value to society since they are not photographs of his family \\"at work\\". Associated Press was sentenced to stop further publication of the photographs, on pain of a ?1,000 fine per violation with a ?50,000 maximum.[28]\\r\\nThe royal family currently lives in Villa Eikenhorst on the De Horsten estate in Wassenaar. After the move of Princess Beatrix to the castle of Drakensteyn and a renovation, Willem-Alexander and his family moved to the palace of Huis ten Bosch in The Hague.[29]\\r\\nWillem-Alexander has a villa near Kranidi, Greece. Former actor Sean Connery has his own house nearby.[30]\\r\\nOn 10 July 2008, the Prince of Orange and Princess Maxima announced that they had invested in a development project on the Mozambican peninsula of Machangulo.[31] The development project was aimed at building an ecologically responsible vacation resort, including a hotel and several luxury vacation houses for investors. The project was to invest heavily in the local economy of the peninsula (building schools and a local clinic) with an eye both towards responsible sustainability and maintaining a local staff.[32] After contacting Mozambican President Armando Guebuza to verify that the Mozambican government had no objections, the couple decided to invest in two villas.[33] In 2009, controversy erupted in parliament and the press about the project and the prince's involvement.[33] Politician Alexander Pechtold questioned the morality of building such a resort in a poor country like Mozambique. After public and parliamentary controversy the royal couple announced that they decided to sell the property in Machangulo once their house was completed.[34] In January 2012, it was confirmed that the villa had been sold.[35]\\r\\nHis style and title, as appearing in preambles, is: \\"Willem-Alexander, by the Grace of God, King of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau, etc. etc. etc.\\" The triple 'etc.' refers to the Dutch monarch's other titles.\\r\\nWillem-Alexander is the first Dutch king since Willem III, who died in 1890. Willem-Alexander had earlier indicated that when he became king, he would take the name Willem IV,[36] but it was announced on 28 January 2013 that his regnal name would be Willem-Alexander.[37]\\r\\nThrough his father, a member of the House of Amsberg, he is descended from families of the lower German nobility, and through his mother, from several royal German/Dutch families such as the House of Lippe, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the House of Orange-Nassau, Waldeck and Pyrmont, and the House of Hohenzollern. He is descended from the first King of the Netherlands, William I of the Netherlands, who was also a ruler in Luxembourg and several German states, and all subsequent Dutch monarchs. By his mother, Willem-Alexander also descended from Paul I of Russia and thus from German princess Catherine the Great. Through his father, he is also descended from several Dutch/Flemish families who left the Low Countries during Spanish rule, such as the Berenbergs. His paternal great-great-grandfather Gabriel von Amsberg (1822ÿ1895), a Major-General of Mecklenburg, was recognized as noble as late as 1891, the family having adopted the \\"von\\" in 1795.[52][53]\\r\\nKing Willem-Alexander is a descendant of King George II and more relevant for his succession rights of his granddaughter Princess Augusta of Great Britain. Under the British Act of Settlement, King Willem-Alexander temporarily forfeited his (distant) succession rights to the throne of the United Kingdom by marrying a Roman Catholic. This right has since been restored in 2015 under the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.[54]\\r\\nHe is King of the Netherlands because he represents the most direct descendant of the brother of William the Silent, the leader of the Dutch Independence movement, acceptable to the citizens of the Netherlands.","input":"Who is the current ruler of the netherlands?"},{"output":"Mount Everest","context":"Overall, the Himalayan mountain system is the world's highest, and is home to 10 of 14 of the world's highest peaks, the Eight-thousanders, and a further 50 peaks over There over 50 Himalayan peaks with elevation over 7,000 metres (23,000?ft).

Under the global jurisdiction of FIFA and governed in Asia by the AFC, the team is also part of the South Asian Football Federation. The team, which was once considered one of the best teams in Asia, had its golden era during the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, under the coaching of Syed Abdul Rahim, India won gold during the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games, while finishing fourth during the 1956 Summer Olympics.\\r\\nIndia have never participated in the FIFA World Cup, though the team did qualify for the World Cup in 1950 after all the other nations in their qualification group withdrew. However, India themselves withdrew prior to the tournament beginning. The team has also appeared three times in the Asia's top football competition, the AFC Asian Cup. Their best result in the continental tournament occurred in 1964 when the team finished as runners-up. India also participate in the SAFF Championship, the top regional football competition in South Asia. They have won the tournament six times since the tournament began in 1993.\\r\\nDespite India not reaching the same heights since their golden era, the team has seen a steady resurgence since the beginning of the twenty-first century. Besides the SAFF Championship triumphs, under the guidance of Bob Houghton, India won the restarted Nehru Cup in 2007 and 2009 while also managing to emerge victorious during the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup. The Challenge Cup victory allowed India to once again qualify for the Asian Cup for the first time in 27 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFootball teams consisting of entirely Indian players started to tour Australia, Japan, Indonesia, and Thailand during the late 1930s.[7] After the success of several Indian football clubs abroad, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) was formed in 1937. The national team played their first match as an independent nation in 1948 in the first round of the 1948 Summer Olympics against France. Using mainly barefooted players, India were defeated 2ÿ1 in London.[7]\\r\\nIn 1950, India managed to qualify for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, which was scheduled to take place in Brazil.[8] This was due to all their opponents during qualifying withdrawing from the pre-tournament qualifiers.[8] However, India themselves withdrew from the World Cup before the tournament was to begin. The All India Football Federation gave various reasons for the team's withdrawal, including travel costs, lack of practice time, and valuing the Olympics more than the World Cup.[8]\\r\\nDespite the reason given out from the AIFF, many historians and pundits believe India withdrew from the World Cup due to FIFA imposing a rule banning players from playing barefoot.[9][10] However, according to the then captain of India, Sailen Manna, the story of the team not being allowed to play due to wanting to play barefoot was not true and was just an excuse to cover up the real reasons the AIFF decided not to travel to Brazil.[8] Since then, India has not come close to qualifying for another World Cup.[11]\\r\\nDespite not participating in the World Cup in 1950, the following years after, from 1951 to 1964, are usually considered to be the \\"golden era\\" of Indian football. India, coached by Hyderabad City Police head coach Syed Abdul Rahim, became one of the best teams in Asia.[12] In March 1951, Rahim lead India to their first ever triumph during the 1951 Asian Games. Hosted in India, the team defeated Iran 1ÿ0 in the gold medal match to gain their first trophy.[13] Sahu Mewalal scored the winning goal for India in that match.[13] The next year India went back to the Olympics but were once again defeated in the first round, this time by Yugoslavia and by a score of 10ÿ1.[14] Upon returning to India, the AIFF made it mandatory for footballers to wear boots.[7] After taking the defeat in Finland, India participated in various minor tournaments, such as the Colombo Cup, which they won three times from 1953 to 1955.[15]\\r\\nIn 1954, India returned to the Asian Games as defending champions in Manila. Despite their achievement three years prior, India were unable to go past the group stage as the team finished second in Group C during the tournament, two points behind Indonesia.[16] Two years later, during the 1956 Summer Olympics, India went on to achieve what is still considered the team's greatest result. The team finished in fourth place during the Summer Olympics football tournament, losing the bronze-medal match to Bulgaria 3ÿ0.[17] The tournament is also known for Neville D'Souza's hat-trick against Australia in the quarterfinals. D'Souza's hat-trick was the first hat-trick scored by an Asian in Olympic history.[17]\\r\\nAfter their good performance during the Summer Olympics, India participated in the 1958 Asian Games in Tokyo. The team once again finished fourth, losing the bronze-medal match to Indonesia 4ÿ1.[18] The next year the team traveled to Malaysia where they took part in the Merdeka Cup and finished as the tournament runners-up.[19]\\r\\nIndia began the 1960s with 1960 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. Despite the qualifiers for the West Zone being held in Kochi, India finished last in their qualification group and thus failed to qualify for the tournament.[20] Despite the set-back, India went on to win the gold medal during the Asian Games for the second time in 1962. The team defeated South Korea 2ÿ1 to win their second major championship.[21]\\r\\nTwo years later, following their Asian Games triumph, India participated in the 1964 AFC Asian Cup after all the other teams in their qualification group withdrew. Despite their automatic entry into the continental tournament, India managed to finish as the runners-up during the tournament, losing out to the hosts, Israel, by two points. This remains India's best performance in the AFC Asian Cup.[22]\\r\\nIndia returned to the Asian Games in 1966. Despite their performance two years prior during the AFC Asian Cup, India could not go beyond the group stage as the team finished third, behind Japan and Iran.[23] Four years later, during the 1970 Asian Games, India came back and took third place during the tournament. The team defeated Japan 1ÿ0 during the bronze-medal match.[24]\\r\\nIn 1974, India's performance in the Asian Games once again sharply declined as they finished the 1974 edition in last place in their group, losing all three matches, scoring two, and conceding 14 goals in the first round.[25] India then showed steady improvement during the 1978 tournament, finishing second in their group of three. The team were then knocked-out in the next round, finishing last in their group with three defeats from three matches.[26] The 1982 tournament proved to be better for India as the side managed to qualify for the quarter-finals before losing to Saudi Arabia 1ÿ0.[27]\\r\\nIn 1984, India managed to qualify for the AFC Asian Cup for the first time since their second place triumph in 1964. During the 1984 tournament, India finished in last place in their five team group in the first round.[28] India's only non-defeat during the tournament came against Iran, a 0ÿ0 draw.[28]\\r\\nDespite India's decline from a major football power in Asia, the team still managed to assert its dominance as the top team in South Asia. India managed to win the football competition of the South Asian Games in 1985 and then again won the gold medal in 1987.[29] The team then began the 1990s by winning the inaugural SAFF Championship in 1993.[30] The team ended the 21st century by winning the SAFF Championship again in 1997 and 1999.[30]\\r\\nIndia's first competitive matches of the 21st century were the 2002 FIFA World Cup first round qualifiers. Despite a very bright start, defeating the United Arab Emirates 1ÿ0, drawing Yemen 1ÿ1, as well as two victories over Brunei, including a 5ÿ0 victory in Bangalore, India finished a point away from qualification for the next round.[31] In 2003, India took part in the 2003 SAFF Championship. The team qualified for the semi-finals but fell to Bangladesh 2ÿ1.[32]\\r\\nLater in 2003, India participated in the Afro-Asian Games being held in Hyderabad. Under the coaching of Stephen Constantine, India managed to make it to the final of the tournament after defeating Zimbabwe, a team ranked 85 places above India in the FIFA rankings at the time, 5ÿ3.[33] Despite the major victory, during the gold-medal match India were defeated 1ÿ0 by Uzbekistan U21.[34] Due to this achievement, Constantine was voted as the Asian Football Confederation's Manager of the Month for October 2003. The tournament result also gave India more recognition around the country and around the world.[33]\\r\\nConstantine was replaced by Syed Nayeemuddin in 2005 but the Indian head coach only lasted for a little over a year as India suffered many heavy defeats during the 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers.[35] During this time India were defeated 6ÿ0 by Japan, 3ÿ0 by Saudi Arabia and Yemen respectively at home, and 7ÿ1 away in Jeddah.[36] Former Malm? and China coach Bob Houghton was brought in as head coach in May 2006.[37]\\r\\nUnder Houghton, India witnessed massive improvement in their football standing. In August 2007, Houghton won the country the restarted Nehru Cup after India defeated Syria 1ÿ0 in the final.[38] Pappachen Pradeep scored the winning goal for India that match. The next year, Houghton lead India during the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup, which was hosted in Hyderabad and Delhi. During the tournament, India breezed through the group stage before defeating Myanmar in the semi-finals. In the final against Tajikistan, India, through a Sunil Chhetri hat-trick, won the match 4ÿ1. The victory not only earned India the championship but it also allowed India to qualify for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, the nation's first Asian Cup appearance in 27 years.[39] In order to prepare for the Asian Cup, Houghton had the team stay together as a squad for eight months from June 2010 till the start of the tournament, meaning the players would not play for their clubs.[40]\\r\\nIndia were drawn into Group C for the Asian Cup with Australia, South Korea, and Bahrain.[41] Despite staying together as a team for eight months, India lost all three of their matches during the Asian Cup, including a 4ÿ0 defeat to Australia.[42] Despite the results, India were still praised by fans and pundits for their valiant efforts during the tournament.[42]\\r\\nAfter participating the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, India's quest to qualify for the 2015 edition of the tournament began in February 2011 with AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers. Bob Houghton decided to change the makeup of the India squad, replacing many of the aging players from the Asian Cup with some young players from the AIFF development side in the I-League, Indian Arrows.[43] Even with a young side, India managed to qualify for the AFC Challenge Cup with ease.[44] Despite the good result though with a young side, the AIFF decided to terminate the contract of Bob Houghton.[45]\\r\\nAfter having Dempo coach, Armando Colaco, as interim head coach, the AIFF signed Savio Medeira as head coach in October 2011.[46] Despite leading India to another SAFF Championship victory, Medeira lead India to their worst performance in the AFC Challenge Cup in March 2012. The team lost all three of their group matches, unable to score a single goal during the tournament.[47] After the tournament, Medeira was replaced as head coach by Dutchman, Wim Koevermans.[48] Koeverman's first job as head coach was the 2012 Nehru Cup. India won their third successive Nehru Cup, defeating Cameroon's B side on penalties.[49]\\r\\nIn March 2013, India failed to qualify for the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup and thus also failed to qualify for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.[50] The team also failed to retain the SAFF Championship, losing 2ÿ0 to Afghanistan in the 2013 final.[51] After more bad results in friendlies, Koevermans resigned as head coach in October 2014.[52]\\r\\nBy March 2015, after not playing any matches, India reached their lowest FIFA ranking position of 173.[53] A couple months prior, Stephen Constantine was re-hired as the head coach after first leading India more than a decade before.[54] Constantine's first major assignment back as the India head coach were the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. After making it through the first round of qualifiers, India crashed out during the second round, losing seven of their eight matches and thus, once again, failed to qualify for the World Cup.[55]\\r\\nThe following 34 players were called up prior to the 2017 Hero Tri-Nation Series matches, as well as the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Macau.[56]\\r\\nCaps and goals are updated as of 26 August 2017 after the match against Saint Kitts and Nevis.\\r\\nThe following players have also been called up to the India squad within the last twelve months.\\r\\nFor all past match results of the national team, see the team's results page.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia have never participated in a FIFA World Cup.[57] After gaining independence in 1947, India managed to qualify for the World Cup held in 1950. This was due to Myanmar, Indonesia, and the Philippines withdrawing from qualification.[57] However, prior to the start of the tournament, India themselves withdrew due to the expenses required in getting the team to Brazil.[57] Other reasons cited for why India withdrew include FIFA not allowing Indian players to play in the tournament barefoot and the All India Football Federation not considering the World Cup an important tournament compared to the Olympics.[57]\\r\\nAfter withdrawing from the 1950 FIFA World Cup, India didn't enter the qualifying rounds of the tournament between 1954 and 1982.[58] Since the 1986 qualifiers, with the exception of the 1990 edition of the tournament, the team started to participate in qualifiers but have yet to qualify for the tournament again.[58]\\r\\nIndia have qualified for the AFC Asian Cup three times. The team played their first Asian Cup in 1964. During this tournament India finished as the runners-up, their best major tournament performance yet.[59] Since then India has failed to progress beyond the first round of the Asian Cup with their most recent participation being the 2011 Asian Cup.\\r\\nSince independence, there have been eighteen different head coaches for the India national team, with ten of them being foreign coaches. The most successful head coach for India was Syed Abdul Rahim, who lead India to gold in both the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games while also achieving a fourth-place finish during the 1956 Summer Olympics.[60] The most successful foreign head coach for India was Bob Houghton, who coached the side from 2006 to 2011.[61] With Houghton in charge, India won the Nehru Cup twice and the AFC Challenge Cup in 2008 which allowed India to participate in their first AFC Asian Cup for 27 years.[61]","input":"Who is the captain of the indian football team?"},{"output":"Chris Chittell","context":"Emmerdale (known as Emmerdale Farm until 1989) is a long-running British soap opera set in Emmerdale (known as Beckindale until 1994), a fictional village in the Yorkshire Dales. Created by Kevin Laffan, Emmerdale Farm was first broadcast on 16 October 1972. Produced by ITV Yorkshire, it has been filmed at their Leeds studio since its inception. The programme has been broadcast in every ITV region.\\r\\nThe series originally appeared during the afternoon until 1978, when it was moved to an early-evening time slot in most regions; London and Anglia followed during the mid-1980s. Until December 1988, Emmerdale took seasonal breaks; since then, it has been broadcast year-round.\\r\\nEpisodes air on ITV weekday evenings at 19:00, with a second Thursday episode at 20:00. The programme began broadcasting in high definition on 10 October 2011. Emmerdale is the United Kingdom's second-longest-running television soap opera (after ITV's Coronation Street), and attracts an average of five to seven million viewers per episode.\\r\\nOctober 2012 marked the 40th anniversary of the show. During that month, the show made a live episode to mark the anniversary.\\r\\nThe premise of Emmerdale Farm was similar to the BBC radio soap opera The Archers, focusing on a family, a farm and characters in a nearby village. The programme's farmyard filming was originally modelled on RT's The Riordans, an Irish soap opera which was broadcast from the mid-1960s to the end of the 1970s. The Riordans broke new ground for soap operas by being filmed largely outdoors (on a farm, owned on the programme by Tom and Mary Riordan) rather than in a studiothe usual practice of British and American soap operas. The programme pioneered farmyard location shooting, with farm animals and equipment. During the 1960s and 1970s, outdoor filming of television programmes with outdoor broadcast units (OBUs) was in its infancy due to higher costs and reliance on the weather. The Riordans' success demonstrated that a soap opera could be filmed largely outdoors, and Yorkshire Television sent people to its set in County Meath to see the programme's production firsthand.[3][4]\\r\\nEmmerdale has had a large number of characters since it began, with its cast gradually expanding in size. The programme has also had changing residences and businesses for its characters, including a bed-and-breakfast and a factory.\\r\\nThe Miffield estate was the largest employer in the village of Beckindale, 39 miles (63?km) from Bradford and 52 miles (84?km) from Leeds. Lord Miffield leased Emmerdale Farm, on the edge of the village, to the Sugden family during the 1850s in gratitude after Josh Sugden sacrificed his life for the earl's son in the Crimean War. Josh's grandson Joseph married Margaret Oldroyd and their son, Jacob, was born in January 1916. During the 1930s, Jacob Sugden purchased Emmerdale Farm. In 1945 he married Annie Pearson, daughter of farm labourer Sam Pearson. Margaret Sugden died in 1963, and Joseph died the following year.\\r\\nJacob Sugden ran the farm into the ground, drinking away its profits. The badly-maintained farm's future looked bleak at his death on 10 October 1972. He was survived by his wife Annie, two sons and a daughter: Jack, the eldest; Peggy and Joe, the youngest of the three. These characters formed the basis of Emmerdale Farm.\\r\\nCharacter types on Emmerdale have included \\"bad boys\\", such as Cain Dingle, Ross Barton, Carl King, Robert Sugden and Aaron Livesy; \\"bitches\\", such as Kim Tate, Charity Tate, Nicola King, Chrissie White, Kelly Windsor and Sadie King; \\"villains\\", such as Cameron Murray, Lachlan White, Steph Stokes, Rosemary King, Gordon Livesy and Sally Spode; caring characters, such as Laurel Potts, Emily Kirk, Lisa Dingle, Paddy Kirk and Ruby Haswell; sassy women, such as Chas Dingle, Val Pollard, Viv Hope, Rebecca White, Nicola King, Leyla Harding and Belle Dingle, and comedy characters such as Kerry Wyatt, Bernice Blackstock, David Metcalfe, Val Pollard, Seth Armstrong, Dan Spencer and Jimmy King. The show has had a number of matriarchs, including Diane Sugden, Viv Hope, Lisa Dingle, Annie Sugden and Moira Barton. Older characters in Emmerdale include Edna Birch, Betty Eagleton, Pearl Ladderbanks, Sandy Thomas, Seth Armstrong, Alan Turner, Sam Pearson, Lily Butterfield and Len Reynolds.\\r\\nThe first episode of Emmerdale Farm, aired on 16 October 1972, began with Jacob Sugden's funeral. Jacob upset the family when he left the farm to his eldest son, Jack, who left home at 18 in 1964 and had not returned. Jack appeared in the opening episode, avoiding the funeral and waiting for the Sugdens at Emmerdale Farm. Over the next few months Jack sold a share of the farm to Annie, Joe, Peggy and his grandfather, Sam Pearson. Emmerdale Farm Ltd was formed when Henry Wilks bought Sam's share of the estate. The first episode, along with the others, have been repeated and released on a variety of media.[5]\\r\\nCharacters introduced in the first episode were:\\r\\nThe show's focus, initially on the farm and the Sugden family, moved to the nearby village of Beckindale. Reflecting this change, on 14 November 1989 its title was changed to Emmerdale. Coinciding with the title change was the introduction of the Tate family. These changes and more exciting storylines and dramatic episodes, such as Pat Sugden's 1986 car crash and the 1988 Crossgill fire, gradually began to improve the soap's popularity under new executive producer Keith Richardson. Richardson produced the programme for 24 years, overseeing its transformation from a minor, daytime, rural drama into a major UK soap opera.[6] The Windsor family arrived in 1993.\\r\\nBy 1993 Emmerdale was beginning its third decade on the air. In December of that year, one particular episode emerged as a major turning point for the show's history. Meant to evoke memories of the Lockerbie Disaster whose fifth anniversary was just nine days prior, the Emmerdale episode written for 30 December attracted its highest-ever audience (over 18?million) by featuring a plane crashing into the village, killing four people.[7] According to Nick Smurthwaite, the episode brought forth not just ratings but \\"complaints from aghast viewers.\\"[7] Nevertheless, the episode proved to be \\"brilliant television\\", as the highly-rated episode \\"allowed the writers to get rid of much dead wood, and reinvent the soap virtually from scratch\\", which included survivors changing the village name from Beckindale to Emmerdale.[7]\\r\\nEmmerdale had dramatic storylines for the rest of the 1990s and new long-term characters, such as the Dingle family, were introduced. The Tates became the soap's leading family during the decade, overshadowing the Sugdens and remaining at Home Farm for 16 years. Family members left or died and the last, Zoe, left in 2005. The early and mid-2000s included episodes with a storm (a similar, less-major storyline 10 years after the plane crash), a bus crash, the Kings River explosion, Sarah Sugden's death in a barn fire and the Sugden house fire (set in 2007 by Victoria Sugden, who was seeking the truth about her mother's death). It also saw the introduction of major long-term characters, including the King family and Cain and Charity Dingle (who left before returning in 2009).[8]\\r\\nIn 2009 the longest-tenured character, Jack Sugden, was killed off after the death of actor Clive Hornby (who had played Jack since 1980). Jack's funeral featured the first on-screen appearance in 13 years of Annie Sugden (Sheila Mercier). Early that year, executive producer Keith Richardson was replaced by former series producer Steve November (later replaced by John Whiston). Gavin Blyth became the series producer, followed by Stuart Blackburn after his death.\\r\\nEmmerdale celebrated its 40th anniversary on 16 October 2012. On 1 May 2012, it was announced that the show would have its first-ever live episode.[9] On 25 June 2012, it was announced that Tony Prescott, who directed the 50th anniversary live episode of Coronation Street in December 2010 would direct the episode.[10] On 23 July it was reported that an ITV2 backstage show, Emmerdale Uncovered: Live, would be broadcast after the live episode.[11] On 14 August, it was announced that the production team was building a new Woolpack set for the live episode. Although Emmerdale's village and interior sets are miles apart, its producers wanted The Woolpack to feature in the live episode.[12] On 31 August, it was announced that Emmerdale had created and filmed a live music festival with performances by Scouting for Girls and The Proclaimers.[13] On 6 September, it was confirmed that the One-hour live episode would include an unexpected death, two weddings and two births.[14]\\r\\nEmmerdale Live aired on 17 October 2012, in the middle of the 40th anniversary week, with the death revealed to be Carl King's. The story of Carl's death took the show into 2013, when a new series producer replaced Blackburn (who became producer of Coronation Street).\\r\\nAt the beginning of August 2015, Emmerdale introduced a new storyline: \\"Summer Fate\\", with the tagline \\"The choices we make are the paths we take. Who will meet their summer fate?\\". A promo for the storyline was released on 13 July. A disaster storyline had been rumoured, confirmed by the promo. The disaster was identified on 1 August, two days before the disaster week began, as a helicopter crash. The crash was triggered by an argument between Chrissie and Robert Sugden; Chrissie set Robert's car ablaze, causing exploding gas canisters to collide with a helicopter. The helicopter crashed into the village hall during Debbie Dingle and Pete Barton's wedding reception. Regular characters Ruby Haswell and Val Pollard were killed in the aftermath of the crash. Although Ross Barton was apparently murdered by his brother Pete, it was learned three weeks later that he survived.\\r\\nEmmerdale has featured a number of families, some defining an era of the show:\\r\\nThe Sugdens and their relatives, the Merricks and the Skilbecks, were at the centre of the show during the series' first two decades in the 1970s and 1980s (the Emmerdale Farm era). The Sugdens, owners of Emmerdale Farm, were its first family. Many of its members, and those of the Merrick and Skilbeck families, have left or been killed off since the mid-1990s.\\r\\nDecember 1984 saw the arrival of Caroline Bates; her teenage children, Kathy and Nick, followed in late 1985. Caroline left the show in 1989, returning for guest appearances in 1991, 1993-1994 and 1996. Nick was written out of the show when he was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1997. Kathy and her niece, Alice, remained in the village until late 2001; by then, Kathy had outlived two husbands. Through her, the Bateses are related to two of Emmerdale's central families: the Sugdens (through Jackie Merrick) and the Tates (through Chris Tate).\\r\\nSugdens remaining in the village include Jack's widow, Diane; his three children, Andy, Robert and Victoria Sugden; Andy's children Sarah and Jack (the latter born on the show's 40th anniversary), and Robert's ex-wife Chrissie. Other families followed: the middle-class Windsors in 1993 (known as the Hope family after Viv's 2001 remarriage to Bob Hope) and the ne'er-do-well Dingles in 1994.\\r\\nThe Tate, Windsor-Hope and Dingle families predominated during the 1990s and 2000s. The era's storylines included the 1993 plane crash, the 1994 Home Farm siege, the 1998 post-office robbery, the 2000 bus crash, the 2003ÿ04 storm and the 2006 King show-home collapse. By the mid- to late-2000s, the last of the Tates (Zoe, daughter Jean and nephew Joseph) had emigrated to New Zealand. In 2009, Chris Tate's ex-wife Charity and their son Noah returned to the village. Members of the Windsor-Hope family left the village in early 2006, and Viv Hope was killed off in a village fire in February 2011 after nearly 18 years on the show. As of 2015 only Donna Windsor's daughter, April, and the Hope branch of the family (Bob and his children, Carly and twins Cathy and Heathcliff) remain.\\r\\nThe King family arrived in 2004 (as the Tates departed), but many members have been killed off. In 2013, most of the Dingles remained. Their circumstances had changed in their two decades in the village; Chas Dingle owned half of The Woolpack and Marlon was a chef. As of 2014, the Dingles, Bartons and Whites are the central families; the Bartons are a farming family, and the Whites currently own Home Farm.\\r\\nOver the years, Emmerdale has highlighted a range of different social issues, including rape, cancer, miscarriage, dementia, homosexuality, arson, murder, HIV, sexual assault, post traumatic stress disorder, brain aneurysm, adultery, domestic violence, financial problems, embezzlement, sexual abuse, alcoholism, drug addiction, anorexia, teenage pregnancy, gambling addiction, bereavement, fraud, suicide, mesothelioma, schizophrenia, manslaughter, becoming a parent in later life, sudden infant death syndrome, self-harming, assisted suicide, epilepsy and premature births.\\r\\nAn average Emmerdale episode generally attracts 6ÿ8?million viewers, making it one of Britain's most popular television programmes. During the 1990s, the series had an average of 10ÿ11?million viewers per episode. On 30 December 1993, Emmerdale had its largest audience (18?million) when a plane crashed into the village. On 27 May 1997, 13?million viewers saw Frank Tate die of a heart attack after the return of wife Kim. On 20 October 1998, 12.5?million viewers saw The Woolpack explode after a fire.\\r\\nThe village storm on 1 January 2004 attracted 11.19?million viewers. 18 May 2004 episode in which Jack Sugden was shot by his adopted son, Andy, attracted 8.27?million viewers. On 17 March 2005, 9.39?million watched Shelly Williams fall from the Isle of Arran ferry. Zoe Tate left the show after 16 years on 22 September 2005 before 8.58 million viewers, marking her departure by blowing up Home Farm. On 13 July 2006, the Kings River house collapse was seen by 6.90?million viewers. Cain Dingle left on 21 September 2006, before an audience of 8.57?million viewers. On Christmas Day 2006, 7.69?million saw Tom King murdered on his wedding day. Billy Hopwood crashed his truck into a lake on 1 February 2007, attracting 8.15?million viewers. The end of the \\"Who Killed Tom King?\\" storyline on 17 May 2007, had an audience of 8.92 million.\\r\\nOn 14 January 2010, 9.96?million saw Mark Wylde shot dead by wife Natasha. Natasha's 27 October confession to daughter Maisie attracted an audience of nearly 8?million. On 13 January 2011, 9.15?million saw a fire kill Viv Hope and Terry Woods. The live 40th-anniversary episode on 17 October 2012, drew an audience of 8.83?million. On 16 October 2013, 8.37?million watched Cameron take the occupants of The Woolpack hostage and shoot Alicia. The next day, 9.28?million viewers saw Cameron Murray die.[15]\\r\\nLocation shooting was originally filmed in the village of Arncliffe in Littondale, a quiet valley in the Yorkshire Dales. The Falcon, the village hotel, served as the fictional Woolpack Inn. When the filming location became public it was moved to the village of Esholt in 1976, where it remained for 22 years.\\r\\nFilming returned to Esholt for a one off episode in 2016 for the Ashley Thomas dementia special which aired December 2016. The location was used to represent Ashley's onset of dementia to the viewer.\\r\\nThe original Emmerdale Farm buildings are near the village of Leathley. Creskeld Hall, in Arthington, (Home Farm). The buildings are one of the few original filming locations used for the entire series, and have been involved in many storylines.\\r\\nConstruction of a purpose-built set began on the Harewood estate in 1996, and it has been used since 1997. The first scenes filmed on the set (the front of The Woolpack) were broadcast on 17 February 1998. The Harewood set is a replica of Esholt, with minor alterations.\\r\\nThe Harewood houses are timber-framed and stone-faced. The village is built on green-belt land, with its buildings classified as \\"temporary structures\\" which must be demolished within ten years unless new planning permission is received. There is no plan to demolish the set, and a new planning application has been drawn up. The set includes a church and churchyard, where the characters who have died on the series are buried.\\r\\nButlers Farm is Brookland Farm, a working farm in the nearby village of Eccup. Farmyard and building exteriors are filmed at Brookland, with interior house shots filmed in the studio.\\r\\nLocation filming is also done in the City of Leeds and other West Yorkshire locations; the fictional market town of Hotten is Otley, 10 miles North West of Leeds. Benton Park School in Rawdon and the primary school in Farnley were also used for filming. Interiors are primarily filmed at Yorkshire Television's Emmerdale Production Centre in Leeds, next to Yorkshire's Leeds Studios.[16] As of 28 March 2011, HD-capable studios in the ITV Studios building were used for most of the interior scenes.\\r\\nFour farms have been featured on Emmerdale:\\r\\nEmmerdale's first sponsor (from 14 December 1999 to 20 February 2002) was Daz detergent, followed by Heinz Tomato Ketchup and Heinz salad cream from May 2003 to May 2005. Reckitt Benckiser took over until 2009, advertising Calgon, Air Wick, Veet, and Lemsip. Tombola Bingo underwrote the show from November 2009 to March 2012, followed by Bet365 Bingo until March 2014. McCain Foods began a two-year, S8 million sponsorship on 7 April 2014.[17]\\r\\nThe thirteen actors who have appeared in the series for 20 years or more are listed in the table below. The longest-tenured actor is Chris Chittell who has played Eric Pollard for 31 years. The longest-tenured actress is Sheila Mercier, who played Annie Sugden for 22 years.\\r\\nEmmerdale was first broadcast two afternoons a week in 1972, and it later moved to a 19:00 slot. The number of episodes has increased, to its current six half-hour episodes each week. Each episode is filmed two to four weeks before it is broadcast on ITV.\\r\\nEmmerdale reaches viewers in the Republic of Ireland via UTV Ireland, which broadcasts the series simultaneously with ITV in the UK with a live feed from London. Breaking news on ITV would interrupt the broadcast. Emmerdale was broadcast during the day on RT One from 1972 to 2001 before it moved to TV3. RT were several months behind; for many years, they broadcast the show five days a week (instead of ITV's three days a week) and took a break during the summer. As the series began a five-night week, RT fell behind the ITV broadcasts; the gap between RT One's last episode and TV3's first episode was about three months.[18]\\r\\nThe series has appeared in Sweden as Hem till g?rden (\\"Home to the Farm\\") since the 1970s?ÿ originally on TV2 and since 1994 on TV4. Two episodes are broadcast weekdays at 11:35. Emmerdale is the most-watched daytime non-news programme in Sweden, attracting 150,000 to 200,000 viewers daily.[19] Episodes are repeated overnight on TV4 and in prime time on digital channel TV4 Guld.\\r\\nThe programme appears in Finland on MTV3 on primetime, 17:55ÿ18:25 and 18:25ÿ18:55 Monday to Friday, two episodes a day, with repeats of each episode the following weekday morning between 9:00 and 11:00. Episodes originally aired in the UK in June and July 2016 were broadcast in Finland in March 2017. Emmerdale attracts an average of 350,000 to 450,000 viewers per episode, and is the most watched non-Finnish every-weekday program in Finnish television.[20]\\r\\nEmmerdale is broadcast in New Zealand weekdays on ONE, with an hour-long episode Monday to Thursday and a half-hour episode on Friday from 12:30 to 13:00. It is the second-most-watched daytime programme, after the news.[21] Episodes are broadcast a month behind ITV's.\\r\\nEmmerdale was broadcast in Australia for the first time in July 2006, when UKTV began airing the 2006 series with episode 4288.[22][23] As of April 2016, UKTV episodes are from July 2014, twenty one months behind the UK airings.","input":"Who is the longest running actor in emmerdale?"},{"output":"football","context":"","input":"What sports did jackie robinson play besides baseball?"},{"output":"George Louis","context":"There have been 12 monarchs of the Kingdom of Great Britain and the United Kingdom (see Monarchy of the United Kingdom) since the merger of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland on 1 May 1707.

Section 13-3108 subsection B prohibits any political subdivision of the state from enacting any laws requiring licensing or registration.[4] According to state law, a person must be 18 years of age to purchase any non-NFA firearm from any source; however, there is a federal age limit of 21 years on handgun purchases from federal firearms licensees.\\r\\nOn foot, any adult person who is not a \\"prohibited possessor\\"[5] may openly carry a loaded firearm visible to others. Generally, a person must be at least 18 years of age to possess or openly carry a firearm. However, this does not apply to:\\r\\nThe law does not expressly require openly carried weapons to be in a holster, case or scabbard; however, the open carrying of weapons not in a holster, case or scabbard while on foot in a populated area could be construed as reckless display or, if others feel threatened by such, even assault with a deadly weapon.\\r\\nIn a vehicle, any adult person who is not a prohibited possessor may openly carry a loaded firearm in a vehicle whether in a holster, case, compartment, or in plain view. Persons under 21 may openly carry a loaded or unloaded firearm in a vehicle only if it is in plain view, i.e. discernible from the ordinary observation of a person located outside and within the immediate vicinity of the vehicle.\\r\\nIn Arizona, anyone who is not prohibited from owning a firearm and is at least 21 years old can carry a concealed weapon without a permit as of July 29, 2010.[7] Arizona was the third state in modern U.S. history (after Vermont and Alaska, followed by Wyoming) to allow the carrying of concealed weapons without a permit, and it is the first state with a large urban population to do so.[8][9]\\r\\nArizona is classified as a \\"shall issue\\" state. Even though Arizona law allows concealed carry by adults without permit, concealed carry permits are still available and issued by the Concealed Weapons Permit Unit of the Arizona Department of Public Safety for purposes of reciprocity with other states or for carrying firearms in certain regulated places. Requirements for issuance include taking a training class (provided by a licensed third party) or hunter education class, submitting a finger print card, and paying a $60 fee. Applicants must be at least 21 years of age. New permits are valid for five years. [10] Renewing a permit requires only an application and finger print card. However, effective December 31, 2007 the finger print card requirement for renewal is scheduled to end.[11] Arizona recognizes all valid out-of-state carry permits.[12]\\r\\nThe Arizona legislature has largely preempted political subdivisions (counties, cities) to choose what laws that they want. Political subdivisions may regulate the carrying of weapons by juveniles or by their own employees or contractors when such employees or contractors are acting within the course and scope of their employment or contract. They may also bar the carrying of weapons at public establishments and events by those who do not have concealed carry permits. Public establishments and events where carry by non-permit holders is prohibited must provide secure storage for weapons on-site, which must be readily accessible upon entry and allow for immediate retrieval upon exit.[13]\\r\\nNative American reservations, which comprise over a quarter of the land area of the state,[14] may have gun laws identical to or more restrictive than state law.[15][16] Some tribal governments in Arizona may not recognize Arizona law on the concealed carrying of firearms without a permit while on tribal land.[16]\\r\\nAll Arizona tribes recognize federal law, including the \\"safe passage\\" provision of the federal Firearm Owners Protection Act Act (FOPA). FOPA provides that, notwithstanding any state, tribal, or local law, and while making a continuous journey, a person who is not a prohibited possessor is entitled to transport a firearm or ammunition for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm or ammunition if, during such transportation the firearm is unloaded, and neither the firearm nor any ammunition being transported is readily accessible or is directly accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting vehicle.[17] In vehicles without a trunk, the unloaded firearm or ammunition must be in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console.[17] Recent U.S. Court of Appellate rulings have confirmed that FOPA\`s protections only apply to unloaded firearms not readily accessible to the traveler, and many tribal governments have strict laws with respect to firearms being carried or transported on tribal lands.[17][18][18][19] For example, in the event of a vehicle stop, Navajo Nation police will seize any loaded firearm found to be accessible to the driver or passenger.[18][19][20] and confiscated firearms are not returnable unless the owner can establish proof of ownership of the firearm and ammunition by presenting a bill of sale or other evidence at the police station at a later date.[20]\\r\\nIt is generally illegal to discharge a firearm within or into the limits of any municipality. However, this prohibition does not apply to persons discharging firearms in the following circumstances:\\r\\nAccording to the Arizona Gun Owners Guide by Alan Korwin, while discharging a firearm using blanks within the limits of a municipality is not expressly prohibited by law, disturbing the peace (ARS 13-2904) or other charges could still apply.[22]\\r\\nState law prohibits the carrying of firearms in certain areas. These prohibited areas include:\\r\\nIn addition, political subdivisions have limited power to prohibit the carrying of firearms in certain areas as described above. Carrying a firearm at a jail, correctional facility, juvenile secure care facility, or in a hydroelectric or nuclear power generating station is a felony. Carrying a firearm in any other prohibited area, absent any other concomitant criminal conduct, is a misdemeanor. Carrying a firearm on private property or in a private establishment where it has been forbidden by the owner or another person having lawful control over the property is not expressly prohibited by law, but is held to constitute misdemeanor trespass.[23] Carrying a firearm at a public college or university where it has been prohibited by the governing board is not expressly prohibited by law, but is held to violate provisions of ARS 13-2911, which prohibits \\"interference with or disruption of an educational institution\\". The restrictions pertaining to licensed liquor establishments do not apply to liquor stores or other stores that sell only closed containers of alcohol for consumption off the premises.[24][25][26][27][28][29][30]\\r\\nState law prohibits the possession of firearms and other deadly weapons by certain categories of \\"prohibited possessors\\". According to current statute, these categories are defined as follows:\\r\\nNotably, the prohibition against owning a firearm by a person found to be a danger to himself or others or persistently or acutely disabled or gravely disabled continues in effect even after the expiration of the mental health court order itself (365 days). Instead, a person whose right to possess a firearm was forfeited as part of a mental health order must have that right judicially restored by filing a petition with the court requesting a hearing and a court order restoring the right to possess a firearm.[32]\\r\\nArizona appellate courts have ruled that ARS 1-244 bars the retroactive application of changes to the prohibited possessor statute unless there is an express legislative declaration of retroactive intent.[33] Although the statute has been amended numerous times during its history, no such retroactive declarations have ever been passed into law. Thus, the possession of deadly weapons by some individuals may be governed by older versions of the statute which are either more or less restrictive than the one currently in force. For example, persons found to constitute a danger to self or others or to be persistently or acutely disabled or gravely disabled prior to September 30, 2009 do not need to petition the courts for a restoration of rights, as statutes in effect prior to that date either did not prohibit their possession of deadly weapons or prohibited such possession only temporarily, during their term of court-ordered treatment.\\r\\nState law prohibits the possession certain types of firearms and other deadly weapons by any citizen.

It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed, or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts. The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples of circular motion include: an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth at a constant height, a fan's blades rotating around a hub, a stone which is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles, a car turning through a curve in a race track, an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, and a gear turning inside a mechanism.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the object's velocity vector is constantly changing direction, the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation.  Without this acceleration, the object would move in a straight line, according to Newton's laws of motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn physics, uniform circular motion describes the motion of a body traversing a circular path at constant speed. Since the body describes circular motion, its distance from the axis of rotation remains constant at all times. Though the body's speed is constant, its velocity is not constant: velocity, a vector quantity, depends on both the body's speed and its direction of travel. This changing velocity indicates the presence of an acceleration; this centripetal acceleration is of constant magnitude and directed at all times towards the axis of rotation. This acceleration is, in turn, produced by a centripetal force which is also constant in magnitude and directed towards the axis of rotation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of rotation around a fixed axis of a rigid body that is not negligibly small compared to the radius of the path, each particle of the body describes a uniform circular motion with the same angular velocity, but with velocity and acceleration varying with the position with respect to the axis.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor motion in a circle of radius r, the circumference of the circle is C = 2 r. If the period for one rotation is T, the angular rate of rotation, also known as angular velocity,  is:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speed of the object travelling the circle is:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe angle Ĳ swept out in a time t is:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe angular acceleration, ϫ, of the particle is:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of uniform circular motion, ϫ will be zero.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe acceleration due to change in the direction is:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe centripetal and centrifugal force can also be found out using acceleration:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vector relationships are shown in Figure 1. The axis of rotation is shown as a vector  perpendicular to the plane of the orbit and with a magnitude  = dĲ / dt. The direction of  is chosen using the right-hand rule.

Likewise, the acceleration is given by\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich is a vector perpendicular to both  and v(t) of magnitude  |v| = 2 r and directed exactly opposite to r(t).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the simplest case the speed, mass and radius are constant.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider a body of one kilogram, moving in a circle of radius one metre, with an angular velocity of one radian per second.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring circular motion the body moves on a curve that can be described in polar coordinate system as a fixed distance R from the center of the orbit taken as origin, oriented at an angle Ĳ(t) from some reference direction.

Consequently, the acceleration is:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe centripetal acceleration is the radial component, which is directed radially inward:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile the tangential component changes the magnitude of the velocity:\\r\\n\\r\\nCircular motion can be described using complex numbers.

Because the velocity v is tangent to the circular path, no two velocities point in the same direction. Although the object has a constant speed, its direction is always changing. This change in velocity is caused by an acceleration a, whose magnitude is (like that of the velocity) held constant, but whose direction also is always changing. The acceleration points radially inwards (centripetally) and is perpendicular to the velocity. This acceleration is known as centripetal acceleration.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a path of radius r, when an angle Ĳ is swept out, the distance travelled on the periphery of the orbit is s = rĲ. Therefore, the speed of travel around the orbit is \\r\\n\\r\\nwhere the  angular rate of rotation is . (By rearrangement,  = v/r.) Thus, v is a constant, and the velocity vector v also rotates with constant magnitude v, at the same angular rate .\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this case the three-acceleration vector is perpendicular to the three-velocity vector, \\r\\n\\r\\nand the square of proper acceleration, expressed as a scalar invariant, the same in all reference frames, \\r\\n\\r\\nbecomes the expression for circular motion,\\r\\n\\r\\nor, taking the positive square root and using the three-acceleration, we arrive at the proper acceleration for circular motion:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe left-hand circle in Figure 2 is the orbit showing the velocity vectors at two adjacent times. On the right, these two velocities are moved so their tails coincide. Because speed is constant, the velocity vectors on the right sweep out a circle as time advances.  For a swept angle dĲ =  dt the change in v is a vector at right angles to v and of magnitude v dĲ, which in turn means that the magnitude of the acceleration is given by\\r\\n\\r\\nIn non-uniform circular motion an object is moving in a circular path with a varying speed.  Since the speed is changing, there is tangential acceleration in addition to normal acceleration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn non-uniform circular motion the net acceleration (a) is along direction of v which is directed inside circle but does not pass through its center (see figure). The net acceleration may be resolved into two components: tangential acceleration and normal acceleration also known as the centripetal or radial acceleration. Unlike tangential acceleration, centripetal acceleration is present in both uniform and non-uniform circular motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn non-uniform circular motion, normal force does not always point in the opposite direction of weight.  Here is an example with an object traveling in a straight path then loops a loop back into a straight path again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis diagram shows the normal force pointing in other directions rather than opposite to the weight force.  The normal force is actually the sum of the radial and tangential forces. The component of weight force is responsible for the tangential force here (We have neglected frictional force). The radial force (centripetal force) is due the change in direction of velocity as discussed earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn non-uniform circular motion, normal force and weight may point in the same direction.  Both forces can point down, yet the object will remain in a circular path without falling straight down.  First lets see why normal force can point down in the first place.  In the first diagram, let's say the object is a person sitting inside a plane, the two forces point down only when it reaches the top of the circle.  The reason for this is that the normal force is the sum of the tangential force and centripetal force. The tangential force is zero at the top (as no work is performed when the motion is perpendicular to the direction of force applied. Here weight force is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the object at the top of the circle) and centripetal force points down, thus normal force will point down as well.  From a logical standpoint, a person who is travelling in the plane will be upside down at the top of the circle.  At that moment, the persons seat is actually pushing down on the person, which is the normal force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason why the object does not fall down when subjected to only downward forces is a simple one.  Think about what keeps an object up after it is thrown.  Once an object is thrown into the air, there is only the downward force of earths gravity that acts on the object.  That does not mean that once an object is thrown in the air, it will fall instantly.  What keeps that object up in the air is its velocity.  The first of Newton's laws of motion states that an objects inertia keeps it in motion, and since the object in the air has a velocity, it will tend to keep moving in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nA varying angular speed for an object moving in a circular path can also be achieved if the rotating body does not have an homogeneous mass distribution. For inhomogeneous objects, it is necessary to approach the problem as in.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolving applications dealing with non-uniform circular motion involves force analysis.  With uniform circular motion, the only force acting upon an object traveling in a circle is the centripetal force.  In non-uniform circular motion, there are additional forces acting on the object due to a non-zero tangential acceleration.  Although there are additional forces acting upon the object, the sum of all the forces acting on the object will have to equal to the centripetal force.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadial acceleration is used when calculating the total force.  Tangential acceleration is not used in calculating total force because it is not responsible for keeping the object in a circular path.  The only acceleration responsible for keeping an object moving in a circle is the radial acceleration.  Since the sum of all forces is the centripetal force, drawing centripetal force into a free body diagram is not necessary and usually not recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nF\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\ne\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\nF\\r\\n\\r\\nc\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle F_{net}=F_{c}\\\\,}\\r\\n\\r\\n, we can draw free body diagrams to list all the forces acting on an object then set it equal to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nF\\r\\n\\r\\nc\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle F_{c}\\\\,}\\r\\n\\r\\n.  Afterwards, we can solve for what ever is unknown (this can be mass, velocity, radius of curvature, coefficient of friction, normal force, etc.).  For example, the visual above showing an object at the top of a semicircle would be expressed as \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nF\\r\\n\\r\\nc\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\nn\\r\\n+\\r\\nm\\r\\ng\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle F_{c}=n+mg\\\\,}\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn uniform circular motion, total acceleration of an object in a circular path is equal to the radial acceleration.  Due to the presence of tangential acceleration in non uniform circular motion, that does not hold true any more.  To find the total acceleration of an object in non uniform circular, find the vector sum of the tangential acceleration and the radial acceleration.\\r\\n\\r\\nRadial acceleration is still equal to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nv\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle v^{2}/r}\\r\\n\\r\\n.

The Thirteen Colonies had very similar political, constitutional, and legal systems and were dominated by Protestant English-speakers. They were part of Britain's possessions in the New World, which also included colonies in Canada and the Caribbean, as well as East and West Florida.\\r\\nBetween 1625 and 1775, the colonial population grew from roughly 2000 to over 2 million, often displacing Native Americans. In the 18th century, the British government operated its colonies under a policy of mercantilism, in which the central government administered its possessions for the economic benefit of the mother country. During the colonial period, slavery was introduced. However, the Thirteen Colonies had a high degree of self-governance and active local elections, and they resisted London's demands for more control.\\r\\nThe French and Indian War (1754ÿ63) against France and its Indian allies led to greater tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. In the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with Britain. These inter-colonial activities cultivated a sense of shared American identity and led to calls for protection of the colonists' \\"Rights as Englishmen\\", especially the principle of \\"no taxation without representation\\". Grievances with the British government led to the American Revolution, in which the colonies collaborated in forming a Continental Congress which declared independence in 1776 and fought the American Revolutionary War (1775ÿ83) with the aid of France, the Dutch Republic, and Spain.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1606, King James I of England granted charters to both the Plymouth Company and the London Company for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in North America. The first permanently settled English colony on the North American continent was the Colony and Dominion of Virginia, established in 1607. The Plymouth Company did found the Popham Colony on the Kennebec River, but it was short-lived. The Plymouth Council for New England sponsored several colonization projects, culminating with Plymouth Colony, which was settled by the English Puritans who are known today as the Pilgrims.[3] The Dutch, Swedish, and French also established successful North American colonies at roughly the same time as the English, but they eventually came under the English crown. The 13 colonies were complete with the establishment of the Province of Georgia in 1732, although the term \\"Thirteen Colonies\\" became current only in the context of the American Revolution.[4]\\r\\nThe first successful English colony was Jamestown, established May 14, 1607 near Chesapeake Bay. The business venture was financed and coordinated by the London Virginia Company, a joint stock company looking for gold. Its first years were extremely difficult, with very high death rates from disease and starvation, wars with local Indians, and little gold. The colony survived and flourished by turning to tobacco as a cash crop.[5][6]\\r\\nIn 1632, King Charles I granted the charter for Province of Maryland to Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore. Calvert's father had been a prominent Catholic official who encouraged Catholic immigration to the English colonies. The charter offered no guidelines on religion.[7]\\r\\nThe Province of Carolina was the second attempted English settlement south of Virginia, the first being the failed attempt at Roanoke. It was a private venture, financed by a group of English Lords Proprietors who obtained a Royal Charter to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir John Colleton. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became Charleston, originally Charles Town for Charles II of England.[8]\\r\\nThe Pilgrims were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to physically distance themselves from the corrupt Church of England. After initially moving to the Netherlands, they decided to re-establish themselves in America. The initial Pilgrim settlers sailed to North America in 1620 on the Mayflower. Upon their arrival, they drew up the Mayflower Compact, by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small Plymouth Colony. William Bradford was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.[9]\\r\\nThe non-separatist Puritans constituted a much larger group than the Pilgrims, and they established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the Church of England by creating a new, pure church in the New World. By 1640, 20,000 had arrived; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the New Haven, Saybrook, and Connecticut colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.[10]\\r\\nProvidence Plantation was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams on land provided by Narragansett sachem Canonicus. Williams was a Puritan who preached religious tolerance, separation of Church and State, and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements, and he and other settlers founded Providence Plantation based on an egalitarian constitution providing for majority rule \\"in civil things\\" and \\"liberty of conscience\\" in religious matters.[5][11] In 1637, a second group including Anne Hutchinson established a second settlement on Aquidneck Island, also known as Rhode Island.\\r\\nOther colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in New Hampshire and Maine. These small settlements were absorbed by Massachusetts when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.\\r\\nIn 1685, King James II of England closed the legislatures and consolidated the New England colonies into the Dominion of New England, putting the region under firm royal control of Governor Edmund Andros. In 1688, the colonies of New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added to the dominion. Andros was overthrown and the dominion was closed in 1689, after the Glorious Revolution deposed King James II; the former colonies were re-established.[12] According to Guy Miller:\\r\\nBeginning in 1609, Dutch traders explored and established fur trading posts on the Hudson River, Delaware River, and Connecticut River, seeking to protect their interests in the fur trade. The Dutch West India Company established permanent settlements on the Hudson River, creating the Dutch colony of New Netherland. In 1626, Peter Minuit purchased the island of Manhattan from the Lenape Indians and established the outpost of New Amsterdam.[14] Relatively few Dutch settled in New Netherland, but the colony came to dominate the regional fur trade.[15] It also served as the base for extensive trade with the English colonies, and many products from New England and Virginia were carried to Europe on Dutch ships.[16] The Dutch also engaged in the burgeoning Atlantic slave trade, supplying enslaved Africans to the English colonies in North America and Barbados.[17] The West India Company desired to grow New Netherland as it became commercially successful, yet the colony failed to attract the same level of settlement as the English colonies did. Many of those who did immigrate to the colony were English, German, Walloon, or Sephardim.[18]\\r\\nIn 1638, Sweden established the colony of New Sweden in the Delaware Valley. The operation was led by former members of the Dutch West India Company, including Peter Minuit.[19] New Sweden established extensive trading contacts with English colonies to the south, and shipped much of the tobacco produced in Virginia.[20] The colony was conquered by the Dutch in 1655,[21] while Sweden was engaged in the Second Northern War.\\r\\nBeginning in the 1650s, the English and Dutch engaged in a series of wars, and the English sought to conquer New Netherland.[22] Richard Nicolls captured the lightly defended New Amsterdam in 1664, and his subordinates quickly captured the remainder of New Netherland.[23] The 1667 Treaty of Breda ended the Second Anglo-Dutch War and confirmed English control of the region.[24] The Dutch briefly regained control of parts of New Netherland in the Third Anglo-Dutch War, but surrendered claim to the territory in the 1674 Treaty of Westminster, ending the Dutch colonial presence in North America.[25]\\r\\nAfter the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the British renamed the colony \\"York City\\" or \\"New York\\". Large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between New York City and Albany, while people from New England started moving in as well as immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population.[26] In 1674, the proprietary colonies of East Jersey and West Jersey were created from lands formerly part of New York.[27]\\r\\nPennsylvania was founded in 1681 as a proprietary colony of Quaker William Penn. The main population elements included Quaker population based in Philadelphia, a Scotch Irish population on the Western frontier, and numerous German colonies in between.[28] Philadelphia became the largest city in the colonies with its central location, excellent port, and a population of about 30,000.[29]\\r\\nIn 1702, East and West Jersey were combined to form the Province of New Jersey.\\r\\nThe northern and southern sections of the Carolina colony operated more or less independently until 1691, when Philip Ludwell was appointed governor of the entire province. From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina, as the descendants of the colony's proprietors fought over the direction of the colony.[30] The colonists of Charles Town finally deposed their governor and elected their own government. This marked the start of separate governments in the Province of North Carolina and the Province of South Carolina. In 1729, the king formally revoked Carolina's colonial charter and established both North Carolina and South Carolina as crown colonies.[31]\\r\\nIn the 1730s, Parliamentarian James Oglethorpe proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized with the \\"worthy poor\\" of England to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of Georgia on June 9, 1732.[32] Oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery and recruited only the most worthy settlers, but by 1750 the colony remained sparsely populated. The proprietors gave up their charter in 1752, at which point Georgia became a crown colony.[33]\\r\\nThe colonial population of Thirteen Colonies grew immensely in the 18th century. According to historian Alan Taylor, the population of the Thirteen Colonies stood at 1.5 million in 1750, which represented four-fifths of the population of British North America.[34] More than 90 percent of the colonists lived as farmers, though some seaports also flourished. In 1760, the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and Boston had a population in excess of 16,000, which was small by European standards.[35] By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the gross domestic product of the British Empire.[36]\\r\\nAs the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland all laid claim to the land in the Ohio River valley. The colonies engaged in a scramble to purchase land from Indian tribes, as the British insisted that claims to land should rest on legitimate purchases.[37] Virginia was particularly intent on western expansion, and most of the elite Virginia families invested in the Ohio Company to promote the settlement of Ohio Country.[38]\\r\\nThe British colonies in North America became part of the global British trading network, as the value tripled for exports from British North America to Britain between 1700 and 1754. The colonists were restricted in trading with other European powers, but they found profitable trade partners in the other British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items.[39] American Indians far from the Atlantic coast supplied the Atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins.[40] British North America had an advantage in natural resources and established its own thriving shipbuilding industry, and many North American merchants engaged in the transatlantic trade.[41]\\r\\nImproved economic conditions and easing of religious persecution in Europe made it more difficult to recruit labor to the colonies, and many colonies became increasingly reliant on slave labor, particularly in the South. The population of slaves in British North America grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750, and the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves.[42] Slaves supported vast plantation economies in the South, while slaves in the North worked in a variety of occupations.[43] There were some slave revolts, such as the Stono Rebellion and the New York Conspiracy of 1741, but these uprisings were suppressed.[44]\\r\\nA small proportion of the English population migrated to British North America after 1700, but the colonies attracted new immigrants from other European countries. These immigrants traveled to all of the colonies, but the Middle Colonies attracted the most and continued to be more ethically diverse than the other colonies.[45] Numerous settlers immigrated from Ireland,[46] both Catholic and Protestantparticularly \\"New Light\\" Ulster Presbyterians.[47] Protestant Germans also migrated in large numbers, particularly to Pennsylvania.[48] In the 1740s, the Thirteen Colonies underwent the First Great Awakening.[49]\\r\\nIn 1738, an incident involving a Welsh mariner named Robert Jenkins sparked the War of Jenkins' Ear between Britain and Spain. Hundreds of North Americans volunteered for Admiral Edward Vernon's assault on Cartegena de Indias, a Spanish city in South America.[50] The war against Spain merged into a broader conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession, but most colonists called it King George's War.[51] In 1745, British and colonial forces captured the town of Louisbourg, and the war came to an end with the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. However, many colonists were angered when Britain returned Louisbourg to France in return for Madras and other territories.[52] In the aftermath of the war, both the British and French sought to expand into the Ohio River valley.[53]\\r\\nThe French and Indian War (1754ÿ63) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the Seven Years' War. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley.[54]\\r\\nThe French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when William Pitt the Elder decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America in order to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a \\"world war\\". During the war, it became increasingly apparent to American colonists that they were under the authority of the British Empire, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in their lives.\\r\\nThe war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still American. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained Americans for battle, most notably George Washington, which benefited the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.[54] The relations were not always positive between the British military establishment and the colonists, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops. At the 1754 Albany Congress, Pennsylvania colonist Benjamin Franklin proposed the Albany Plan which would have created a unified government of the Thirteen Colonies for coordination of defense and other matters, but the plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies.[55]\\r\\nIn the Treaty of Paris (1763), France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of Louisiana west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day Nova Scotia, and most of the Hudson Bay watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained Spanish Florida, from which it formed the colonies of East and West Florida. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.\\r\\nThe British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. British Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.[54]\\r\\nThe British were left with large debts following the French and Indian War, so British leaders decided to increase taxation and control of the Thirteen Colonies.[56] They imposed several new taxes, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. Later acts included the Currency Act of 1764, the Stamp Act of 1765, and the Townshend Acts of 1767.[57]\\r\\nThe British also sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French by keeping them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 restricted settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, as this was designated an Indian Reserve.[58] Some groups of settlers disregarded the proclamation, however, and continued to move west and establish farms.[59] The proclamation was soon modified and was no longer a hindrance to settlement, but the fact angered the colonists that it had been promulgated without their prior consultation.[60]\\r\\nParliament had directly levied duties and excise taxes on the colonies, bypassing the colonial legislatures, and Americans began to insist on the principle of \\"no taxation without representation\\" with intense protests over the Stamp Act of 1765.[61] They argued that the colonies had no representation in the British Parliament, so it was a violation of their rights as Englishmen for taxes to be imposed upon them. Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes.\\r\\nColonial discontentment grew with the passage of the 1773 Tea Act, which reduced taxes on tea sold by the East India Company in an effort to undercut competition, and Prime Minister North's ministry hoped that this would establish a precedent of colonists accepting British taxation policies. Trouble escalated over the tea tax, as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea, and those in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the Boston Tea Party in 1773 when the Sons of Liberty dumped thousands of pounds of tea into the water. Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the Intolerable Acts, which greatly restricted self-government in the colony of Massachusetts. These laws also allowed British military commanders to claim colonial homes for the quartering of soldiers, regardless whether the American civilians were willing or not to have soldiers in their homes. The laws further revoked colonial rights to hold trials in cases involving soldiers or crown officials, forcing such trials to be held in England rather than in America. Parliament also sent Thomas Gage to serve as Governor of Massachusetts and as the commander of British forces in North America.[62]\\r\\nBy 1774, colonists still hoped to remain part of the British Empire, but discontentment was widespread concerning British rule throughout the Thirteen Colonies.[63] Colonists elected delegates to the First Continental Congress which convened in Philadelphia in September 1774. In the aftermath of the Intolerable Acts, the delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king; they would accept royal governors as agents of the king, but they were no longer willing to recognize Parliament's right to pass legislation affecting the colonies. Most delegates opposed an attack on the British position in Boston, and the Continental Congress instead agreed to the imposition of a boycott known as the Continental Association. The boycott proved effective and the value of British imports dropped dramatically.[64] The Thirteen Colonies became increasingly divided between Patriots opposed to British rule and Loyalists who supported it.[65]\\r\\nIn response, the colonies formed bodies of elected representatives known as Provincial Congresses, and Colonists began to boycott imported British merchandise.[66] Later in 1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. During the Second Continental Congress, the remaining colony of Georgia sent delegates, as well.\\r\\nMassachusetts Governor Thomas Gage feared a confrontation with the colonists; he requested reinforcements from Britain, but the British government was not willing to pay for the expense of stationing tens of thousands of soldiers in the Thirteen Colonies. Gage was instead ordered to seize Patriot arsenals. He dispatched a force to march on the arsenal at Concord, Massachusetts, but the Patriots learned about it and blocked their advance. The Patriots repulsed the British force at the April 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord, then lay siege to Boston.[67]\\r\\nBy spring 1775, all royal officials had been expelled, and the Continental Congress hosted a convention of delegates for the 13 colonies. It raised an army to fight the British and named George Washington its commander, made treaties, declared independence, and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states.[68] The Second Continental Congress assembled in May 1775 and began to coordinate armed resistance against Britain. It established a government that recruited soldiers and printed its own money. General Washington took command of the Patriot soldiers in New England and forced the British to withdraw from Boston. In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Britain. With the help of France and Spain, they defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War. In the Treaty of Paris (1783), Britain officially recognized the independence of the United States of America.\\r\\nThe colonial population rose to a quarter of a million during the 17th century, and to nearly 2.5 million on the eve of the American revolution. Perkins (1988) notes the importance of good health for the growth of the colonies: \\"Fewer deaths among the young meant that a higher proportion of the population reached reproductive age, and that fact alone helps to explain why the colonies grew so rapidly.\\"[70] There were many other reasons for the population growth besides good health, such as the Great Migration.\\r\\nBy 1776, about 85% of the white population's ancestry originated in the British Isles (English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh), 9% of German origin, 4% Dutch and 2% Huguenot French and other minorities. Over 90% were farmers, with several small cities that were also seaports linking the colonial economy to the larger British Empire. These populations continued to grow at a rapid rate during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, primarily because of high birth rates and relatively low death rates. Immigration was a minor factor from 1774 to 1830.[71]\\r\\nSlavery was legal and practiced in many of the Thirteen Colonies. In most places, it involved house servants or farm workers. It was of economic importance in the export-oriented tobacco plantations of Virginia and Maryland and on the rice and indigo plantations of South Carolina.[72] About 287,000 slaves were imported into the Thirteen Colonies over a period of 160 years, or 2% of the estimated 12 million taken from Africa to the Americas via the Atlantic slave trade. The great majority went to sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil, where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished. By the mid-18th century, life expectancy was much higher in the American colonies.[73]\\r\\nThe numbers grew rapidly through a very high birth rate and low mortality rate, reaching nearly four million by the 1860 census. From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that in England.\\r\\nProtestantism was the predominant religious affiliation in the Thirteen Colonies, although there were also Catholics, Jews, and deists, and a large fraction had no religious connection. The Church of England was officially established in most of the South. The Puritan movement became the Congregational church, and it was the established religious affiliation in Massachusetts and Connecticut into the 18th century.[75] In practice, this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses. The Anglican parishes in the South were under the control of local vestries and had public functions, such as repair of the roads and relief of the poor.[76]\\r\\nThe colonies were religiously diverse, with different Protestant denominations brought by British, German, Dutch, and other immigrants. The Reformed tradition was the foundation for Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Continental Reformed denominations. French Huguenots set up their own Reformed congregations. The Dutch Reformed Church was strong among Dutch Americans in New York and New Jersey, while Lutheranism was prevalent among German immigrants. Germans also brought diverse forms of Anabaptism, especially the Mennonite variety. Reformed Baptist preacher Roger Williams founded Providence Plantations which became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Jews were clustered in a few port cities. The Baltimore family founded Maryland and brought in fellow Catholics from England.[77] Presbyterians were chiefly immigrants from Scotland and Ulster who favored the back country and frontier districts.[78]\\r\\nQuakers were well established in Pennsylvania, where they controlled the governorship and the legislature for many years.[79] Quakers were also numerous in Rhode Island. Baptists and Methodists were growing rapidly during the First Great Awakening of the 1740s.[80] Many denominations sponsored missions to the local Indians.[81]\\r\\nHigher education was available for young men in the North, and most students were aspiring Protestant ministers. The oldest colleges were Harvard College, College of New Jersey (Princeton), Yale College, and College of Rhode Island (Brown). Others were King's College (Columbia), the College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania), and Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. South of Philadelphia, there was only the College of William and Mary which trained the secular elite in Virginia, especially aspiring lawyers.\\r\\nMost New England towns sponsored public schools for boys, but public schooling was rare elsewhere. Girls were educated at home or by small local private schools, and they had no access to college. Aspiring physicians and lawyers typically learned as apprentices to an established practitioner, although some young men went to medical schools in Scotland.[82]\\r\\nThe three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial (royal colony), proprietary, and charter. These governments were all subordinate to the King of England with no representation in the Parliament of Great Britain. The administration of all British colonies was overseen by the Board of Trade in London beginning late in the 17th century.\\r\\nThe provincial colony was governed by commissions created at pleasure of the king. A governor and his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could prorogue (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of England. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation. New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were crown colonies. Massachusetts became a crown colony at the end of the 17th century.\\r\\nProprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies, except that lord proprietors appointed the governor rather than the king. They were set up after the English Restoration of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty. Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies.[83]\\r\\nCharter governments were political corporations created by letters patent, giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials. Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.[84] Providence Plantations merged with the settlements at Rhode Island and Warwick to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, which also became a charter colony in 1636.\\r\\nAfter 1680, the royal government in London took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies, which were growing rapidly in population and wealth. In 1680, only Virginia was a royal colony; by 1720, half were under the control of royal governors. These governors were appointees closely tied to the government in London.\\r\\nHistorians before the 1880s emphasized American nationalism. However, scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the \\"Imperial school\\" led by Herbert L. Osgood, George Louis Beer, Charles McLean Andrews, and Lawrence H. Gipson. This viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s, and they emphasized and often praised the attention that London gave to all the colonies. In this view, there was never a threat (before the 1770s) that any colony would revolt or seek independence.[85]\\r\\nBritish settlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate without a land-owning aristocracy, along with a pattern of free elections which put a strong emphasis on voter participation. The colonies offered a much freer degree of suffrage than England or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature, and they could even vote for the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island.[86] Voters were required to hold an \\"interest\\" in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, \\"it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly\\".[87] The main legal criterion for having an \\"interest\\" was ownership of real estate property, which was uncommon in Britain, where 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. (Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head.) London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholdersthat is, those who did not own land. Nevertheless, land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.[88]\\r\\nThe colonial political culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen. But sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad-hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Outside of Puritan New England, election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speechesall the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. Candidate George Washington spent S39 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to \\"swill the planters with bumbo\\" (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.[89]\\r\\nThe actual rate of voting ranged from 20% to 40% of all adult white males. The rates were higher in Pennsylvania and New York, where long-standing factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate. New York and Rhode Island developed long-lasting two-faction systems that held together for years at the colony level, but they did not reach into local affairs. The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections, and they had little basis in policy or ideology. Elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl, based on personality rather than long-lived factions or serious disputes on issues.[86]\\r\\nThe colonies were independent of one other long before 1774; indeed, all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations. Further, efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the Albany Congress of 1754 led by Benjamin Franklin. The thirteen all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the Rights of Englishmen which they were determined to protect from imperial interference.[90]\\r\\nThe British Empire at the time operated under the mercantile system, where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britainits merchants and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies.[91]\\r\\nMercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchantsand kept others outby trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smugglingwhich became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.[92] The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured New Amsterdam (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.[93]\\r\\nBritain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish, or Dutch empires using the Navigation Acts, which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants (Writs of Assistance). In 1761, Boston lawyer James Otis argued that the writs violated the constitutional rights of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, \\"Then and there the child Independence was born.\\"[94]\\r\\nHowever, the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade; they only opposed legislation which affected them internally.\\r\\nBesides these thirteen colonies, Britain had another dozen in the New World. Those in the British West Indies, Newfoundland, the Province of Quebec, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Bermuda, and East and West Florida remained loyal to the crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war was over, and later sold it to the United States). There was a certain degree of sympathy with the Patriot cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation.[95] The British crown had only recently acquired those lands, and many of the issues facing the Thirteen Colonies did not apply to them, especially in the case of Quebec and Florida.[96]\\r\\nAt the time of the war Britain had seven other colonies on the Atlantic coast of North America: Newfoundland, Rupert's Land (the area around the Hudson Bay), Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, East Florida, West Florida, and the Province of Quebec. There were other colonies in the Americas as well, largely in the British West Indies. These colonies remained loyal to the crown.[97]\\r\\nNewfoundland stayed loyal to Britain without question. It was exempt from the Navigation Acts and shared none of the grievances of the continental colonies. It was tightly bound to Britain and controlled by the Royal Navy and had no assembly that could voice grievances.\\r\\nNova Scotia had a large Yankee element that had recently arrived from New England, and shared the sentiments of the Americans about demanding the rights of the British men. The royal government in Halifax reluctantly allowed the Yankees of Nova Scotia a kind of \\"neutrality.\\" In any case, the island-like geography and the presence of the major British naval base at Halifax made the thought of armed resistance impossible.[98]\\r\\nQuebec was inhabited by French Catholic settlers who came under British control in the previous decade. The Quebec Act of 1774 gave them formal cultural autonomy within the empire, and many priests feared the intense Protestantism in New England. The American grievances over taxation had little relevance, and there was no assembly nor elections of any kind that could have mobilized any grievances. Even so, the Americans offered membership in the new nation and sent a military expedition that failed to capture Canada in 1775. Most Canadians remained neutral but some joined the American cause.[99]\\r\\nIn the West Indies the elected assemblies of Jamaica, Grenada, and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause and called for mediation, but the others were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them recognize the need for British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.[100]\\r\\nIn Bermuda and the Bahamas local leaders were angry at the food shortages caused by British blockade of American ports. There was increasing sympathy for the American cause, including smuggling, and both colonies were considered \\"passive allies\\" of the United States throughout the war. When an American naval squadron arrived in the Bahamas to seize gunpowder, the colony gave no resistance at all.[101]\\r\\nEast Florida and West Florida were territories transferred from Spain to Britain after the French and Indian War by treaty. The few British colonists there needed protection from attacks by Indians and Spanish privateers. After 1775, East Florida became a major base for the British war effort in the South, especially in the invasions of Georgia and South Carolina.[102] However, Spain seized Pensacola in West Florida in 1781, then recovered both territories in the Treaty of Paris that ended the war in 1783. Spain ultimately transferred the Florida provinces to the United States in 1819.[103]\\r\\nThe first British Empire centered on the Thirteen Colonies, which attracted large numbers of settlers from Britain. The \\"Imperial School\\" in the 1900ÿ1930s took a favorable view of the benefits of empire, emphasizing its successful economic integration.[104] The Imperial School included such historians as Herbert L. Osgood, George Louis Beer, Charles M. Andrews, and Lawrence Gipson.[105]\\r\\nThe shock of Britain's defeat in 1783 caused a radical revision of British policies on colonialism, thereby producing what historians call the end of the First British Empire, even though Britain still controlled Canada and some islands in the West Indies.[106] Ashley Jackson writes:\\r\\nThe first British Empire was largely destroyed by the loss of the American colonies, followed by a \\"swing to the east\\" and the foundation of a second British Empire based on commercial and territorial expansion in South Asia.[107]\\r\\nMuch of the historiography concerns the reasons why the Americans rebelled in the 1770s and successfully broke away. Since the 1960s, the mainstream of historiography has emphasized the growth of American consciousness and nationalism and the colonial republican value-system, in opposition to the aristocratic viewpoint of British leaders.[108]\\r\\nHistorians in recent decades have mostly used one of three approaches to analyze the American Revolution:[109]\\r\\n Media related to Thirteen Colonies at Wikimedia Commons","input":"Where were the original 13 english colonies established?"},{"output":"around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose","context":"Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products.[1] The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy in the process, as weak so-called \\"high-energy\\" bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction which releases heat. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, most of which are redox reactions themselves. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell because of the slow release of energy from the series of reactions.\\r\\nNutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent (electron acceptor) is molecular oxygen (O2). The chemical energy stored in ATP (its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form, thereby transferring energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP. Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are consumed as reactants, it is the preferred method of pyruvate breakdown in glycolysis and requires that pyruvate enter the mitochondria in order to be fully oxidized by the Krebs cycle. The products of this process are carbon dioxide and water, but the energy transferred is used to break bonds in ADP as the third phosphate group is added to form ATP (adenosine triphosphate), by substrate-level phosphorylation, NADH and FADH2\\r\\nThe negative G indicates that the reaction can occur spontaneously.\\r\\nThe potential of NADH and FADH2 is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the \\"terminal electron acceptor\\". Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation. This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group. Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the Krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport system).[2] However, this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix, and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose.[2]\\r\\nAerobic metabolism is up to 15 times more efficient than anaerobic metabolism (which yields 2?molecules ATP per 1?molecule glucose). However some anaerobic organisms, such as methanogens are able to continue with anaerobic respiration, yielding more ATP by using other inorganic molecules (not oxygen) as final electron acceptors in the electron transport chain. They share the initial pathway of glycolysis but aerobic metabolism continues with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The post-glycolytic reactions take place in the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells, and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells.\\r\\n1. Glycolysis:\\r\\n--- 2 ATPs + Glucose L 2 Pyruvic Acid + 4 Hydrogen + 4 ATPs\\r\\n2. Formation of Acetyl CoA:\\r\\n--- 2 Pyruvic Acid + 2 CoA L 2 Acetyl CoA + 2 Carbon Dioxide + 2 Hydrogen\\r\\n3.

This pathway can function with or without the presence of oxygen. In humans, aerobic conditions produce pyruvate and anaerobic conditions produce lactate. In aerobic conditions, the process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (pyruvic acid), generating energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP. Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced, however, two are consumed as part of the preparatory phase. The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity (decrease its stability) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvate molecules by the enzyme aldolase. During the pay-off phase of glycolysis, four phosphate groups are transferred to ADP by substrate-level phosphorylation to make four ATP, and two NADH are produced when the pyruvate are oxidized. The overall reaction can be expressed this way:\\r\\nStarting with glucose, 1 ATP is used to donate a phosphate to glucose to produce glucose 6-phosphate. Glycogen can be converted into glucose 6-phosphate as well with the help of glycogen phosphorylase. During energy metabolism, glucose 6-phosphate becomes fructose 6-phosphate. An additional ATP is used to phosphorylate fructose 6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-disphosphate by the help of phosphofructokinase. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate then splits into two phosphorylated molecules with three carbon chains which later degrades into pyruvate.\\r\\nGlycolysis can be literally translated as \\"sugar splitting\\".[3]\\r\\nPyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). The PDC contains multiple copies of three enzymes and is located in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and in the cytosol of prokaryotes. In the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, one molecule of NADH and one molecule of CO2 is formed.\\r\\nThis is also called the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle. When oxygen is present, acetyl-CoA is produced from the pyruvate molecules created from glycolysis. Once acetyl-CoA is formed, aerobic or anaerobic respiration can occur.[4] When oxygen is present, the mitochondria will undergo aerobic respiration which leads to the Krebs cycle. However, if oxygen is not present, fermentation of the pyruvate molecule will occur. In the presence of oxygen, when acetyl-CoA is produced, the molecule then enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) inside the mitochondrial matrix, and is oxidized to CO2 while at the same time reducing NAD to NADH. NADH can be used by the electron transport chain to create further ATP as part of oxidative phosphorylation. To fully oxidize the equivalent of one glucose molecule, two acetyl-CoA must be metabolized by the Krebs cycle. Two waste products, H2O and CO2, are created during this cycle.\\r\\nThe citric acid cycle is an 8-step process involving 18 different enzymes and co-enzymes.[4] During the cycle, acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) + oxaloacetate (4 carbons) yields citrate (6 carbons), which is rearranged to a more reactive form called isocitrate (6 carbons). Isocitrate is modified to become ϫ-ketoglutarate (5 carbons), succinyl-CoA, succinate, fumarate, malate, and, finally, oxaloacetate.\\r\\nThe net gain of high-energy compounds from one cycle is 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 1 GTP; the GTP may subsequently be used to produce ATP. Thus, the total yield from 1 glucose molecule (2 pyruvate molecules) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP.\\r\\nIn eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. It comprises the electron transport chain that establishes a proton gradient (chemiosmotic potential) across the boundary of inner membrane by oxidizing the NADH produced from the Krebs cycle. ATP is synthesized by the ATP synthase enzyme when the chemiosmotic gradient is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. The electrons are finally transferred to exogenous oxygen and, with the addition of two protons, water is formed.\\r\\nThe table below describes the reactions involved when one glucose molecule is fully oxidized into carbon dioxide. It is assumed that all the reduced coenzymes are oxidized by the electron transport chain and used for oxidative phosphorylation.\\r\\nAlthough there is a theoretical yield of 38 ATP molecules per glucose during cellular respiration, such conditions are generally not realized because of losses such as the cost of moving pyruvate (from glycolysis), phosphate, and ADP (substrates for ATP synthesis) into the mitochondria. All are actively transported using carriers that utilize the stored energy in the proton electrochemical gradient.\\r\\nThe outcome of these transport processes using the proton electrochemical gradient is that more than 3 H+ are needed to make 1 ATP. Obviously this reduces the theoretical efficiency of the whole process and the likely maximum is closer to 28ÿ30 ATP molecules.[2] In practice the efficiency may be even lower because the inner membrane of the mitochondria is slightly leaky to protons.[5] Other factors may also dissipate the proton gradient creating an apparently leaky mitochondria. An uncoupling protein known as thermogenin is expressed in some cell types and is a channel that can transport protons. When this protein is active in the inner membrane it short circuits the coupling between the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis. The potential energy from the proton gradient is not used to make ATP but generates heat. This is particularly important in brown fat thermogenesis of newborn and hibernating mammals.\\r\\nAccording to some of newer sources the ATP yield during aerobic respiration is not 36ÿ38, but only about 30ÿ32 ATP molecules / 1 molecule of glucose [6], because:\\r\\nSo finally we have, per molecule of glucose\\r\\nAltogether this gives 4 + 3 (or 5) + 20 + 3 = 30 (or 32) ATP per molecule of glucose\\r\\nThe total ATP yield in ethanol or lactic acid fermentation is only 2 molecules coming from glycolysis, because pyruvate is not transferred to the mitochondrion and finally oxidized to the carbon dioxide (CO2), but reduced to ethanol or lactic acid in the cytoplasm.[6]\\r\\nWithout oxygen, pyruvate (pyruvic acid) is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion, but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD+ so it can be re-used in glycolysis. In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD+ for glycolysis. This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is lactic acid. This type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process is made by substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen.\\r\\nFermentation is less efficient at using the energy from glucose: only 2 ATP are produced per glucose, compared to the 38 ATP per glucose nominally produced by aerobic respiration. This is because the waste products of fermentation still contain chemical potential energy that can be released by oxidation. Ethanol, for example, can be burned in an internal combustion engine like gasoline. Glycolytic ATP, however, is created more quickly. For prokaryotes to continue a rapid growth rate when they are shifted from an aerobic environment to an anaerobic environment, they must increase the rate of the glycolytic reactions. For multicellular organisms, during short bursts of strenuous activity, muscle cells use fermentation to supplement the ATP production from the slower aerobic respiration, so fermentation may be used by a cell even before the oxygen levels are depleted, as is the case in sports that do not require athletes to pace themselves, such as sprinting.\\r\\nCellular respiration is the process by which biological fuels are oxidised in the presence of an inorganic electron acceptor (such as oxygen) to produce large amounts of energy, to drive the bulk production of ATP.\\r\\nAnaerobic respiration is used by some microorganisms in which neither oxygen (aerobic respiration) nor pyruvate derivatives (fermentation) is the final electron acceptor. Rather, an inorganic acceptor such as sulfate or nitrate is used. Such organisms are typically found in unusual places such as underwater caves or near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean.","input":"How many atp molecules are produced during the electron transport chain?"},{"output":"emission of electrons or other free carriers","context":"The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons or other free carriers when light shines on a material. Electrons emitted in this manner can be called photo electrons. This phenomenon is commonly studied in electronic physics, as well as in fields of chemistry, such as quantum chemistry or electrochemistry.\\r\\nAccording to classical electromagnetic theory, this effect can be attributed to the transfer of energy from the light to an electron. From this perspective, an alteration in the intensity of light would induce changes in the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the metal. Furthermore, according to this theory, a sufficiently dim light would be expected to show a time lag between the initial shining of its light and the subsequent emission of an electron. However, the experimental results did not correlate with either of the two predictions made by classical theory.\\r\\nInstead, electrons are dislodged only by the impingement of photons when those photons reach or exceed a threshold frequency (energy). Below that threshold, no electrons are emitted from the material regardless of the light intensity or the length of time of exposure to the light (rarely, an electron will escape by absorbing two or more quanta. However, this is extremely rare because by the time it absorbs enough quanta to escape, the electron will probably have emitted the rest of the quanta.). To make sense of the fact that light can eject electrons even if its intensity is low, Albert Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of discrete wave packets (photons), each with energy h. This shed light on Max Planck's previous discovery of the Planck relation (E = h) linking energy (E) and frequency () as arising from quantization of energy. The factor h is known as the Planck constant.[1][2]\\r\\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz[2][3] discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1900, while studying black-body radiation, the German physicist Max Planck suggested that the energy carried by electromagnetic waves could only be released in \\"packets\\" of energy. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper advancing the hypothesis that light energy is carried in discrete quantized packets to explain experimental data from the photoelectric effect. This model contributed to the development of quantum mechanics. In 1914, Robert Millikan's experiment supported Einstein's model of the photoelectric effect. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921 for \\"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\\",[4] and Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923 for \\"his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect\\".[5]\\r\\nThe photoelectric effect requires photons with energies approaching zero (in the case of negative electron affinity) to over 1 MeV for core electrons in elements with a high atomic number. Emission of conduction electrons from typical metals usually requires a few electron-volts, corresponding to short-wavelength visible or ultraviolet light. Study of the photoelectric effect led to important steps in understanding the quantum nature of light and electrons and influenced the formation of the concept of waveÿparticle duality.[1] Other phenomena where light affects the movement of electric charges include the photoconductive effect (also known as photoconductivity or photoresistivity), the photovoltaic effect, and the photoelectrochemical effect.\\r\\nPhotoemission can occur from any material, but it is most easily observable from metals or other conductors because the process produces a charge imbalance, and if this charge imbalance is not neutralized by current flow (enabled by conductivity), the potential barrier to emission increases until the emission current ceases. It is also usual to have the emitting surface in a vacuum, since gases impede the flow of photoelectrons and make them difficult to observe. Additionally, the energy barrier to photoemission is usually increased by thin oxide layers on metal surfaces if the metal has been exposed to oxygen, so most practical experiments and devices based on the photoelectric effect use clean metal surfaces in a vacuum.\\r\\nWhen the photoelectron is emitted into a solid rather than into a vacuum, the term internal photoemission is often used, and emission into a vacuum distinguished as external photoemission.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photons of a light beam have a characteristic energy proportional to the frequency of the light. In the photoemission process, if an electron within some material absorbs the energy of one photon and acquires more energy than the work function (the electron binding energy) of the material, it is ejected. If the photon energy is too low, the electron is unable to escape the material. Since an increase in the intensity of low-frequency light will only increase the number of low-energy photons sent over a given interval of time, this change in intensity will not create any single photon with enough energy to dislodge an electron. Thus, the energy of the emitted electrons does not depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but only on the energy (equivalently frequency) of the individual photons. It is an interaction between the incident photon and the outermost electrons.\\r\\nElectrons can absorb energy from photons when irradiated, but they usually follow an \\"all or nothing\\" principle. All of the energy from one photon must be absorbed and used to liberate one electron from atomic binding, or else the energy is re-emitted. If the photon energy is absorbed, some of the energy liberates the electron from the atom, and the rest contributes to the electron's kinetic energy as a free particle.[6][7][8]\\r\\nThe theory of the photoelectric effect must explain the experimental observations of the emission of electrons from an illuminated metal surface.\\r\\nFor a given metal, there exists a certain minimum frequency of incident radiation below which no photoelectrons are emitted. This frequency is called the threshold frequency. Increasing the frequency of the incident beam, keeping the number of incident photons fixed (this would result in a proportionate increase in energy) increases the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted. Thus the stopping voltage increases. The number of electrons also changes because the probability that each photon results in an emitted electron is a function of photon energy. If the intensity of the incident radiation of a given frequency is increased, there is no effect on the kinetic energy of each photoelectron.\\r\\nAbove the threshold frequency, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectron depends on the frequency of the incident light, but is independent of the intensity of the incident light so long as the latter is not too high.[9]\\r\\nFor a given metal and frequency of incident radiation, the rate at which photoelectrons are ejected is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light. An increase in the intensity of the incident beam (keeping the frequency fixed) increases the magnitude of the photoelectric current, although the stopping voltage remains the same.\\r\\nThe time lag between the incidence of radiation and the emission of a photoelectron is very small, less than 10?9 second.\\r\\nThe direction of distribution of emitted electrons peaks in the direction of polarization (the direction of the electric field) of the incident light, if it is linearly polarized.[10]\\r\\nIn 1905, Einstein proposed an explanation of the photoelectric effect using a concept first put forward by Max Planck that light waves consist of tiny bundles or packets of energy known as photons or quanta.\\r\\nThe maximum kinetic energy \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\na\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle K_{\\\\mathrm {max} }}\\r\\n\\r\\n of an ejected electron is given by\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nh\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle h}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the Planck constant and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle f}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the frequency of the incident photon.

For discussion, a light source illuminates a plate P, and another plate electrode Q collects any emitted electrons. We vary the potential between P and Q and measure the current flowing in the external circuit between the two plates.\\r\\nIf the frequency and the intensity of the incident radiation are fixed, the photoelectric current increases gradually with an increase in the positive potential on the collector electrode until all the photoelectrons emitted are collected. The photoelectric current attains a saturation value and does not increase further for any increase in the positive potential. The saturation current increases with the increase of the light intensity. It also increases with greater frequencies due to a greater probability of electron emission when collisions happen with higher energy photons.\\r\\nIf we apply a negative potential to the collector plate Q with respect to the plate P and gradually increase it, the photoelectric current decreases, becoming zero at a certain negative potential. The negative potential on the collector at which the photoelectric current becomes zero is called the stopping potential or cut off potential[13]\\r\\ni.

For any particular material, there is a threshold frequency that must be exceeded, independent of light intensity, to observe any electron emission.\\r\\nIn the X-ray regime, the photoelectric effect in crystalline material is often decomposed into three steps:[14]:50ÿ51\\r\\nIn the three-step model, an electron can take multiple paths through these three steps. All paths can interfere in the sense of the path integral formulation. For surface states and molecules the three-step model does still make some sense as even most atoms have multiple electrons which can scatter the one electron leaving.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen a surface is exposed to electromagnetic radiation above a certain threshold frequency (typically visible light for alkali metals, near ultraviolet for other metals, and extreme ultraviolet for non-metals), the radiation is absorbed and electrons are emitted. Light, and especially ultra-violet light, discharges negatively electrified bodies with the production of rays of the same nature as cathode rays.[15] Under certain circumstances it can directly ionize gases.[15] The first of these phenomena was discovered by Hertz and Hallwachs in 1887.[15] The second was announced first by Philipp Lenard in 1900.[15]\\r\\nThe ultra-violet light to produce these effects may be obtained from an arc lamp, or by burning magnesium, or by sparking with an induction coil between zinc or cadmium terminals, the light from which is very rich in ultra-violet rays. Sunlight is not rich in ultra-violet rays, as these have been absorbed by the atmosphere, and it does not produce nearly so large an effect as the arc-light. Many substances besides metals discharge negative electricity under the action of ultraviolet light: lists of these substances will be found in papers by G. C. Schmidt[16] and O. Knoblauch.[17]\\r\\nIn 1839, Alexandre Edmond Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic effect while studying the effect of light on electrolytic cells.[18] Though not equivalent to the photoelectric effect, his work on photovoltaics was instrumental in showing a strong relationship between light and electronic properties of materials. In 1873, Willoughby Smith discovered photoconductivity in selenium while testing the metal for its high resistance properties in conjunction with his work involving submarine telegraph cables.[19]\\r\\nJohann Elster (1854ÿ1920) and Hans Geitel (1855ÿ1923), students in Heidelberg, developed the first practical photoelectric cells that could be used to measure the intensity of light.[20][21]:458 Elster and Geitel had investigated with great success the effects produced by light on electrified bodies.[22]\\r\\nIn 1887, Heinrich Hertz observed the photoelectric effect and the production and reception of electromagnetic waves.[15] He published these observations in the journal Annalen der Physik. His receiver consisted of a coil with a spark gap, where a spark would be seen upon detection of electromagnetic waves. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better. However, he noticed that the maximum spark length was reduced when in the box. A glass panel placed between the source of electromagnetic waves and the receiver absorbed ultraviolet radiation that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he replaced glass with quartz, as quartz does not absorb UV radiation. Hertz concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained. He did not further pursue investigation of this effect.\\r\\nThe discovery by Hertz[23] in 1887 that the incidence of ultra-violet light on a spark gap facilitated the passage of the spark, led immediately to a series of investigations by Hallwachs,[24] Hoor,[25] Righi[26] and Stoletow[27][28][29][30][31][32][33] on the effect of light, and especially of ultra-violet light, on charged bodies. It was proved by these investigations that a newly cleaned surface of zinc, if charged with negative electricity, rapidly loses this charge however small it may be when ultra-violet light falls upon the surface; while if the surface is uncharged to begin with, it acquires a positive charge when exposed to the light, the negative electrification going out into the gas by which the metal is surrounded; this positive electrification can be much increased by directing a strong airblast against the surface. If however the zinc surface is positively electrified it suffers no loss of charge when exposed to the light: this result has been questioned, but a very careful examination of the phenomenon by Elster and Geitel[34] has shown that the loss observed under certain circumstances is due to the discharge by the light reflected from the zinc surface of negative electrification on neighbouring conductors induced by the positive charge, the negative electricity under the influence of the electric field moving up to the positively electrified surface.[35]\\r\\nWith regard to the Hertz effect, the researches from the start showed a great complexity of the phenomenon of photoelectric fatigue  that is, the progressive diminution of the effect observed upon fresh metallic surfaces. According to an important research by Wilhelm Hallwachs, ozone played an important part in the phenomenon.[36] However, other elements enter such as oxidation, the humidity, the mode of polish of the surface, etc. It was at the time not even sure that the fatigue is absent in a vacuum.\\r\\nIn the period from February 1888 and until 1891, a detailed analysis of photoeffect was performed by Aleksandr Stoletov with results published in 6 works;[37][38][39][40][41][42] four of them in Comptes Rendus, one review in Physikalische Revue (translated from Russian), and the last work in Journal de Physique. First, in these works Stoletov invented a new experimental setup which was more suitable for a quantitative analysis of photoeffect. Using this setup, he discovered the direct proportionality between the intensity of light and the induced photo electric current (the first law of photoeffect or Stoletov's law). One of his other findings resulted from measurements of the dependence of the intensity of the electric photo current on the gas pressure, where he found the existence of an optimal gas pressure Pm corresponding to a maximum photocurrent; this property was used for a creation of solar cells.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1899, J. J. Thomson investigated ultraviolet light in Crookes tubes.[43] Thomson deduced that the ejected particles were the same as those previously found in the cathode ray, later called electrons, which he called \\"corpuscles\\". In the research, Thomson enclosed a metal plate (a cathode) in a vacuum tube, and exposed it to high frequency radiation.[44] It was thought that the oscillating electromagnetic fields caused the atoms' field to resonate and, after reaching a certain amplitude, caused a subatomic \\"corpuscle\\" to be emitted, and current to be detected. The amount of this current varied with the intensity and colour of the radiation. Larger radiation intensity or frequency would produce more current.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe discovery of the ionization of gases by ultra-violet light was made by Philipp Lenard in 1900. As the effect was produced across several centimeters of air and made very great positive and small negative ions, it was natural to interpret the phenomenon, as did J. J. Thomson, as a Hertz effect upon the solid or liquid particles present in the gas.[15]\\r\\nIn 1902, Lenard observed that the energy of individual emitted electrons increased with the frequency (which is related to the color) of the light.[6]\\r\\nThis appeared to be at odds with Maxwell's wave theory of light, which predicted that the electron energy would be proportional to the intensity of the radiation.\\r\\nLenard observed the variation in electron energy with light frequency using a powerful electric arc lamp which enabled him to investigate large changes in intensity, and that had sufficient power to enable him to investigate the variation of potential with light frequency. His experiment directly measured potentials, not electron kinetic energy: he found the electron energy by relating it to the maximum stopping potential (voltage) in a phototube. He found that the calculated maximum electron kinetic energy is determined by the frequency of the light. For example, an increase in frequency results in an increase in the maximum kinetic energy calculated for an electron upon liberation ÿ ultraviolet radiation would require a higher applied stopping potential to stop current in a phototube than blue light. However Lenard's results were qualitative rather than quantitative because of the difficulty in performing the experiments: the experiments needed to be done on freshly cut metal so that the pure metal was observed, but it oxidised in a matter of minutes even in the partial vacuums he used. The current emitted by the surface was determined by the light's intensity, or brightness: doubling the intensity of the light doubled the number of electrons emitted from the surface.\\r\\nThe researches of Langevin and those of Eugene Bloch[45] have shown that the greater part of the Lenard effect is certainly due to this 'Hertz effect'. The Lenard effect upon the gas[clarification needed] itself nevertheless does exist. Refound by J. J. Thomson[46] and then more decisively by Frederic Palmer, Jr.,[47][48] it was studied and showed very different characteristics than those at first attributed to it by Lenard.[15]\\r\\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein solved this apparent paradox by describing light as composed of discrete quanta, now called photons, rather than continuous waves. Based upon Max Planck's theory of black-body radiation, Einstein theorized that the energy in each quantum of light was equal to the frequency multiplied by a constant, later called Planck's constant. A photon above a threshold frequency has the required energy to eject a single electron, creating the observed effect. This discovery led to the quantum revolution in physics and earned Einstein the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.[49] By wave-particle duality the effect can be analyzed purely in terms of waves though not as conveniently.[50]\\r\\nAlbert Einstein's mathematical description of how the photoelectric effect was caused by absorption of quanta of light was in one of his 1905 papers, named \\"On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\\". This paper proposed the simple description of \\"light quanta\\", or photons, and showed how they explained such phenomena as the photoelectric effect. His simple explanation in terms of absorption of discrete quanta of light explained the features of the phenomenon and the characteristic frequency.\\r\\nThe idea of light quanta began with Max Planck's published law of black-body radiation (\\"On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum\\"[51]) by assuming that Hertzian oscillators could only exist at energies E proportional to the frequency f of the oscillator by E = hf, where h is Planck's constant. By assuming that light actually consisted of discrete energy packets, Einstein wrote an equation for the photoelectric effect that agreed with experimental results. It explained why the energy of photoelectrons was dependent only on the frequency of the incident light and not on its intensity: a low-intensity, high-frequency source could supply a few high energy photons, whereas a high-intensity, low-frequency source would supply no photons of sufficient individual energy to dislodge any electrons. This was an enormous theoretical leap, but the concept was strongly resisted at first because it contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from James Clerk Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic behavior, and more generally, the assumption of infinite divisibility of energy in physical systems. Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, resistance to the idea of photons continued, since it appeared to contradict Maxwell's equations, which were well understood and verified.\\r\\nEinstein's work predicted that the energy of individual ejected electrons increases linearly with the frequency of the light. Perhaps surprisingly, the precise relationship had not at that time been tested. By 1905 it was known that the energy of photoelectrons increases with increasing frequency of incident light and is independent of the intensity of the light. However, the manner of the increase was not experimentally determined until 1914 when Robert Andrews Millikan showed that Einstein's prediction was correct.[7]\\r\\nThe photoelectric effect helped to propel the then-emerging concept of waveÿparticle duality in the nature of light. Light simultaneously possesses the characteristics of both waves and particles, each being manifested according to the circumstances. The effect was impossible to understand in terms of the classical wave description of light,[52][53][54] as the energy of the emitted electrons did not depend on the intensity of the incident radiation. Classical theory predicted that the electrons would 'gather up' energy over a period of time, and then be emitted.[53][55]\\r\\nThese are extremely light-sensitive vacuum tubes with a photocathode coated onto part (an end or side) of the inside of the envelope. The photocathode contains combinations of materials such as caesium, rubidium and antimony specially selected to provide a low work function, so when illuminated even by very low levels of light, the photocathode readily releases electrons. By means of a series of electrodes (dynodes) at ever-higher potentials, these electrons are accelerated and substantially increased in number through secondary emission to provide a readily detectable output current. Photomultipliers are still commonly used wherever low levels of light must be detected.[56]\\r\\nVideo camera tubes in the early days of television used the photoelectric effect, for example, Philo Farnsworth's \\"Image dissector\\" used a screen charged by the photoelectric effect to transform an optical image into a scanned electronic signal.[57]\\r\\nGold-leaf electroscopes are designed to detect static electricity. Charge placed on the metal cap spreads to the stem and the gold leaf of the electroscope. Because they then have the same charge, the stem and leaf repel each other. This will cause the leaf to bend away from the stem.\\r\\nThe electroscope is an important tool in illustrating the photoelectric effect. For example, if the electroscope is negatively charged throughout, there is an excess of electrons and the leaf is separated from the stem. If high-frequency light shines on the cap, the electroscope discharges and the leaf will fall limp. This is because the frequency of the light shining on the cap is above the cap's threshold frequency. The photons in the light have enough energy to liberate electrons from the cap, reducing its negative charge. This will discharge a negatively charged electroscope and further charge a positive electroscope. However, if the electromagnetic radiation hitting the metal cap does not have a high enough frequency (its frequency is below the threshold value for the cap), then the leaf will never discharge, no matter how long one shines the low-frequency light at the cap.[58]:389ÿ390\\r\\nSince the energy of the photoelectrons emitted is exactly the energy of the incident photon minus the material's work function or binding energy, the work function of a sample can be determined by bombarding it with a monochromatic X-ray source or UV source, and measuring the kinetic energy distribution of the electrons emitted.[14]:14ÿ20\\r\\nPhotoelectron spectroscopy is usually done in a high-vacuum environment, since the electrons would be scattered by gas molecules if they were present. However, some companies are now selling products that allow photoemission in air. The light source can be a laser, a discharge tube, or a synchrotron radiation source.[59]\\r\\nThe concentric hemispherical analyser (CHA) is a typical electron energy analyzer, and uses an electric field to change the directions of incident electrons, depending on their kinetic energies. For every element and core (atomic orbital) there will be a different binding energy. The many electrons created from each of these combinations will show up as spikes in the analyzer output, and these can be used to determine the elemental composition of the sample.\\r\\nThe photoelectric effect will cause spacecraft exposed to sunlight to develop a positive charge. This can be a major problem, as other parts of the spacecraft are in shadow which will result in the spacecraft developing a negative charge from nearby plasmas. The imbalance can discharge through delicate electrical components. The static charge created by the photoelectric effect is self-limiting, because a higher charged object doesn't give up its electrons as easily as a lower charged object does.[60][61]\\r\\nLight from the sun hitting lunar dust causes it to become charged through the photoelectric effect. The charged dust then repels itself and lifts off the surface of the Moon by electrostatic levitation.[62][63] This manifests itself almost like an \\"atmosphere of dust\\", visible as a thin haze and blurring of distant features, and visible as a dim glow after the sun has set. This was first photographed by the Surveyor program probes in the 1960s. It is thought that the smallest particles are repelled kilometers from the surface, and that the particles move in \\"fountains\\" as they charge and discharge.\\r\\nPhotons hitting a thin film of alkali metal or semiconductor material such as gallium arsenide in an image intensifier tube cause the ejection of photoelectrons due to the photoelectric effect. These are accelerated by an electrostatic field where they strike a phosphor coated screen, converting the electrons back into photons. Intensification of the signal is achieved either through acceleration of the electrons or by increasing the number of electrons through secondary emissions, such as with a micro-channel plate. Sometimes a combination of both methods is used. Additional kinetic energy is required to move an electron out of the conduction band and into the vacuum level. This is known as the electron affinity of the photocathode and is another barrier to photoemission other than the forbidden band, explained by the band gap model. Some materials such as Gallium Arsenide have an effective electron affinity that is below the level of the conduction band. In these materials, electrons that move to the conduction band are all of sufficient energy to be emitted from the material and as such, the film that absorbs photons can be quite thick. These materials are known as negative electron affinity materials.\\r\\nThe photoelectric effect is one interaction mechanism between photons and atoms. It is one of 12 theoretically possible interactions.[64]\\r\\nAt the high photon energies comparable to the electron rest energy of 6986818712184856999?511?keV, Compton scattering, another process, may take place. Above twice this (6987163742436971400?1.022?MeV) pair production may take place.[65] Compton scattering and pair production are examples of two other competing mechanisms.\\r\\nIndeed, even if the photoelectric effect is the favoured reaction for a particular single-photon bound-electron interaction, the result is also subject to statistical processes and is not guaranteed, albeit the photon has certainly disappeared and a bound electron has been excited (usually K or L shell electrons at gamma ray energies). The probability of the photoelectric effect occurring is measured by the cross section of interaction, . This has been found to be a function of the atomic number of the target atom and photon energy. A crude approximation, for photon energies above the highest atomic binding energy, is given by:[66]\\r\\nHere Z is atomic number and n is a number which varies between 4 and 5. (At lower photon energies a characteristic structure with edges appears, K edge, L edges, M edges, etc.) The obvious interpretation follows that the photoelectric effect rapidly decreases in significance, in the gamma ray region of the spectrum, with increasing photon energy, and that photoelectric effect increases steeply with atomic number. The corollary is that high-Z materials make good gamma-ray shields, which is the principal reason that lead (Z = 82) is a preferred and ubiquitous gamma radiation shield.[67]\\r\\nApplets","input":"How is light given off by an element?"},{"output":"Paradise Island","context":"Atlantis Paradise Island is an ocean-themed resort on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. It features a variety of accommodations built around Aquaventure, a 141-acre waterscape, which includes fresh and saltwater lagoons, pools, marine habitats, and water slides and river rides.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe property the Atlantis Paradise Island stands on was originally part of the Paradise Island Hotel and Casino, which opened in 1968. It was owned by Resorts International, a Merv Griffin company. Donald Trump at one point owned a majority stake in Resorts International. He spun-off ownership of the Trump Taj Mahal property from the company and sold Resorts in full, including outstanding debts from Taj Mahal construction, to Griffin.[1][2] Paradise Island was purchased by South African hotel magnate Sol Kerzner and Kerzner International Limited in 1994, and Kerzner's new resort, comprising the Coral and previously built Beach Towers, opened officially in 1998. The property's name was changed to Atlantis when the Royal Towers were built. The Coral and Beach Towers were later refurbished to match the theme of the Royal Towers. On 28 March 2007, a 600-suite luxury hotel named The Cove Atlantis opened on Paradise Island. Another tower, the 497-room The Reef Atlantis, opened 19 December 2007.[3]\\r\\nCurrently, the property is owned by Brookfield Asset Management and operated by Brookfield Hospitality. In October 2014, Atlantis, Paradise Island became a member of Marriott International's Autograph Collection Hotels, which includes a marketing partnership with the brand in order for guests to earn or redeem Marriott Rewards at Atlantis.[4]\\r\\nAccommodations at the resort include:\\r\\nThe Mayan Temple is the grand icon of Aquaventure, with a height of over six stories. The structure features a series of water rides, including the Leap of Faith, a 60-foot near-perpendicular plunge that sends riders through a clear acrylic tunnel submerged in a shark-filled lagoon. Also located atop the Mayan Temple are the Challenger Slides, two high-speed dueling slides where riders race against the clock for the best times. From just below, the Serpent Slide spins out from 48 feet up the Temple and into the Temple's dark core before emerging through the shark-filled lagoon at a more leisurely shark-viewing pace. For a milder change of pace, the Jungle Slide meanders through exotic jungles and caves built in the heart of the Mayan Temple.\\r\\nThe Rapid River is a mile long water ride complete with waves, artificial tidal surges, rapids, and environmental effects such as steam, special lighting, and waterfalls. The Falls and the Drop water coasters are accessible from The Rapid River without the guest needing to leave their inner-tube. The Rapid River has changed only slightly since its 2007 opening, with an optional rapids waterway closing.\\r\\nThe Power Tower is the tallest feature of Aquaventure, at 120 feet tall. The tower is home to four water slides: The Abyss, The Drop, The Falls, and The Surge. The Abyss drops riders a near-vertical 50 feet into total darkness and through a tumbling waterfall, ending their journey in a deep cenote filled with Alligator Gars. The Drop, The Falls and The Surge are three inner-tube slides powered by master-blaster technology, which uses jets of water to create roller coasters of waves that propel riders both up and downhill at a fast pace. The Drop spirals through the Power Towers dark center, while The Falls drops riders down 58 feet and propels them up again through various turns. The Surge also drops riders into a cavern from the top of the tower before ending in a flash flood.\\r\\nFor those under 54 inches (and their parents), multiple size appropriate rides can be found at Splashers, a childrens water play area and pool. Splashers is an elaborate Mayan-themed water play structure featuring two enclosed spiral body slides, one open spiral body slide, and a child-friendly version of the Mayan Temple Challenger slides nearby. Splashers also sports cargo nets and rope bridges for climbing in addition to water cannons, fountains, and water wheels for soaking. Overhead, a 320-gallon bucket regularly showers those below with 8,000 gallons of water per hour. Other swimming areas for younger guests include the Ripples Pool, with miniature slides, and Poseidons Kids Pool, with fountains and in-water play structures.\\r\\nAtlantis is home to 14 lagoons and more than 50,000 aquatic animals representing over 250 marine species. The Dig simulates the 11,000-year-old lost continent and provides a unique look at the wondrous civilization, home to some of the worlds most exotic sea creatures. The goal of The Dig is to provide guests with a taste of life in the legendary destroyed city of Atlantis. If one observes the bottom of the floors in the different aquariums, wreckage and debris scattered about represent the \\"Lost City of Atlantis.\\"\\r\\nA Predator Lagoon is full of sawfishes, barracudas, stingrays, and sharks. A 100-foot (30?m) clear acrylic tunnel runs underwater, allowing visitors unobstructed views of the marine environment.\\r\\nThe Ocean Club Golf is a private 18-hole, par 72 championship golf course that stretches for over 7,100 yards at the Atlantis, Paradise Island.[8] The course features a restaurant and bar located at the clubhouse.[9] Many professional golf events are hosted at the Ocean Club Golf including the LPGA Pure Silk Bahamas Classic.\\r\\nThe resort features a marina designed to dock large yachts. The eastern side of the marina features the Marina Village, which is a small shopping center reminiscent of market-style tourist centers, such as the Faneuil Hall in Boston or Downtown Disney at the American Disney parks.

The series takes place in a romanticized Stone Age setting, depicts the lives of the titular characters and their next-door neighbors and best friends. It was originally broadcast from September 30, 1960, to April 1, 1966 in a prime time schedule, the first such instance for an animated series.\\r\\nThe continuing popularity of The Flintstones rested heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.[5][6] The Flintstones was the most financially successful network animated franchise for three decades, until The Simpsons debuted decades later.[7] In 2013, TV Guide ranked The Flintstones the second Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time (after The Simpsons).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show is set in the Stone Age town of Bedrock (pop. 2500). In this fantasy version of the past, dinosaurs and other long-extinct animals co-exist with cavemen, saber-toothed cats, and woolly mammoths. Like their mid-20th century counterparts, these cavemen listen to records, live in split-level homes, and eat at restaurants, yet their technology is made entirely from preindustrial materials and powered primarily through the use of animals. For example, the cars are made out of stone, wood, and animal skins, and powered by the passengers' feet.\\r\\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of anachronisms. The main one is the placing of a \\"modern\\", 20th-century society in prehistory. This society takes inspiration from the suburban sprawl developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals. They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them. Finally, the stone houses of this society are cookie-cutter homes positioned into typical neighborhoods.[9]\\r\\nAs a running gag, often the \\"prehistoric\\" analog to a modern machine uses an animal.[10]\\r\\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the program.[11]\\r\\nFred Flintstone physically resembles both the voice actor who played him, Alan Reed, and Jackie Gleason, whose series, The Honeymooners, inspired The Flintstones.[12] The voice of Barney Rubble was provided by voice actor Mel Blanc, though five episodes during the second season (the first, second, fifth, sixth, and ninth) employed Hanna-Barbera regular Daws Butler while Blanc was incapacitated by a near-fatal car accident. Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident. In the earliest episodes, Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart-aleck. After his recovery from the accident, Blanc used a deeper voice, quite similar to the voice of the Abominable Snowman he performed in other cartoons, and was shown as somewhat dopier than before.\\r\\nReed based Fred's voice upon Gleason's Honeymooners interpretation of Ralph Kramden, while Blanc, after a season of using a nasal, high-pitched voice for Barney, eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by Art Carney in his portrayal of Ed Norton. The first time the Art Carney-like voice was used was for a few seconds in \\"The Prowler\\" (the third episode produced).\\r\\nIn a 1986 Playboy interview, Gleason said Alan Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying The Honeymooners but decided to let it pass.[13] According to Henry Corden, a voice actor and a friend of Gleason's, \\"Jackie's lawyers told him he could probably have The Flintstones pulled right off the air. But they also told him, 'Do you want to be known as the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air? The guy who took away a show so many kids love, and so many parents love, too?'\\"[14]\\r\\nHenry Corden's voice became Fred's after Reed's death in 1977, starting with A Flintstone Christmas.[15] Corden had previously provided Fred's singing voice in The Man Called Flintstone[16] and later on The Flintstones children's records. Since 2000, Jeff Bergman, James Arnold Taylor, and Scott Innes (performing both Fred and Barney for Toshiba commercials) have performed the voice of Fred. Since Mel Blanc's death in 1989, Barney has been voiced by Jeff Bergman, Frank Welker, and Kevin Michael Richardson. Various additional character voices were created by Hal Smith, Allan Melvin, Janet Waldo, Daws Butler, and Howard Morris, among others.\\r\\nThe opening and closing credits theme during the first two seasons was called \\"Rise and Shine\\", a lively instrumental underscore accompanying Fred on his drive home from work. The tune resembled \\"The Bugs Bunny Overture (This Is It!)\\", the theme song of The Bugs Bunny Show, also airing on ABC at the time, and may have been the reason the theme was changed in the third season.[17] Starting in season 3, episode 3 (\\"Barney the Invisible\\"), the opening and closing credits theme was the familiar vocal \\"Meet the Flintstones\\". This version was recorded with a 22-piece jazz band, and a five-voice singing group called the Skip Jacks. The melody is derived from part of the 'B' section of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 17 Movement 2, composed in 1801/02.[18] The \\"Meet the Flintstones\\" opening was later added to the first two seasons for syndication. The musical underscores were credited to Hoyt Curtin for the show's first five seasons; Ted Nichols took over in 1965 for the final season.[17]\\r\\nThe idea of The Flintstones started after Hanna-Barbera produced The Huckleberry Hound Show and The Quick Draw McGraw Show. Although these programs were successful, they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series Tom and Jerry, which entertained both children and the adults who accompanied them. However, since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's output became labeled \\"kids only\\". Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated situation comedy.[19]\\r\\nBarbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies (a hillbilly theme was later incorporated into two Flintstones episodes, \\"The Bedrock Hillbillies\\" and \\"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\\"), Romans (Hanna-Barbera eventually created The Roman Holidays), pilgrims, and Indians as the settings for the two families before deciding on the Stone Age. According to Barbera, they settled on that because \\"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\\".[20] Under the working title The Flagstones, the family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \\"modern stone age family\\" to sponsors and the network.[21]:3 Animator Kenneth Muse, who worked on the Tom and Jerry cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of The Flintstones.\\r\\nThe show imitated and spoofed The Honeymooners, although the early voice characterization for Barney was that of Lou Costello.[22] William Hanna admitted that \\"At that time, The Honeymooners was the most popular show on the air, and for my bill, it was the funniest show on the air. The characters, I thought, were terrific. Now, that influenced greatly what we did with The Flintstones ... The Honeymooners was there, and we used that as a kind of basis for the concept.\\"[citation needed] However, Joseph Barbera disavowed these claims in a separate interview, stating that, \\"I don't remember mentioning The Honeymooners when I sold the show. But if people want to compare The Flintstones to The Honeymooners, then great. It's a total compliment. The Honeymooners was one of the greatest shows ever written.\\"[23] Jackie Gleason, creator of The Honeymooners, considered suing Hanna-Barbera Productions, but decided that he did not want to be known as \\"the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air\\".[24][25] Another influence was noted during Hanna-Barbera's tenure at MGM, where they were in a friendly competition with fellow cartoon director Tex Avery. In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \\"The First Bad Man\\" (narrated by cowboy legend Tex Ritter). The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age Dallas. Many of the visual jokes antedated by many years similar ones used by Hanna-Barbera in the Flintstones series. Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed of the Flintstones.\\r\\nThe concept was also predated by the Stone Age Cartoons series of 12 animated cartoons released from January 1940 to September 1940 by Fleischer Studios. These cartoons show stone age people doing modern things with primitive means. One example is Granite Hotel including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.\\r\\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\\r\\nHere we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show. So we developed two storyboards; one was they had a helicopter of some kind and they went to the opera or whatever, and the other was Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble fighting over a swimming pool. So I go back to New York with a portfolio and two half-hour boards. And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did Bristol-Myers, the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \\"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \\"This is the worst, those guys....\\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.[20]\\r\\nWhen the series went into production, the working title The Flagstones was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, characters in the comic strip Hi and Lois. After spending a brief period in development as The Gladstones (GLadstone being a Los Angeles telephone exchange at the time),[26] Hanna-Barbera settled upon The Flintstones, and the idea of the Flintstones having a child from the start was discarded, with Fred and Wilma starting out as a childless couple. However, some early Flintstones merchandise, such as a 1961 Little Golden Book, included Fred Jr., before it was decided on his removal.[27]\\r\\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences, which was reflected in the comedy writing, which, as noted, resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era, with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a laugh track. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer Joanna Lee while still using traditional animation story men such as Warren Foster and Michael Maltese.\\r\\nThe Flintstones premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. For comparison, the first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first-ever sitcom: 1947's Mary Kay and Johnny.[28]\\r\\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by Winston cigarettes and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston[29] (dictated by the custom, at that time, that the star(s) of a TV series often \\"pitched\\" their sponsor's product in an \\"integrated commercial\\" at the end of the episode).[30]\\r\\nDuring the third season, Hanna and Barbera decided that Fred and Wilma should have a baby. Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \\"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\\".[19] Although most Flintstones episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a story arc surrounding the birth of Pebbles. Beginning with the episode \\"The Surprise\\", aired midway through the third season (January 25, 1963), in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles' birth in the episode \\"Dress Rehearsal\\" (February 22, 1963), and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and Welch's (grape juice and grape jellies) became the primary sponsor. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars which were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and characters from the show. In Australia, the Nine Network ran a \\"Name the Flintstones' baby\\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes ÿ few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past Flintstone episodes.\\r\\nAnother arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own (making The Flintstones the first animated series in history to address the issue of infertility, though subtly), adopt Bamm-Bamm. The 100th episode made (but the 90th to air), \\"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\\" (October 3, 1963), established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it but aired afterwards, which explains why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \\"Daddies Anonymous\\" (Bamm-Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98, \\"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\\"). Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo (voiced by Harvey Korman ).\\r\\nAfter Pebbles' birth, the tone and writing became more juvenile and ratings from the adult demographic began to decline. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.[31]\\r\\nThe first three seasons of The Flintstones aired Friday nights at 8:30 on ABC. Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30. The rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\\r\\nIn the U.S., syndicated reruns of the series were offered to local stations until 1997, when E/I regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of Ted Turner's purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1992 until around 1999, TBS, TNT, and Cartoon Network aired the program. In 2000, the program moved to Boomerang, where it aired until no later than 2016 (in its last years on the channel, it had been relegated to a graveyard slot). Online, the series was made available on the In2TV service beginning in 2006, then the online version of Kids' WB until that service was discontinued in 2015. As of 2017, full episodes are only available in the U.S. on Boomerang's subscription video on demand service, with select clips made available on an official YouTube account tied to the revamped Kids' WB Web site.\\r\\nThe night after The Flintstones premiered, Variety called it \\"A pen and ink disaster\\",[32] and as late as the 1980s, highbrow critics derided the show's limited animation and derivative plots.[33] Despite the mixed critical reviews at first, The Flintstones has generally been considered a television classic and was rerun continuously for five decades after its end. In 1961, The Flintstones became the first animated series to be nominated for an Outstanding Comedy Series Primetime Emmy Award, but lost out to The Jack Benny Show. In January 2009, IGN named The Flintstones as the ninth-best in its \\"Top 100 Animated TV Shows\\".[34]\\r\\nFollowing the show's cancellation in 1966, a film based upon the series was created. The Man Called Flintstone was a musical spy caper that parodied James Bond and other secret agents. The movie was released to theaters on August 3, 1966, by Columbia Pictures.[36] It was released on DVD in Canada in March 2005 and in United States in December 2008.\\r\\nThe show was revived in the early 1970s with Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm having grown into teenagers, and several different series and made-for-TV movies (broadcast mainly on Saturday mornings, with a few shown in prime time); including a series depicting Fred and Barney as police officers, another depicting the characters as children, and yet others featuring Fred and Barney encountering Marvel Comics superhero The Thing and Al Capp's comic strip character The Shmoo?ÿ have appeared over the years. The original show also was adapted into a live-action film in 1994, and a prequel, The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, which followed in 2000. Unlike its sister show The Jetsons (the two shows appeared in a made-for-TV crossover movie in 1987), the revival programs were not widely syndicated or rerun alongside the original series.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2011, it was announced the Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane would be reviving The Flintstones for the Fox network, with the first episode airing in 2013.[37] After Fox Entertainment president Kevin Reilly read the pilot script and \\"liked it but didn't love it\\", MacFarlane chose to abandon work on the project rather than restarting it.[38][39]\\r\\nIn May 2013, Warner Bros. Animation and WWE Studios announced a Flintstones animated film. The film was to involve a \\"prehistoric WWE main event\\"[40] and feature the voices of The Undertaker, Vince McMahon, John Cena, Rey Mysterio, and CM Punk. The film was released direct-to-video in early 2015.[40]\\r\\nIn May 2014, it was reported that Will Ferrell and Adam McKay will produce an animated Flintstones movie for Warner Animation Group.[41]\\r\\nTwo Flintstones-themed amusement parks exist in the United States: Bedrock City in Custer, South Dakota, and another in Valle, Arizona. Both have been in operation for decades. Bedrock City, also known as Flintstone Park, closed in August 2015.[citation needed]\\r\\nAnother existed until the 1990s at Carowinds in Charlotte, North Carolina. In Canada, Flintstone Park in Kelowna, British Columbia, opened in 1968 and closed in 1998; it was notable for the \\"Forty Foot Fred\\" statue of Fred Flintstone which was a well known Kelowna landmark.[42][43] Another Flintstones park was located in Bridal Falls, British Columbia, which closed in 1990.[44] Calaway Park outside Calgary, Alberta, Canada, also opened with a Flintstones theme and many of the buildings today have a caveman-like design, though the park does not license the characters. The Australia's Wonderland and Canada's Wonderland theme parks, both featured Flintstones characters in their Hanna-Barbera-themed children's sections from 1985 up until the mid-1990s. Kings Island near Cincinnati, Ohio, had a Hanna-Barbera land, in which many Hanna-Barbera characters were featured, including the Flintstones, in the 1980s and early 1990s.\\r\\nA stage production opened at Universal Studios Hollywood in 1994 (the year the live-action film was released), developed by Universal and Hanna-Barbera Productions. It opened at the Panasonic Theater, replacing the Star Trek show. The story consists of Fred, Wilma, Barney, and Betty heading for \\"Hollyrock\\". The show ran until January 2, 1997.\\r\\nMiles Laboratories (now part of Bayer Corporation) and their One-A-Day vitamin brand was the alternate sponsor of the original Flintstones series during its first two seasons, and in the late 1960s, Miles introduced Flintstones Chewable Vitamins, fruit-flavored multivitamin tablets for children in the shape of the Flintstones characters, which are currently being sold.[45]\\r\\nThe Simpsons referenced The Flintstones in several episodes. In the episode \\"Homer's Night Out\\", Homer's local convenience store clerk, Apu, remarks \\"You look familiar, sir.

He played 21 seasons for the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves in the National League (NL) and two seasons for the Milwaukee Brewers in the American League (AL), from 1954 through 1976. Aaron held the MLB record for career home runs for 33 years, and he still holds several MLB offensive records. He hit 24 or more home runs every year from 1955 through 1973, and is one of only two players to hit 30 or more home runs in a season at least fifteen times.[1] In 1999, The Sporting News ranked Aaron fifth on its \\"100 Greatest Baseball Players\\" list.\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron was born and raised in and around Mobile, Alabama. Aaron had seven siblings, including Tommie Aaron, who later played in MLB with him. He appeared briefly in the Negro American League and in minor league baseball before starting his major league career.[2] By his final MLB season, Aaron was the last Negro league baseball player on a major league roster.\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron played the vast majority of his MLB games in right field, though he appeared at several other infield and outfield positions. In his last two seasons, he was primarily a designated hitter.[3] Aaron was an NL All-Star for 20 seasons and an AL All-Star for 1 season, from 1955 through 1975.  Aaron holds the record for the most seasons as an All-Star and the most All-Star Game selections (25),[a] and is tied with Willie Mays and Stan Musial for the most All-Star Games played (24). He was a Gold Glove winner for three seasons. In 1957, he was the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) when the Milwaukee Braves won the World Series. He won the NL Player of the Month award in May 1958 and June 1967. Aaron holds the MLB records for the most career runs batted in (RBI) (2,297), extra base hits (1,477), and total bases (6,856). Aaron is also in the top five for career hits (3,771) and runs (2,174). He is one of only four players to have at least seventeen seasons with 150 or more hits.[4] Aaron is in second place in home runs (755) and at-bats (12,364), and in third place in games played (3,298). At the time of his retirement, Aaron held most of the game's key career power hitting records.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince his retirement, Aaron has held front office roles with the Atlanta Braves. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. In 1999, MLB introduced the Hank Aaron Award to recognize the top offensive players in each league. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. He was named a 2010 Georgia Trustee by the Georgia Historical Society in recognition of accomplishments that reflect the ideals of Georgia's founders. Aaron resides near Atlanta.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron was born in Mobile, Alabama, to Herbert Aaron, Sr. and Estella Aaron.[6][7] He had seven siblings.[6] Tommie Aaron, one of his brothers, also went on to play Major League Baseball. By the time Aaron retired, he and his brother held the record for most career home runs by a pair of siblings (768). They were also the first siblings to appear in a League Championship Series as teammates.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was born in a section of Mobile referred to as \\"Down the Bay\\", he spent most of his youth in Toulminville. Aaron grew up in a poor family.[6]  His family could not afford baseball equipment, so he practiced by hitting bottle caps with sticks. He would create his own bats and balls out of materials he found on the streets.[9] His boyhood idol was baseball star Jackie Robinson.[10] Aaron attended Central High School as a freshman and a sophomore. Like most high schools they did not have organized baseball, and so he played outfield and third base for the Mobile Black Bears, a semipro team.[11] Aaron was a member of the Boy Scouts of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough he batted cross-handed (i.e., as a right-handed hitter, with his left hand above his right), Aaron established himself as a power hitter. As a result, in 1949, at the age of fifteen, Aaron had his first tryout with an MLB franchise, the Brooklyn Dodgers; however, he did not make the team.[2][12] After this, Aaron returned to school to finish his secondary education, attending the Josephine Allen Institute, a private high school in Alabama. During his junior year, Aaron first joined the Pritchett Athletics,[12] followed by the Mobile Black Bears, an independent Negro league team.[6] While on the Bears, Aaron earned $3 per game ($94 today), which was a dollar more than he got while on the Athletics.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 20, 1951, baseball scout Ed Scott signed Aaron to a contract on behalf of the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro American League where he played three months.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started play as a 6 feet (180?cm), 180 pounds (82?kg), shortstop,[15]  and earned $200 per month.[16] As a result of his standout play with the Indianapolis Clowns, Aaron received two offers from MLB teams via telegram, one from the New York Giants and the other from the Boston Braves. Years later, Aaron remembered:\\r\\n\\r\\nI had the Giants' contract in my hand. But the Braves offered fifty dollars a month more. That's the only thing that kept Willie Mays and me from being teammates?ÿ fifty dollars.[17]\\r\\nWhile with the Clowns he experienced some overt racism. His team was in Washington, D.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had breakfast while we were waiting for the rain to stop, and I can still envision sitting with the Clowns in a restaurant behind Griffith Stadium and hearing them break all the plates in the kitchen after we finished eating. What a horrible sound. Even as a kid, the irony of it hit me: here we were in the capital in the land of freedom and equality, and they had to destroy the plates that had touched the forks that had been in the mouths of black men. If dogs had eaten off those plates, they'd have washed them.[18]\\r\\nThe Howe Sports Bureau credits Aaron with a .366 batting average in 26 official Negro league games, with 5 home runs, 33 runs batted in (RBI), 41 hits, and 9 stolen bases.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Braves purchased Aaron from the Clowns for $10,000,[20]  which GM John Quinn thought was a steal as he stated that he felt that Aaron was a $100,000 property.[16] On June 12, 1952, Aaron signed with Braves' scout Dewey Griggs.[16]  During this time, he picked up the nickname 'pork chops' because it \\"was the only thing I knew to order off the menu.\\"[21] A teammate later said, \\"the man ate pork chops three meals a day, two for breakfast.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Braves assigned Aaron to the Eau Claire Bears, the Braves' Northern League Class-C farm team.[6] The 1952 season proved to be very beneficial for Aaron. Playing in the infield, Aaron continued to develop as a ballplayer and made the Northern League's All-Star team.[6] He broke his habit of hitting cross-handed and adopted the standard hitting technique. By the end of the season, he had performed so well that the league made him the unanimous choice for Rookie of the Year.[2][6]  Although he appeared in just 87 games, he scored 89 runs, had 116 hits, nine home runs, and 61 RBI.[6] In addition, Aaron hit for a .336 batting average.[6] During his minor league experience, he was very homesick and faced constant racism, but his brother, Herbert Jr., told him not to give up the opportunity.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1953, the Braves promoted him to the Jacksonville Braves, their Class-A affiliate in the South Atlantic League.[6] Helped by Aaron's performance, the Braves won the league championship that year. Aaron led the league in runs (115), hits (208), doubles (36), RBI (125), total bases (338), and batting average (.362).[6] He won the league's Most Valuable Player Award.[6][11] and had such a dominant year that one sportswriter was prompted to say, \\"Henry Aaron led the league in everything except hotel accommodations.\\"[24] Aaron's time with the Braves did not come without problems. He was one of the first African Americans to play in the league.[25] The 1950s were a period of racial segregation in parts of the United States, especially the southeastern portion of the country. When Aaron traveled around Jacksonville, Florida, and the surrounding areas, he was often separated from his team because of Jim Crow laws. In most circumstances, the team was responsible for arranging housing and meals for its players, but Aaron often had to make his own arrangements.[26] The Braves' manager, Ben Geraghty, tried his best to help Aaron on and off the field. Former Braves minor league player and sportswriter Pat Jordan said, \\"Aaron gave [Geraghty] much of the credit for his own swift rise to stardom.\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat same year, Aaron met his future wife, Barbara Lucas. The night they met, Lucas decided to attend the Braves' game. Aaron singled, doubled, and hit a home run in the game. On October 6, Aaron and Lucas married.[28] In 1958, Aaron's wife noted that during the offseason he liked \\"to sit and watch those shooting westerns.\\" He also enjoyed cooking and fishing.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron spent the winter of 1953 playing in Puerto Rico. Mickey Owen, the team's manager, helped Aaron with his batting stance. Up to that time, Aaron hit most pitches to left field or center field, but after working with Owen, Aaron was able to hit the ball more effectively all over the field.[2][better?source?needed] During his stay in Puerto Rico, Owen also helped Aaron to transition from second baseman to outfielder. Aaron had not played well at second base, but Owen had noted that Aaron could catch fly balls and throw the ball well from the outfield to the infield.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stint in Puerto Rico also allowed Aaron to avoid being drafted into military service. Though the Korean War was over, people were still being drafted. The Braves were able to speak to the draft board, making the case that Aaron could be the player to integrate the Southern Association the following season with the Atlanta Crackers. The board appears to have been convinced, as Aaron was not drafted.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\n1954 saw Aaron attending spring training with the major league club. Although he was on the roster of its farm club, Milwaukee manager Charley Grimm later stated, \\"From the start, he did so well I knew we were going to have to carry him.\\"[16] On March 13, 1954, Milwaukee Braves left fielder Bobby Thomson fractured his ankle while sliding into second base during a spring training game. The next day, Aaron made his first spring training start for the Braves' major league team, playing in left field and hitting a home run.[11] This led Hank Aaron to a major league contract, signed on the final day of spring training, and a Braves uniform with the number five.[30] On April 13, Aaron made his major league debut and was hitless in five at-bats against the Cincinnati Reds' left-hander Joe Nuxhall.[31] In the same game, Eddie Mathews hit two home runs, the first of a record 863 home runs the pair would hit as teammates. On April 15, Aaron collected his first major league hit, a double off Cardinals' pitcher Vic Raschi.[32]  Aaron hit his first major league home run on April 23, also off Raschi.[6] Over the next 122 games, Aaron batted .280 with thirteen homers before he suffered a fractured ankle on September 5. He then changed his number to 44, which would turn out to look like a \\"lucky number\\" for the slugger. Aaron would hit 44 home runs in four different seasons,[33] and he hit his record-breaking 715th career home run off Dodgers pitcher Al Downing, who coincidentally also wore number 44.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, Aaron was known to family and friends primarily as \\"Henry.\\" Braves' public relations director Don Davidson, observing Aaron's quiet, reserved nature, began referring to him publicly as \\"Hank\\" in order to suggest more accessibility. The nickname quickly gained currency, but \\"Henry\\" continued to be cited frequently in the media, both sometimes appearing in the same article, and Aaron would answer to either one. During his rookie year, his other well-known nicknames, \\"Hammerin' Hank\\" (by teammates) and \\"Bad Henry\\" (by opposing pitchers) are reported to have arisen.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron hit .314 with 27 home runs and 106 RBI, in 1955. He was named to the NL All-Star roster for the first time; it was the first of a record 21 All-Star selections and first of a record 25 All-Star Game appearances.[36][37]  In 1956, Aaron hit .328 and captured the first of two NL batting titles. He was also named The Sporting News NL Player of the Year. In 1957, Aaron won his only NL MVP Award,[6] as he had his first brush with the triple crown.[38] He batted .322, placing third, and led the league in home runs and runs batted in.[6] On September 23, 1957, Aaron hit a two-run game-ending home run in Milwaukee, clinching the pennant for the Braves and being carried off the field by his teammates. Milwaukee went on to win the World Series against the New York Yankees, the defending champions.[6] Aaron did his part by hitting .393 with three homers and seven RBI. On December 15, 1957, his wife gave birth to twins.[28] Two days later, one of the children died.[28] In 1958, Aaron hit .326, with 30 home runs and 95 RBI. He led the Braves to another pennant, but this time they lost a seven-game World Series to the Yankees. Aaron finished third in the MVP race and he received his first of three Gold Glove Awards. During the next several years, Aaron had some of his best games and best seasons as a major league player. On June 21, 1959, against the San Francisco Giants, he hit three two-run home runs. It was the only time in his career that he hit three home runs in a game.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963, Aaron nearly won the triple crown. He led the league with 44 home runs and 130 RBI and finished third in batting average.[nb 1] In that season, Aaron became the third player to steal 30 bases and hit 30 home runs in a single season. Despite that, he again finished third in the MVP voting. The Braves moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta after the 1965 season. On May 10, 1967, he hit an inside-the-park home run against Jim Bunning in Philadelphia. It was his only inside-the-park home run of his career. [40] In 1968, Aaron was the first Atlanta Braves player to hit his 500th career home run, and in 1970, he was the first Atlanta Brave to reach 3,000 career hits.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his days in Atlanta, Aaron reached a number of milestones; he was only the eighth player ever to hit 500 career home runs, with his 500th coming against Mike McCormick of the San Francisco Giants on July 14, 1968exactly one year after former Milwaukee Braves teammate Eddie Mathews had hit his 500th.[42] Aaron was, at the time, the second-youngest player to reach that plateau.[nb 2] On July 31, 1969, Aaron hit his 537th home run, passing Mickey Mantle's total; this moved Aaron into third place on the career home run list, after Willie Mays and Babe Ruth. At the end of the 1969 season, Aaron again finished third in the MVP voting.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970, Aaron reached two more career milestones. On May 17, Aaron collected his 3,000th hit, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, the team against which he played in his first major-league game.[43] Aaron established the record for most seasons with thirty or more home runs in the National League. On April 27, 1971, Aaron hit his 600th career home run, the third major league player ever to do so. On July 13, Aaron hit a home run in the All-Star Game (played at Detroit's Tiger Stadium) for the first time. He hit his 40th home run of the season against the Giants' Jerry Johnson on August 10, which established a National League record for most seasons with 40 or more home runs (seven). At age 37, he hit a career-high 47 home runs during the season (along with a career-high .669 slugging percentage) and finished third in MVP voting for the sixth time. During the strike-shortened season of 1972, Aaron tied and then surpassed Willie Mays for second place on the career home run list. Aaron also knocked in the 2,000th run of his career and hit a home run in the first All-Star game played in Atlanta. As the year came to a close, Aaron broke Stan Musial's major-league record for total bases (6,134). Aaron finished the season with 673 home runs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron himself downplayed the \\"chase\\" to surpass Babe Ruth, while baseball enthusiasts and the national media grew increasingly excited as he closed in on the 714 career home runs record. Aaron received thousands of letters every week during the summer of 1973, including hate mail; the Braves ended up hiring a secretary to help him sort through it.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron (then age 39) hit 40 home runs in 392 at-bats, ending the 1973 season one home run short of the record. He hit home run number 713 on September 29, 1973, and with one day remaining in the season, many expected him to tie the record. But in his final game that year, playing against the Houston Astros (managed by Leo Durocher, who had once roomed with Babe Ruth), he was unable to achieve this. After the game, Aaron stated that his only fear was that he might not live to see the 1974 season. [45]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was the recipient of death threats during the 1973ÿ1974 offseason and a large assortment of hate mail from people who did not want to see Aaron break Ruth's nearly sacrosanct home run record.[46] The threats extended to those providing positive press coverage of Aaron. Lewis Grizzard, then sports editor of the Atlanta Journal, reported receiving numerous phone calls calling journalists \\"nigger lovers\\" for covering Aaron's chase. While preparing the massive coverage of the home run record, he quietly had an obituary written, afraid that Aaron might be murdered.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nSports Illustrated pointedly summarized the racist vitriol that Aaron was forced to endure:\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this to be the year in which Aaron, at the age of thirty-nine, takes a moon walk above one of the most hallowed individual records in American sport...? Or will it be remembered as the season in which Aaron, the most dignified of athletes, was besieged with hate mail and trapped by the cobwebs and goblins that lurk in baseball's attic?[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the 1973 season, Aaron received a plaque from the US Postal Service for receiving more mail (930,000 pieces) than any person excluding politicians.[18] Aaron received an outpouring of public support in response to the bigotry. Newspaper cartoonist Charles Schulz created a series of Peanuts strips printed in August 1973 in which Snoopy attempts to break the Ruth record, only to be besieged with hate mail. Lucy says in the August 11 strip, \\"Hank Aaron is a great player...but you! If you break Babe Ruth's record, it'll be a disgrace!\\" Coincidentally, Snoopy was only one home run short of tying the record (and finished the season as such when Charlie Brown got picked off during Snoopy's last at-bat), and as it turned out, Aaron finished the 1973 season one home run short of Ruth.[49] Babe Ruth's widow, Claire Hodgson, even denounced the racism and declared that her husband would have enthusiastically cheered Aaron's attempt at the record.[50] As the 1974 season began, Aaron's pursuit of the record caused a small controversy. The Braves opened the season on the road in Cincinnati with a three-game series against the Cincinnati Reds. Braves management wanted him to break the record in Atlanta, and were therefore going to have Aaron sit out the first three games of the season. But Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn ruled that he had to play two games in the first series. He played two out of three, tying Babe Ruth's record, 4 April 1974, in his very first at baton his first swing of the seasonoff Reds pitcher Jack Billingham, but did not hit another home run in the series.[51]\\r\\nThe Braves returned to Atlanta, and on April 8, 1974, a crowd of 53,775 people showed up for the gamea Braves attendance record. The game was also broadcast nationally on NBC. In the fourth inning, Aaron hit home run number 715 off Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Al Downing.[6] Although Dodgers outfielder Bill Buckner nearly went over the outfield wall trying to catch it, the ball landed in the Braves' bullpen, where relief pitcher Tom House caught it. While cannons were fired in celebration, two college students [52] sprinted onto the field and jogged alongside Aaron for part of his circuit around the bases, temporarily startling him. A very youthful Craig Sager actually interviewed Aaron between third and home for a television station, WXLT (now WWSB-Channel 40) in Sarasota.[53] As the fans cheered wildly, Aaron's parents ran onto the field as well. Braves announcer Milo Hamilton, calling the game on WSB radio, described the scene as Aaron broke the record: \\"Henry Aaron, in the second inning walked and scored. He's sittin' on 714. Here's the pitch by Downing. Swinging. There's a drive into left-center field. That ball is gonna be-eee... Outta here! It's gone! It's 715! There's a new home run champion of all time, and it's Henry Aaron! The fireworks are going. Henry Aaron is coming around third. His teammates are at home plate. And listen to this crowd!\\"[54] Meanwhile, Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully addressed the racial tensionor apparent lack thereofin his call of the home run: \\"What a marvelous moment for baseball; what a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia; what a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of us, and particularly for Henry Aaron. ... And for the first time in a long time, that poker face in Aaron shows the tremendous strain and relief of what it must have been like to live with for the past several months.\\"[55] On October 2, 1974, Aaron hit his 733rd and final home run as a Braves player.[56] Thirty days later, after Aaron decided not to retire, the Braves traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers for Roger Alexander and Dave May. The trade re-united Aaron with former teammate Del Crandall, who was now managing the Brewers. On May 1, 1975, Aaron broke baseball's all-time RBI record, previously held by Ruth with 2,213. That year, he also played in his last and 24th All-Star Game (25th All-Star Game selection[57]); he lined out to Dave Concepci܇n as a pinch-hitter in the second inning. This All-Star Game, like the first one he played in 1955, was before a home crowd at Milwaukee County Stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron hit his 755th and final home run on July 20, 1976, at Milwaukee County Stadium off Dick Drago of the California Angels, which stood as the MLB career home run record until it was broken in 2007 by Barry Bonds. Over the course of his record-breaking 23-year career, Aaron had a batting average of .305 with 163 hits a season, while hitting an average of just over 32 home runs a year and knocking home 99 runs batted in (RBIs) a year. He had 100+ RBIs in a season 15 times, including a record 13 in a row.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 1976 season, Aaron rejoined the Braves as an executive.[15] On August 1, 1982, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, having received votes on 97.8 percent of the ballots, second only to Ty Cobb, who had received votes on 98.2% of the ballot in the inaugural 1936 Hall of Fame election.[58] Aaron was then named the Braves' vice president and director of player development. This made him one of the first minorities in Major League Baseball upper-level management.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince December 1980, he has served as senior vice president and assistant to the Braves' president.[24]  He is the corporate vice president of community relations for TBS, a member of the company's board of directors and the vice president of business development for The Airport Network.[24] On January 21, 2007, Major League Baseball announced the sale of the Atlanta Braves. In that announcement, Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig also announced that Aaron would be playing a major role in the management of Braves, forming programs through major league baseball that will encourage the influx of minorities into baseball.[59] Aaron founded the Hank Aaron Rookie League program.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis autobiography, I Had a Hammer was published in 1990. The book's title is a play on his nickname, \\"The Hammer\\" or \\"Hammerin' Hank\\", and the title of the folk song \\"If I Had a Hammer\\". Aaron now owns Hank Aaron BMW of south Atlanta in Union City, Georgia, where he gives an autographed baseball with every car sold.[61] Aaron also owns Mini, Land Rover, Toyota, Hyundai and Honda dealerships throughout Georgia, as part of the Hank Aaron Automotive Group. Aaron sold all but the Toyota dealership in McDonough in 2007. Additionally, Aaron owns a chain of 30 restaurants around the country. During the 2006 season, San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds passed Babe Ruth and moved into second place on the all-time home run list, attracting growing media coverage as he drew closer to Aaron's record. Playing off the intense interest in their perceived rivalry, Aaron and Bonds made a television commercial that aired during Super Bowl XLI, shortly before the start of the 2007 baseball season, in which Aaron jokingly tried to persuade Bonds to retire before breaking the record.[62] As Bonds began to close in on the record during the 2007 season, Aaron let it be known that, although he recognized Bonds' achievements, he would not be present when Bonds broke the record.[63]  There was considerable speculation that this was a snubbing of Bonds based on the widespread belief that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs and steroids to aid his achievement. However, some observers looked back on Aaron's personal history, pointing out that he had downplayed his own breaking of Babe Ruth's all-time record and suggesting that Aaron was simply treating Bonds in a similar fashion. In a later interview with Atlanta sportscasting personality Chris Dimino, Aaron made it clear that his reluctance to attend any celebration of a new home run record was based upon his personal conviction that baseball is not about breaking records, but simply playing to the best of one's potential.[63] After Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run on August 7, 2007, Aaron made a surprise appearance on the JumboTron video screen at AT&T Park in San Francisco to congratulate Bonds on his accomplishment:\\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to offer my congratulations to Barry Bonds on becoming baseball's career home run leader. It is a great accomplishment which required skill, longevity, and determination. Throughout the past century, the home run has held a special place in baseball and I have been privileged to hold this record for 33 of those years. I move over now and offer my best wishes to Barry and his family on this historical achievement. My hope today, as it was on that April evening in 1974, is that the achievement of this record will inspire others to chase their own dreams.\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron lives in the Atlanta area.[64] In July 2013, media reported that his home was burglarized. Jewelry and two BMW vehicles were stolen. The cars were later recovered.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron was awarded the Spingarn Medal in 1976, from the NAACP.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982, Aaron was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame during his first year of eligibility. In 1988 Aaron was inducted into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame for his time spent on the Milwaukee Braves.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, MLB created the Hank Aaron Award, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Aaron's surpassing of Babe Ruth's career home run mark of 714 home runs and to honor Aaron's contributions to baseball. The award is given annually to the baseball hitters voted the most effective in each respective league. That same year, baseball fans named Aaron to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Hank Aaron on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the city of Atlanta was converting Centennial Olympic Stadium into a new baseball stadium, many local residents hoped the stadium would be named for Hank Aaron. When the stadium was instead named Turner Field (after Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner), a section of Capitol Avenue running past the stadium was renamed Hank Aaron Drive. The stadium's street number is 755, after Aaron's total number of home runs; the 755 street number was retained for Turner Field's replacement, SunTrust Park. In April 1997, a new baseball facility for the AA Mobile Bay Bears constructed in Aaron's hometown of Mobile, Alabama was named Hank Aaron Stadium.[67] Georgia State University acquired Turner Field, since rebuilt as Georgia State Stadium, in 2017, and university officials plan to build a new baseball park on the former AtlantaÿFulton County Stadium site, incorporating the left field wall where Aaron hit his record-breaking home run.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 5, 1999, at his 65th birthday celebration, Major League Baseball announced the introduction of the Hank Aaron Award.[68] The award honors the best overall offensive performer in the American and National League. It was the first major award to be introduced in more than thirty years and had the distinction of being the first award named after a player who was still alive.[69] Later that year, he ranked fifth on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[70] and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2000 and again in July 2002, Aaron threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, played at Turner Field and Miller Park, respectively.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 8, 2001, Hank Aaron was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton.[73] He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, from President George W. Bush in June 2002.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, a recreational trail in Milwaukee connecting Miller Park with Lake Michigan along the Menomonee River was dedicated as the \\"Hank Aaron State Trail\\". Hank Aaron was on hand for the dedication. Aaron is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, Aaron was honored with the \\"Lombardi Award of Excellence\\" from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Coach Lombardi's legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the Coach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAaron dedicated the new exhibit \\"Hank Aaron-Chasing the Dream\\" at the Baseball Hall of Fame on April 25, 2009.[76] Statues of Aaron stand outside the front entrance of both Turner Field and Miller Park. There is also a statue of him as an eighteen-year-old shortstop outside Carson Park in Eau Claire, Wisconsin,[77] where he played his first season in the Braves' minor league system.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was named a 2010 Georgia Trustee by the Georgia Historical Society, in conjunction with the Governor of Georgia, to recognize accomplishments and community service that reflect the ideals of the founding body of Trustees, which governed the Georgia colony from 1732 to 1752.[78] Aaron received the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Rosette in January 2016.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nItalics denotes active player\\r\\n\\r\\nItalics denotes active player","input":"When was hank aaron inducted into the hall of fame?"},{"output":"Texas","context":"This is a complete list of the states of the United States and its major territories ordered by total area, land area, and water area.

Self-described as lovable, cute and furry, he is a blue monster who rarely uses contractions when he speaks or sings. Grover was originally performed by Frank Oz from his earliest appearances. Eric Jacobson began performing Grover in 1998; he has performed the character regularly since 2001, although Oz still performs him occasionally but not usually.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA prototype version of Grover appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in a Christmas Eve appearance in 1967. This puppet had greenish-brown fur and a red nose. He also had a raspier voice, and was played a bit more unkempt than Grover would later behave. The monster was referred to as \\"Gleep\\", a monster in Santa's workshop. He later made a cameo appearance in The Muppets On Puppets in 1968 with the Rock and Roll Monster. In 1969, clad in a necktie, he appeared in the Sesame Street Pitch Reel in the board room sequences. During the first season of Sesame Street, the character was nicknamed \\"Fuzzyface\\" or \\"The Hairy One\\", though neither would be used for his actual name. In his book The Tipping Point, author Malcolm Gladwell notes that the character \\"was used in promotional films for IBM.\\"\\r\\nIn an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on May 31, 1970, the character acquired his present name and his appearance was changed to the more familiar puppet with blue fur and a pink nose. In this appearance, Kermit the Frog tried to sing \\"What Kind of Fool Am I?\\" (accompanying himself on piano), but Grover repeatedly interrupted him. The true Grover \\"officially\\" debuted in the second season of Sesame Street.\\r\\nOne of the more frequent sketch segments featuring Grover involves him taking a series of customer service jobs. One of his customers is always Mr. Johnson, a balding, mustachioed customer who invariably becomes frustrated at Grover's poor service and/or his (Grover's) insistence that he is serving him properly.\\r\\nThe first Grover-Mr. Johnson series of sketches, set at \\"Charlie's Restaurant,\\" aired in the early 1970s; here, Grover is employed as a waiter and Mr. Johnson is his customer. The sketches followed the same basic premise: Mr. Johnson would order a menu item, Grover would serve the customer, a disagreement results (usually) as a result of Grover's mistakes, and Grover attempting (often, more than once) to correct the mistake with varying degrees of success. Under this backdrop, the sketches served to teach the childhood audience basic concepts such as same and different, big and little, hot and cold, the alphabet, following directions and patience, among other things.\\r\\nRepeats of the \\"Charlie's Restaurant\\" series of sketches aired for many years on Sesame Street. In the years since, new Grover-Mr. Johnson sketches have been produced, with Grover taking other customer service jobs and Mr. Johnson as his hapless customer. Every time, Mr. Johnson recognizes Grover as \\"that waiter from Charlie's.\\" Grover's jobs have ranged from that of a taxi driver and a photographer to a flight attendant and singing telegram artist. One sketch parodied the ABC television series Extreme Makeover: Home Edition in a segment where Grover began remodeling Mr. Johnson's home against his express wishes. In another one, Mr. Johnson is the only patron ,and Grover is the only actor, for a production of Spider-Monster: The Musical, a parody of the musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. The play is, of course, a complete calamity and finally comes crashing down on both of them.\\r\\nGrover also has an instructional persona who wears a cap and gown to provide educational context for simple, everyday things. His lessons are often wrong, leaving himself open to correction by a group of children or Muppets. This, combined with the failings of the Super Grover character, means that Grover can be very self-conscious and timid. He is often a source of slapstick humor and often accidentally injures himself.\\r\\nEarly in the series, Grover would often greet Kermit the Frog by running up to him and yelling, \\"Hey, froggy babeee!\\" and then giving him a hard slap on the back, which knocked him over.\\r\\nGlobal Grover is a more recent series of segments, in which Grover hosts a trip to a foreign country to learn about their culture and customs.\\r\\nIn 2010, Grover starred in a parody of an Old Spice Commercial called \\"Smell Like a Monster\\" based on \\"The Man Your Man Could Smell Like\\", where a clam with \\"two tickets to the thing you love\\" bit his nose and he rode a cow rather than a horse.\\r\\nGrover has a semi-secret superhero identity as the well-meaning but inept Super Grover, sometimes presented as the alter ego of Grover Kent, \\"ace doorknob salesman for Acme, Inc\\". Originally his superhero costume consisted of a pink cape and medieval knight's helmet, with a Superman-style crest on both the cape and his T-shirt, bearing a letter \\"G\\" on his chest instead of \\"S\\". During the 1970s and 1980s, Sesame Street ran a series of Super Grover sketches spoofing the classic Adventures of Superman series (in the opening of these, his name was hyphenated \\"Super-Grover\\"). An announcer (Jerry Nelson) introduced each episode with the lines:\\r\\n\\"Presenting the further adventures of everybody's favorite hero. The man who is faster than lightning, stronger than steel, smarter than a speeding bullet. It's... Super Grover!\\"\\r\\nWith that, a fanfare sounds, Super Grover bursts through a paper wall bearing his crest, fruitlessly tries to move his helmet up off his eyes, and adds, \\"And I am cute, too!\\"\\r\\nAnnouncer: And now, on to our story.\\r\\nSuper Grover: Yes! On to our story!\\r\\nFrom there, episodes followed a simple formula: Super Grover is flying somewhere over Metro City when he hears the cries of a Muppet child in some small trouble and immediately sails in to assist. The excited child is quickly disillusioned as Super Grover crash-lands nearby. From there, Grover continues to be enthusiastic but no help whatsoever, his \\"dramatic\\" feats of strength or speed serving only to kill time while the child solves the problem on their own and wanders off. By then, Grover's efforts have usually landed him in a comical predicament of his own.\\r\\nSuper Grover has appeared in the Sesame Street theatrical films Follow that Bird (1985) and The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland (1999, where it's revealed he stretches his arms out and spins into his costume in homage to Wonder Woman), as well as the 1983 PBS special Don't Eat the Pictures.\\r\\nFor Sesame Street's 41st season in 2010, the character was revamped as Super Grover 2.0, who debuted on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, flying in and crash-landing behind the chair where he was meant to sit. His new costume consists of a helmet reminiscent of a Spartan or Centurion, a red cape, and a black rubber vest resembling bike racing gear. Both the cape and the vest are adorned with his crest, now with a lightning bolt added behind the \\"G\\". Of course, the helmet has a hinged visor which still tends to fall over Grover's eyes. But now the tagline is Super Grover 2.0 - He Shows Up!\\r\\n\\"Grover's Mommy\\" plays an integral but often unrecognized role on Sesame Street. She has been seen almost exclusively in print, including the many illustrated books starring Grover. She was also occasionally seen in photographs, as a photo puppet, such as on the cover of Volume 4 of The Sesame Street Treasury. Over the course of time, her appearance has fluctuated greatly.\\r\\nHer earliest known appearance as a Muppet is a 1970s sketch in which Grover speaks to the audience about being afraid of the dark. At the end of the sketch, his mom (Frank Oz) enters his room to kiss him goodnight. Another early appearance (circa 1981) involves his mother (Kathryn Mullen) coming into the bathroom while Grover is telling the audience about how to take a bath.\\r\\nShe has recently appeared (performed by Stephanie D'Abruzzo) in a brief Elmo's World sequence (from the \\"Families\\" episode), with her son as his alter-ego Super Grover, as her own alter-ego, \\"Super-Mommy\\". Grover crashlands, screaming \\"Moooommy!\\" and his mom follows yelling \\"Soooonny!\\" crashing on top of him. They recover, acknowledge each other, and both faint.\\r\\nIn the 1971 children's book The Monster at the End of This Book, Grover goes to great effort to keep the reader from turning the pages of the book, because there is a monster on the final page. Grover nails pages together and builds a brick wall to block access; at the end it is discovered that the monster at the end of the book is Grover himself, who is mortified (\\"Oh, I am so embarrassed...\\"). The late 90s saw a sequel to the book where Grover desperately tries to stop Elmo from reaching the end of the book, eventually directing him to leave the book and enter from the back. Therefore, when both of them reach the end, they wind up scaring each other.\\r\\nAnother popular children's book, Would You like to Play Hide & Seek in This Book with Lovable, Furry Old Grover?, had Grover trying different ways to hide from the reader, eventually getting upset and begging the reader to just say \\"no\\" he doesn't see him, even though he was just crouching down in a corner.\\r\\nIn 1974, Grover went on a learning expedition in Grover and The Everything In The Whole Wide World Museum. He tours rooms such as \\"The Long Thin Things You Can Write With Room\\", as well as \\"The Things That Make So Much Noise You Can't Think Room\\". Grover wanders through \\"The Things That are Light Room\\", returns a rock to \\"The Things That are Heavy Room\\", and just when he wonders whether it is possible to have a museum that holds everything in the whole wide world, he comes upon a door labeled \\"Everything Else\\", which opens to take him out into the world. As of 1996, Publishers Weekly ranked the book at seventy-nine on their list of best-selling children's paperbacks,[2] and Lou Harry of Indianapolis Business Journal included the book on his list of twelve examples of how muppets have qualified as quality entertainment.[3] It was written by Norman Stiles and Daniel Wilcox, and illustrated by Joe Mathieu.\\r\\nThe Adventures of Grover in Outer Space is a Sesame Street storybook featuring Grover that was published in 1984.[4] When Grover Moved to Sesame Street was published in 1985.[5] He was also featured in I Want a Hat Like That (1987, reprinted 1999).[6]\\r\\nSesame Street is modified for different national markets, and Grover is often renamed.","input":"When did grover first appear on sesame street?"},{"output":"Tremont Street Subway","context":"The Tremont Street Subway in Boston's MBTA Subway system is the oldest subway tunnel in North America and the third oldest worldwide to exclusively use electric traction (after the City and South London Railway in 1890, and the Budapest Metro's Line 1 in 1896), opening on September 1, 1897.[2][3] It was originally built to get streetcar lines off the traffic-clogged streets, instead of as a true rapid transit line. It now forms the central part of the Green Line, connecting Boylston Street to Park Street and Government Center stations.\\r\\nThe tunnel originally served five closely spaced stations: Boylston, Park Street, Scollay Square, Adams Square, and Haymarket, with branches to the Public Garden Portal and Pleasant Street Incline south of Boylston. Park Street, Scollay Square, and Haymarket stations were altered over the next two decades as transfers were added to the Cambridge-Dorchester Subway, East Boston Tunnel, and Main Line Elevated (now part of the Red, Blue, and Orange Lines, respectively). In 1962, the southern portal at Pleasant Street was closed; the following year, the northern half of the tunnel was substantially altered when Government Center and a new Boston City Hall replaced Scollay Square and Adams Square. The northbound tunnel to Haymarket station was rerouted; the southbound tunnel is still original. Scollay Square station was rebuilt as Government Center, and Adams Square station was closed.[4] In 1971, the original Haymarket station was replaced with a new station just to the south.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subway in 1897 consisted of a main line under Tremont Street that terminated at Park Street, and two forks to the south. One fork has remained the extant part of the line, which veered westward along Boylston Street, toward the main-line Arlington station, as well as towards Back Bay. The other fork continued south under Tremont Street to the Pleasant Street Incline (the tunnel to which is depicted in the top right photo). This portal was used by streetcars that went southwest to Egleston via the South End, along Tremont Street (route 43), or southeast to City Point in South Boston via Broadway (route 9). Streetcar service through the southern portal ended in 1961; for the last several months, service consisted of a shuttle between the portal and Boylston station. The tunnel still exists, dead-ended at the now-buried portal, which has been converted to a public park.\\r\\nThe three original tunnel entrances were in the Boston Public Garden, at North Station/Canal Street, and at Pleasant Street. Over time, these portals were replaced and abandoned as the subway was extended. Vestiges of various closed portals are still visible inside the main Green Line's Boylston Street Subway tunnel extending west of Boylston station towards Kenmore Square station.\\r\\nThe western Public Garden portal was replaced in 1914 with two portals, one in the middle of Boylston Street adjacent to the old portal, and the other at the west end of the Boylston Street Subway, just east of Kenmore Square. The Boylston Street portal was sealed in 1941 when the Huntington Avenue Subway was opened (with a new portal at Northeastern University). The portal at Kenmore Square was replaced in 1932 when the subway was extended west beyond the Square, to the existing portals on Commonwealth Avenue (the \\"B\\" branch) and Beacon Street (the \\"C\\" branch), although the top arch of the original portal survives as part of a ventilation shaft. The Fenway portal for the \\"D\\" branch was opened in 1959.\\r\\nThe northern portal at Canal Street was replaced in 2004 when the subway was extended beneath North Station to a new portal next to Martha Road.\\r\\nThe southern portal at Pleasant Street was abandoned in 1962 following the end of streetcar service through the South End. The portal has since been sealed up and covered by Elliot Norton Park, but the dead-ended tunnel to Boylston survives underground.\\r\\nThe subway uses trolleys powered by electricity from overhead lines, which had been made possible by the invention of the trolley pole in 1880 by Frank J. Sprague,[5] from his design for the Richmond Union Passenger Railway. The line has been pantograph-only since the trolley wires were modified in the 1990s.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Tremont Street Subway was designated a National Historic Landmark in recognition for its pioneering role in the development of the subway as a public transit system in the United States. The landmark designation encompasses the still-extant portions of the early tunnel, roughly from Court Street to Charles Street, and includes the original Classical Revival head houses of the Park and Boylston stations which are still in use.[6]\\r\\nThe original owner of the Tremont Street Subway was the private West End Street Railway, later the Boston Elevated Railway. Public ownership began in 1947 with the Metropolitan Transit Authority, now the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.","input":"What is the oldest subway system in the us?"},{"output":"Princess Aurora","context":"The following are fictional characters in Disney's 1959 film Sleeping Beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincess Aurora is the title character of the film. After Maleficent curses her when she is only a baby, Aurora is taken to the woods by Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, where her name is changed to Briar Rose to conceal her identity from Maleficent. Aurora is the third official Disney Princess.\\r\\nLater in the story, the three good fairies are preparing for her birthday when they plan to surprise her with the news that she is a princess. But when Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose returns with the news of meeting a handsome and enchanting man, the fairies must tell her she can never see him again; like Aurora, they do not know who he really is. The three fairies tell her about the future that is set for her and that night they take her back to the castle. Aurora is saddened that she will never see the man from the forest and breaks into tears. The three fairies exit the room they secretly entered so as to let the princess have a few moments alone. Aurora suddenly sees a floating spark of light cast by Maleficent and, in a trance, follows the spark through the back of the fireplace and up a staircase to an abandoned empty room to a spinning wheel that was conjured up. The three good fairies try to stop her, but Aurora touches the spindle and falls to the floor, unconscious. She is put in a bed by the fairies where she can sleep peacefully within the highest tower.\\r\\nAurora was later awakened by Prince Phillip's kiss of true love, which finally broke the curse. She also learned that her love and her betrothed were exactly the same person. During the movie's final scenes, Aurora and Phillip dance.\\r\\nMaleficent is the \\"Mistress of All Evil\\" who, after not being invited to a christening, curses the infant Princess Aurora to \\"prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die\\" before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday. Merryweather was able to weaken the curse though by changing it from death into sleep.\\r\\nThe night when Aurora returned to her father's castle, the moment Aurora was alone, she seized the chance to lure her into touching a spindle of a spinning wheel. Despite the efforts of the three good fairies, she succeeded in fulfilling her curse. She then proceeded to trap Prince Phillip and lock him in her dungeon. However, the three good fairies free Phillip after she left him. Upon learning of this from her pet raven, who got turned to stone in the process by Merryweather, she tried to stop him with a series of lightning bolts, but failed. She went as far as conjuring a forest of thorns, but Phillip easily cut his way to the gate. With no other choice, she flew to the gate of King Stefan's castle and turned into a huge dragon to battle the prince herself. Despite pushing Phillip to the edge of a cliff, Phillip threw his Sword of Truth, which was blessed by the three good fairies' magic, and struck Maleficent directly in the heart, and it was more than enough to kill her. All that was left of her was a black and purple mess on the ground, with the sword still embedded in it as it blackens.\\r\\nFlora, Fauna and Merryweather are the good fairy godmothers. They are based on the good fairies appearing in the original French fairy tale and various retellings. Like their fairy tale counterparts, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather appear at baby Aurora's christening to present their gifts to the newborn Princess Aurora. Their wings are very small. They use their magical powers to help both Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip.\\r\\nPrince Phillip is Aurora's true love, voiced by Bill Shirley. Phillip is based on the prince from the original French fairy tale that appears a hundred years after the princess is put to sleep by Maleficent's curse, having heard the story of the sleeping princess, and entered the castle. He trembled upon seeing the princess's beauty and fell on his knees before her. He kissed her, then she woke up, and then everyone lived happily ever after. Unlike The Prince from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Prince Charming from Cinderella, Phillip was the first prince in Disney theatrical animated features to be given a proper name and a full character.\\r\\nAt Aurora's birth, it was said that Phillip would marry the princess, the daughter of his father's best friend. A young Phillip presents a gift to the infant Aurora at her christening, but ironically is less than impressed when he sees her. The event is interrupted by Maleficent, who appears and curses Aurora, causing the Three Good Fairies to take Aurora into the forest to raise her. Years later, Phillip is riding in the forest and hears Aurora, now known as Briar Rose, singing. He follows her voice and starts singing with her. She tries to run away, but he follows her. By the end of the song, they have fallen in love. However, Aurora realizes she is disobeying her \\"aunts\\" and leaves, but not before telling Phillip she will be celebrating her birthday at her cottage in the middle of the forest. After being captured by Maleficent and thrown into her dungeon after arriving at Briar Rose's home, the Three Good Fairies rescue him so that he in turn can save Aurora. Phillip escapes Maleficent's castle and is the target of Maleficent's fury, who hurls lightning bolts (and later conjures a forest of thorns) at him. At the gates of the castle, Phillip battles Maleficent, who has turned into a dragon. Phillip is victorious and slays Maleficent with the Sword of Truth. He kisses Aurora and she wakes up. They then go downstairs, arm in arm, and share a dance after Aurora meets her parents.\\r\\nIn Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams, Phillip is one of the characters from Sleeping Beauty to make an appearance, now voiced by Roger Craig Smith. At the beginning of the \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\" segment, Phillip is set to leave the kingdom along with his father and Aurora's parents for two days for a Royal Conference, leaving Aurora to reign over it in their absence. Before departing, Phillip encourages Aurora to do a good job while in charge of the kingdom and tells her to look at the brightest star at night, as he will be doing the same. Phillip returns at the end of the segment and is part of the celebration for Aurora's duty.\\r\\nPhillip also appears in Disney/Square's Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep in his homeworld, \\"Enchanted Dominion\\". He is voiced by Josh Robert Thompson. Phillip plays a very similar role to that of the original film, meeting Aurora at the forest and singing along with her. Later, Phillip fights along with Aqua, an original character from the video game, in the battle against Maleficent's goons, and Maleficent in her dragon form. Phillip defeats Maleficent with his sword; however, unlike the film, Maleficent is not killed, but merely weakened to the point that she reverts to her first form. Phillip goes on to kiss Aurora and break Maleficent's spell on her. In the original Kingdom Hearts, Enchanted Dominion has been swallowed by the Heartless, and Phillip himself has disappeared, but is presumably restored after Sora defeats \\"Ansem\\" at the end of the game.\\r\\nPhillip is one of the many Disney characters that appear in the TV series Disney's House of Mouse. He also appears in theme-parks and live events. Phillip is featured in the \\"Disney Heroes\\" franchise, a toyline similar but much less successful than the Disney Princess franchise. Phillip and Maleficent in dragon form appear in stylized versions, somehow different from their regular appearance.[1]\\r\\nA live-action version of Prince Phillip appeared in Disney's live-action film Maleficent, portrayed by Brenton Thwaites. In this interpretation, Phillip is sent by his father, King John of Ulstead, to King Stefan's castle on a business matter, but encounters Aurora along the way. Although they do not marry in the end, their relationship is left with the potential to become something deeper.\\r\\nKing Stefan is Aurora's father, voiced by Taylor Holmes in his last role. The film begins with a description of his kingdom and his marriage, and how happy he and his wife, Queen Leah, were with the birth of their daughter. A celebration is organized to present Aurora to the kingdom and Stefan's best friend, King Hubert, is invited. At the celebration, Aurora is betrothed to Hubert's son, Prince Phillip. The evil fairy Maleficent then makes her appearance and curses Aurora to die before her sixteenth birthday by pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel in retribution for not being invited to celebration. King Stefan decrees all spinning wheels in the kingdom burned, but Flora, Fauna and Merryweather know that this is not enough to stop Maleficent, so they ask for permission from King Stefan and his wife, the Queen Leah, to take Aurora with them and hide them until her sixteenth birthday. The narrator suggests that the following years were of sadness for Stefan and his kingdom due to Aurora's absence.\\r\\nKing Stefan next appears as the sixteen years have passed, preparing everything for the return of his daughter, and discussing with Hubert the future of their kingdoms and their children. King Stefan wishes for Aurora and Phillip to get to know each other before they get married, unlike King Hubert who already has their children's new castle made and ready for them to move in after the celebration of Aurora's return. King Stefan is next seen waiting with the whole kingdom for Aurora's arrival, unaware that she has already pricked her finger, until the fairies put everyone to sleep. King Stefan later wakes up at the end of the film, just in time to meet his daughter Aurora and watching her dancing with Prince Phillip.\\r\\nIn Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams, King Stefan, now voiced by Corey Burton, departs with Queen Leah, King Hubert and Prince Phillip to a Royal Conference, leaving her daughter Aurora in charge of the kingdom. He is next seen just as he is about to enter the castle, warned by a duke warns him to not enter the hall as it is filled with animals, a situation that is solved by Aurora just before Stefan enters the hall. He attends the celebration organized by Aurora at the end.\\r\\nIn the Disney's live-action film Maleficent, King Stefan is portrayed by Sharlto Copley. Growing up as an orphaned farm boy, Stefan became Maleficent's childhood companion, but his desire to become king resulted in him betraying Maleficent's trust; cutting her wings off to win the dying King Henry's favour. Due in part to his daughter Aurora's curse and his vindictive drive to kill Maleficent at any cost, King Stefan is shown to be extremely ruthless and paranoid in general, as opposed to the character's wise and kind personality in the original film.\\r\\nQueen Leah and her husband are the monarchs of an unnamed kingdom, in medieval Europe. After many years of marriage she gives birth to a beautiful baby daughter which she and her husband name Aurora. Her happiness is ill-fated when Maleficent, who wasn't invited, curses her daughter. Devastated, she has to see her daughter taken away by the fairies in order to protect her. Sixteen years later she is waiting the return of her daughter, but when Aurora touches the spindle, the Queen and the entire kingdom are put in a sleep by the good Fairies. When Maleficent is defeated and Aurora awakened by Phillip, she awakens, and finally meets her daughter, whom she embraces and cries tears of happiness when she sees her.\\r\\nIn the short segment, Stefan, Leah, Hubert, and Phillip all go off on a royal ceremony where Hubert is due to give a speech. Trusting their daughter, Stefan and Leah give Aurora the \\"keys to the kingdom\\" while they're away.\\r\\nIn Disney's live-action film Maleficent, Queen Leah - under the name of \\"Queen Leila\\" - was portrayed by Hannah New. She is the only daughter of the ruthless King Henry, King Stefan's predecessor. She remains loyal to her father by becoming Stefan's wife and later bearing his child. She would soon witness Maleficent, her husband's former friend whom he had betrayed, place a curse on her daughter Aurora. During the course of the film, she becomes gravelly ill and eventually dies. Stefan shows no grief over her death as he has become paranoid and obsessed with killing Maleficent.\\r\\nQueen Leah also briefly appears in the Disney Channel Original Movie Descendants. She meets Mal, daughter of Maleficent, and blames her for Maleficent's actions. She then is seen holding Chad Charming after he is knocked unconscious by Evie, the daughter of the Evil Queen.\\r\\nKing Hubert is Phillip's father, voiced by Bill Thompson. King Hubert and his best friend, King Stefan, had betrothed their children to marry each other when the time comes, so that their kingdoms remain forever united. He is invited to Aurora's christening and witnesses Maleficent cursing Aurora. Though the baby princess Aurora is taken away by Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, the betrothal remains the same. Hubert is next seen as sixteen years have passed and Stefan is preparing the celebration for Aurora's return. King Hubert and King Stefan are talking about their children and their kingdoms when the conversation almost results in a fight until both kings realize they are about to fight for no reason. The scene is interrupted by Phillip's arrival. Prince Phillip tells his father that he has met a young woman in the forest and that he will marry her, against his father's will. Unbeknownst to Hubert, this young woman is Aurora under the disguise of \\"Briar Rose\\", the fake identity the fairies have given her to protect her from Maleficent. King Hubert is enraged at his son for even entertaining the notion of marrying a peasant girl, but Phillip, somewhat humorously says to his father royalty must start considering new ideas, for \\"it is the 14th Century, after all\\". Dismayed at failing to dissuade his son from his expected betrothal, Hubert proceeds to tell King Stefan the bad news. During these events, Maleficent's curse has been fulfilled and Aurora has fallen into a deep sleep, so the fairies decide to put everyone else asleep. Just as he is falling asleep, King Hubert is telling an already sleeping King Stefan that Phillip is in love with a peasant girl, which makes Flora realize that it was Phillip whom Aurora met in the forest. King Hubert wakes up at the end of the film, resuming his conversation with King Stefan and is about to tell him that Phillip loves a peasant girl when Aurora and Phillip are seen coming down the hall staircase, which leaves Hubert confused but satisfied.\\r\\nKing Hubert is one of the characters from Sleeping Beauty that return in Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams, now voiced by Jeff Bennett. He attends a Royal Conference along with Prince Phillip, King Stefan and Queen Leah, in which King Hubert is due to give a speech. However, King Hubert realizes he has forgotten his speech at King Stefan's castle only when he is already at the Royal Conference. King Hubert tries to find it everywhere until the fairies arrive and deliver him his speech. Hubert is next seen at the end of the film, attending a meal organized by Aurora.\\r\\nDiablo is Maleficent's pet raven. The source of his name is not clear as he is never named in the film. Diablo is present at Aurora's christening, during which Maleficent curses the baby. When Maleficent's goons inform their mistress that they have spent sixteen years searching for a baby, she sends Diablo to look for Aurora. Diablo flies over the forest looking for any sign of the princess until he discovers the cottage where she is living with the fairies due to some magic caused by Flora and Merryweather. After informing his mistress, Diablo joins Maleficent as she and the goons capture Phillip in the cottage, and notices the fairies' presence in the Forbidden Mountain while Maleficent is unaware of it. Diablo later discovers that Phillip has escaped with the fairies' aid, and commands the goons to stop them from leaving the mountain. Merryweather returns and chases Diablo round Maleficent's tower until she turns him into a stone raven, but the raven was able to attract attention to Maleficent who learned about his fate and the escaping Prince Phillip. He was voiced by Dal McKennon in the original film and is currently voiced by Sam Riley.\\r\\nDiablo plays small but vital roles in the Kingdom Hearts series: First in Kingdom Hearts II where he carried Maleficent's cloak into Yen Sid's tower to ensure her revival, and then Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance to deliver a message to Mickey.\\r\\nPortrayed by Sam Riley in the live-action film Maleficent, Diaval is introduced as a raven whom Maleficent saved to be her servant. Throughout the film, Maleficent and Diaval's relationship develops from that of a servant and mistress and blossoms into a deep friendship (the novelization hints that he is in love with her). Using her magic, Diaval can be turned into a human or any other animal Maleficent wishes, for example mostly a man, raven but also, wolf, horse, and dragon.\\r\\nSamson is Prince Phillip's pet horse. He appears in the two films. He is very fond of Aurora, but can become jealous when Phillip shows affection towards her. He is voiced by Frank Welker in Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams.\\r\\nMaleficent's army is made up of goblin-type creatures that resemble boars, hawks, alligators, goats, bats, vultures, and other creatures. Though loyal, the goons have low intelligence as, due to unclear orders from Maleficent who is infuriated with their stupidity, they spent 16 years searching for an infant Aurora rather than a girl of proper age. The goons later appear to capture Prince Phillip in the cottage where the three fairies were hiding Aurora, and again attempting to thwart his escape by pushing boulders (Flora turns them into bubbles), shooting arrows (Flora turns them into flowers), and pouring boiling oil (Flora turns it into a rainbow).\\r\\nThe goons make cameo appearances in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep.","input":"Who is the main character in sleeping beauty?"},{"output":"isolationist","context":"The Edo period (??ry, Edo jidai) or Tokugawa period (?ܤ?ry) is the period between 1603 and 1868 in the history of Japan, when Japanese society was under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate and the country's 300 regional daimy. The period was characterized by economic growth, strict social order, isolationist foreign policies, a stable population, \\"no more wars\\", and popular enjoyment of arts and culture. The shogunate was officially established in Edo on March 24, 1603, by Tokugawa Ieyasu. The period came to an end with the Meiji Restoration on May 3, 1868, after the fall of Edo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA revolution took place from the time of the Kamakura shogunate, which existed with the Tenn's court, to the Tokugawa, when the samurai became the unchallenged rulers in what historian Edwin O. Reischauer called a \\"centralized feudal\\" form of shogunate. Instrumental in the rise of the new-existing bakufu was Tokugawa Ieyasu, the main beneficiary of the achievements of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Already powerful, Ieyasu profited by his transfer to the rich Kant area. He maintained two million koku of land, a new headquarters at Edo, a strategically situated castle town (the future Tokyo), and also had an additional two million koku of land and thirty-eight vassals under his control. After Hideyoshi's death, Ieyasu moved quickly to seize control from the Toyotomi clan.\\r\\nIeyasu's victory over the western daimy at the Battle of Sekigahara (October 21, 1600, or in the Japanese calendar on the 15th day of the ninth month of the fifth year of the Keich era) gave him control of all Japan. He rapidly abolished numerous enemy daimy houses, reduced others, such as that of the Toyotomi, and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies. Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western daimy, but his assumption of the title of shgun helped consolidate the alliance system. After further strengthening his power base, Ieyasu installed his son Hidetada (1579ÿ1632) as shgun and himself as retired shgun in 1605. The Toyotomi were still a significant threat, and Ieyasu devoted the next decade to their eradication. In 1615, the Tokugawa army destroyed the Toyotomi stronghold at Osaka.\\r\\nThe Tokugawa (or Edo) period brought 250 years of stability to Japan. The political system evolved into what historians call bakuhan, a combination of the terms bakufu and han (domains) to describe the government and society of the period.[1] In the bakuhan, the shgun had national authority and the daimy had regional authority. This represented a new unity in the feudal structure, which featured an increasingly large bureaucracy to administer the mixture of centralized and decentralized authorities. The Tokugawa became more powerful during their first century of rule: land redistribution gave them nearly seven million koku, control of the most important cities, and a land assessment system reaping great revenues.\\r\\nThe feudal hierarchy was completed by the various classes of daimy. Closest to the Tokugawa house were the shinpan, or \\"related houses\\". They were twenty-three daimy on the borders of Tokugawa lands, all directly related to Ieyasu. The shinpan held mostly honorary titles and advisory posts in the bakufu. The second class of the hierarchy were the fudai, or \\"house daimy\\", rewarded with lands close to the Tokugawa holdings for their faithful service. By the 18th century, 145 fudai controlled such smaller han, the greatest assessed at 250,000 koku. Members of the fudai class staffed most of the major bakufu offices. Ninety-seven han formed the third group, the tozama (outside vassals), former opponents or new allies. The tozama were located mostly on the peripheries of the archipelago and collectively controlled nearly ten million koku of productive land. Because the tozama were least trusted of the daimy, they were the most cautiously managed and generously treated, although they were excluded from central government positions.\\r\\nThe Tokugawa shogunate not only consolidated their control over a reunified Japan, they also had unprecedented power over the emperor, the court, all daimy and the religious orders. The emperor was held up as the ultimate source of political sanction for the shgun, who ostensibly was the vassal of the imperial family. The Tokugawa helped the imperial family recapture its old glory by rebuilding its palaces and granting it new lands. To ensure a close tie between the imperial clan and the Tokugawa family, Ieyasu's granddaughter was made an imperial consort in 1619.\\r\\nA code of laws was established to regulate the daimy houses. The code encompassed private conduct, marriage, dress, types of weapons and numbers of troops allowed; required feudal lords to reside in Edo every other year (the sankin-ktai system); prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships; proscribed Christianity; restricted castles to one per domain (han) and stipulated that bakufu regulations were the national law. Although the daimy were not taxed per se, they were regularly levied for contributions for military and logistical support and for such public works projects as castles, roads, bridges and palaces. The various regulations and levies not only strengthened the Tokugawa but also depleted the wealth of the daimy, thus weakening their threat to the central administration. The han, once military-centered domains, became mere local administrative units. The daimy did have full administrative control over their territory and their complex systems of retainers, bureaucrats and commoners. Loyalty was exacted from religious foundations, already greatly weakened by Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, through a variety of control mechanisms.\\r\\nLike Hideyoshi, Ieyasu encouraged foreign trade but also was suspicious of outsiders. He wanted to make Edo a major port, but once he learned that the Europeans favored ports in Kysh and that China had rejected his plans for official trade, he moved to control existing trade and allowed only certain ports to handle specific kinds of commodities.\\r\\nThe beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the Nanban trade period during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built its first ocean-going Western-style warships, such as the San Juan Bautista, a 500-ton galleon-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by Hasekura Tsunenaga to the Americas and then to Europe. Also during that period, the bakufu commissioned around 720 Red Seal Ships, three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as Yamada Nagamasa, used those ships throughout Asia.\\r\\nThe \\"Christian problem\\" was, in effect, a problem of controlling both the Christian daimy in Kysh and their trade with the Europeans. By 1612, the shgun's retainers and residents of Tokugawa lands had been ordered to forswear Christianity. More restrictions came in 1616 (the restriction of foreign trade to Nagasaki and Hirado, an island northwest of Kysh), 1622 (the execution of 120 missionaries and converts), 1624 (the expulsion of the Spanish), and 1629 (the execution of thousands of Christians). Finally, the Closed Country Edict of 1635 prohibited any Japanese from traveling outside Japan or, if someone left, from ever returning. In 1636 the Dutch were restricted to Dejima, a small artificial islandand thus, not true Japanese soilin Nagasaki's harbor.\\r\\nThe shogunate perceived Catholic Christianity to be an extremely destabilizing factor, and so decided to persecute it. The Shimabara Rebellion of 1637ÿ38, in which discontented Catholic Christian samurai and peasants rebelled against the bakufuand Edo called in Dutch ships to bombard the rebel strongholdmarked the end of the Christian movement, although some Catholic Christians survived by going underground, the so-called Kakure Kirishitan. Soon thereafter, the Portuguese were permanently expelled, members of the Portuguese diplomatic mission were executed, all subjects were ordered to register at a Buddhist or Shinto temple, and the Dutch and Chinese were restricted, respectively, to Dejima and to a special quarter in Nagasaki. Besides small trade of some outer daimy with Korea and the Ryukyu Islands, to the southwest of Japan's main islands, by 1641, foreign contacts were limited by the policy of sakoku to Nagasaki.\\r\\nThe last Jesuit was either killed or reconverted by 1644[2] and by the 1660s, Christianity was almost completely eradicated, and its external political, economic, and religious influence on Japan became quite limited.[3] Only China, the Dutch East India Company, and for a short period, the English, enjoyed the right to visit Japan during this period, for commercial purposes only, and they were restricted to the Dejima port in Nagasaki. Other Europeans who landed on Japanese shores were put to death without trial.\\r\\nEdo society had an elaborate social structure, in which everyone knew their place and level of prestige. At the top were the Emperor and the court nobility, invincible in prestige but weak in power. Next came the shgun, daimy and layers of feudal lords whose rank was indicated by their closeness to the Tokugawa. They had power. The daimy comprised about 250 local lords of local \\"han\\" with annual outputs of 50,000 or more bushels of rice. The upper strata was much given to elaborate and expensive rituals, including elegant architecture, landscaped gardens, Noh drama, patronage of the arts, and the tea ceremony.[4]\\r\\nAfter a long period of inner conflict, the first goal of the newly established Tokugawa government was to pacify the country. It created a balance of power that remained (fairly) stable for the next 250 years, influenced by Confucian principles of social order. Most samurai lost their direct possession of the land: the daimy took over their land. The samurai had a choice: give up their sword and become peasants, or move to the city of their feudal lord and become a paid retainer. Only a few land samurai remained in the border provinces of the north, or as direct vassals of the shgun, the 5,000 so-called hatamoto. The daimy were put under tight control of the shogunate. Their families had to reside in Edo; the daimy themselves had to reside in Edo for one year and in their province (han) for the next. This system was called sankin-ktai.\\r\\nThe individual had no legal rights in Tokugawa Japan. The family was the smallest legal entity, and the maintenance of family status and privileges was of great importance at all levels of society. The 1711 Gotke reij was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.[5]\\r\\nDuring the Tokugawa period, the social order, based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the emperor and court nobles (kuge), together with the shgun and daimy. Below them the population was divided into four classes in a system known as mibunsei (㶇): the samurai on top (about 5% of the population) and the peasants (more than 80% of the population) on the second level. Below the peasants were the craftsmen, and even below them, on the fourth level, were the merchants.[6] Only the peasants lived in the rural areas. Samurai, craftsmen and merchants lived in the cities that were built around daimy castles, each restricted to their own quarter.\\r\\nOutside the four classes were the so-called eta and hinin, those whose professions broke the taboos of Buddhism. Eta were butchers, tanners and undertakers. Hinin served as town guards, street cleaners, and executioners. Other outsiders included the beggars, entertainers, and prostitutes. The word eta literally translates to \\"filthy\\" and hinin to \\"non-humans\\", a thorough reflection of the attitude held by other classes that the eta and hinin were not even people.[7] Hinin were only allowed inside a special quarter of the city. Other persecution of the hinin included disallowing them from wearing robes longer than knee-length and the wearing of hats.[7] Sometimes eta villages were not even printed on official maps. A sub-class of hinin who were born into their social class had no option of mobility to a different social class whereas the other class of hinin who had lost their previous class status could be reinstated in Japanese society.[7] In the 19th century the umbrella term burakumin was coined to name the eta and hinin because both classes were forced to live in separate village neighborhoods.[8] The eta, hinin and burakumin classes were officially abolished in 1871.[7] However, their cultural and societal impact, including some forms of discrimination, continued into modern times.[8]\\r\\nThe Edo period bequeathed a vital commercial sector to be in burgeoning urban centers, a relatively well-educated elite, a sophisticated government bureaucracy, productive agriculture, a closely unified nation with highly developed financial and marketing systems, and a national infrastructure of roads.\\r\\nEconomic development during the Tokugawa period included urbanization, increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign commerce, and a diffusion of trade and handicraft industries. The construction trades flourished, along with banking facilities and merchant associations. Increasingly, han authorities oversaw the rising agricultural production and the spread of rural handicrafts.\\r\\nBy the mid-18th century, Edo had a population of more than one million, and Osaka and Kyoto each had more than 400,000 inhabitants. Many other castle towns grew as well. Japan had almost zero population growth between the 1720s and 1820s, often attributed to lower birth rates in response to widespread famine, but some historians have presented different theories, such as a high rate of infanticide artificially controlling population.[9] Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.\\r\\nRice was the base of the economy. About 80% of the people were rice farmers.[10] Rice production increased steadily, but population remained stable, so prosperity increased. Rice paddies grew from 1.6 million ch in 1600 to 3 million by 1720.[11] Improved technology helped farmers control the all-important flow of irrigation to their paddies. The daimy operated several hundred castle towns, which became loci of domestic trade. Large-scale rice markets developed, centered on Edo and saka.[12] In the cities and towns, guilds of merchants and artisans met the growing demand for goods and services. The merchants, while low in status, prospered, especially those with official patronage. Merchants invented credit instruments to transfer money, currency came into common use, and the strengthening credit market encouraged entrepreneurship.[13] The daimy collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice. Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the fudasashi market in Edo. To raise money, the daimy used forward contracts to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern futures trading.\\r\\nIt was during the Edo period that Japan developed an advanced forest management policy. Increased demand for timber resources for construction, shipbuilding and fuel had led to widespread deforestation, which resulted in forest fires, floods and soil erosion. In response the shgun, beginning around 1666, instituted a policy to reduce logging and increase the planting of trees. The policy mandated that only the shgun and daimy could authorize the use of wood. By the 18th century, Japan had developed detailed scientific knowledge about silviculture and plantation forestry.[14]\\r\\nDuring the period, Japan studied Western sciences and techniques (called rangaku, \\"Dutch studies\\") through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in Dejima. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or wadokei, inspired by Western techniques.\\r\\nThe flourishing of Neo-Confucianism was the major intellectual development of the Tokugawa period. Confucian studies had long been kept active in Japan by Buddhist clerics, but during the Tokugawa period, Confucianism emerged from Buddhist religious control. This system of thought increased attention to a secular view of man and society. The ethical humanism, rationalism, and historical perspective of neo-Confucian doctrine appealed to the official class. By the mid-17th century, neo-Confucianism was Japan's dominant legal philosophy and contributed directly to the development of the kokugaku (national learning) school of thought.\\r\\nAdvanced studies and growing applications of neo-Confucianism contributed to the transition of the social and political order from feudal norms to class- and large-group-oriented practices. The rule of the people or Confucian man was gradually replaced by the rule of law. New laws were developed, and new administrative devices were instituted. A new theory of government and a new vision of society emerged as a means of justifying more comprehensive governance by the bakufu. Each person had a distinct place in society and was expected to work to fulfill his or her mission in life. The people were to be ruled with benevolence by those whose assigned duty it was to rule. Government was all-powerful but responsible and humane. Although the class system was influenced by neo-Confucianism, it was not identical to it. Whereas soldiers and clergy were at the bottom of the hierarchy in the Chinese model, in Japan, some members of these classes constituted the ruling elite.\\r\\nMembers of the samurai class adhered to bushi traditions with a renewed interest in Japanese history and in cultivation of the ways of Confucian scholar-administrators. Another special way of lifechnindalso emerged. Chnind (\\"the way of the townspeople\\") was a distinct culture that arose in cities such as Osaka, Kyoto, and Edo. It encouraged aspiration to bushido qualitiesdiligence, honesty, honor, loyalty, and frugalitywhile blending Shinto, neo-Confucian, and Buddhist beliefs. Study of mathematics, astronomy, cartography, engineering, and medicine were also encouraged. Emphasis was placed on quality of workmanship, especially in the arts.\\r\\nFor the first time, urban populations had the means and leisure time to support a new mass culture. Their search for enjoyment became known as ukiyo (the floating world), an ideal world of fashion, popular entertainment, and the discovery of aesthetic qualities in objects and actions of everyday life. This increasing interest in pursuing recreational activities helped to develop an array of new industries, many of which could be found in an area known as Yoshiwara. The region was better known for being the center of Edos developing sense of elegance and refinement. This place of pleasure and luxury became a destination for the elite and wealthy merchants who wished to flaunt their fortune.[15] Their economy relied primarily on the patronage of such individuals in order to sustain itself. For many of those who inhabited and worked in this region maintaining the illusion of grandeur was the only way of supporting their business.\\r\\nYoshiwara was home to mostly women who, due to unfortunate circumstances, found themselves working in this secluded environment. Combining factors such as rent, value of their employment contract, cost of clothing, make-up, gift giving, and other expenses ensured that many would spend their entire lives working to pay off their debts. These females were expected to perform dances, sing, play an instrument, gossip or provide companionship so that their guests would come again. As a result, the region developed its own culture which, in turn, determined what would be popular in the rest of the country. This was particularly true for fashion because a woman's identity was determined by her clothing, specifically it clarified what her profession and status was within that field. The quality of her attire ensured that she stood out from the rest of her competition. It was her only means of establishing a reputation and helped to market her talents. However, Yoshiwara also possessed a seedier side. Much of the business conducted here incorporated the use of prostitution as a means to deal with the women's cost of living. As a result, since its establishment was first authorised by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1589,[16] this area became the country's government sanctioned red-light district. This designation lasted for about 250 years.\\r\\nProfessional female entertainers (geisha), music, popular stories, Kabuki and bunraku (puppet theater), poetry, a rich literature, and art, exemplified by beautiful woodblock prints (known as ukiyo-e), were all part of this flowering of culture. Literature also flourished with the talented examples of the playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653ÿ1724) and the poet, essayist, and travel writer Matsuo Bash (1644ÿ94).\\r\\nMatsumura Keibun is one of the most significant painters of this period. His works commonly included realistic depictions of birds, flowers and animals.[17]\\r\\nUkiyo-e is a genre of painting and printmaking that developed in the late 17th century, at first depicting the entertainments of the pleasure districts of Edo, such as courtesans and kabuki actors. Harunobu produced the first full-colour nishiki-e prints in 1765, a form that has become synonymous to most with ukiyo-e. The genre reached a peak in technique towards the end of the century with the works of such artists as Kiyonaga and Utamaro. As the Edo period came to an end a great diversity of genres proliferated: warriors, nature, folklore, and the landscapes of Hokusai and Hiroshige. The genre declined throughout the rest of the century in the face of modernization that saw ukiyo-e as both old-fashioned and laborious to produce compared to Western technologies. Ukiyo-e was a primary part of the wave of Japonism that swept Western art in the late 19th century.\\r\\nBuddhism and Shinto were both still important in Tokugawa Japan. Buddhism, together with neo-Confucianism, provided standards of social behavior. Although Buddhism was not as politically powerful as it had been in the past, Buddhism continued to be espoused by the upper classes. Proscriptions against Christianity benefited Buddhism in 1640 when the bakufu ordered everyone to register at a temple. The rigid separation of Tokugawa society into han, villages, wards, and households helped reaffirm local Shinto attachments. Shinto provided spiritual support to the political order and was an important tie between the individual and the community. Shinto also helped preserve a sense of national identity.\\r\\nShinto eventually assumed an intellectual form as shaped by neo-Confucian rationalism and materialism. The kokugaku movement emerged from the interactions of these two belief systems. Kokugaku contributed to the emperor-centered nationalism of modern Japan and the revival of Shinto as a national creed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Kojiki, Nihon Shoki, and Man'ysh were all studied anew in the search for the Japanese spirit. Some purists in the kokugaku movement, such as Motoori Norinaga, even criticized the Confucian and Buddhist influencesin effect, foreign influencesfor contaminating Japan's ancient ways. Japan was the land of the kami and, as such, had a special destiny.[18]\\r\\nThe Edo period was characterized by an unprecedented series of economic developments (despite termination of contact with the outside world) and cultural maturation, especially in terms of theater, music, and other entertainment. For example, a poetic meter for music called kinsei kouta-ch was invented during this time[19] and is still used today in folk songs. Music and theater were influenced by the social gap between the noble and commoner classes, and different arts became more defined as this gap widened. Several different types of kabuki (theater) emerged. Some, such as shibaraku, were only available at a certain time of year, while some companies only performed for nobles. Fashion trends, satirization of local news stories, and advertisements were often part of kabuki theater, as well.[20]\\r\\nThe end of this period is specifically called the late Tokugawa shogunate. The cause for the end of this period is controversial but is recounted as the forcing of Japan's opening to the world by Commodore Matthew Perry of the US Navy, whose armada (known by Japanese as \\"the black ships\\") fired weapons from Edo Bay. Several artificial land masses were created to block the range of the armada, and this land remains in what is presently called the Odaiba district.\\r\\nThe Tokugawa did not eventually collapse simply because of intrinsic failures. Foreign intrusions helped to precipitate a complex political struggle between the bakufu and a coalition of its critics. The continuity of the anti-bakufu movement in the mid-19th century would finally bring down the Tokugawa. Historians consider that a major contributing factor to the decline of the Tokugawa was \\"poor management of the central government by the shgun, which caused the social classes in Japan to fall apart\\".[attribution needed][21] From the outset, the Tokugawa attempted to restrict families' accumulation of wealth and fostered a \\"back to the soil\\" policy, in which the farmer, the ultimate producer, was the ideal person in society.\\r\\nDespite these efforts to restrict wealth and partly because of the extraordinary period of peace, the standard of living for urban and rural dwellers alike grew significantly during the Tokugawa period. Better means of crop production, transport, housing, food, and entertainment were all available, as was more leisure time, at least for urban dwellers. The literacy rate was high for a preindustrial society (by some estimates the literacy rate in the city of Edo was 80 percent), and cultural values were redefined and widely imparted throughout the samurai and chnin classes. Despite the reappearance of guilds, economic activities went well beyond the restrictive nature of the guilds, and commerce spread and a money economy developed. Although government heavily restricted the merchants and viewed them as unproductive and usurious members of society, the samurai, who gradually became separated from their rural ties, depended greatly on the merchants and artisans for consumer goods, artistic interests, and loans. In this way, a subtle subversion of the warrior class by the chnin took place.\\r\\nA struggle arose in the face of political limitations that the shgun imposed on the entrepreneurial class. The government ideal of an agrarian society failed to square with the reality of commercial distribution. A huge government bureaucracy had evolved, which now stagnated because of its discrepancy with a new and evolving social order. Compounding the situation, the population increased significantly during the first half of the Tokugawa period. Although the magnitude and growth rates are uncertain, there were at least 26 million commoners and about four million members of samurai families and their attendants when the first nationwide census was taken in 1721. Drought, followed by crop shortages and starvation, resulted in twenty great famines between 1675 and 1837. During the Tokugawa period, there were 154 famines, of which 21 were widespread and serious.[22] Peasant unrest grew, and by the late 18th century, mass protests over taxes and food shortages had become commonplace. Newly landless families became tenant farmers, while the displaced rural poor moved into the cities. As the fortunes of previously well-to-do families declined, others moved in to accumulate land, and a new, wealthy farming class emerged. Those people who benefited were able to diversify production and to hire laborers, while others were left discontented. Many samurai fell on hard times and were forced into handicraft production and wage jobs for merchants.\\r\\nAlthough Japan was able to acquire and refine a wide variety of scientific knowledge, the rapid industrialization of the West during the 18th century created a material gap in terms of technologies and armament between Japan and the West, forcing it to abandon its policy of seclusion and contributing to the end of the Tokugawa regime.\\r\\nWestern intrusions were on the increase in the early 19th century. Russian warships and traders encroached on Karafuto (called Sakhalin under Russian and Soviet control) and on the Kuril Islands, the southernmost of which are considered by the Japanese as the northern islands of Hokkaid. A British warship entered Nagasaki harbour searching for enemy Dutch ships in 1808, and other warships and whalers were seen in Japanese waters with increasing frequency in the 1810s and 1820s. Whalers and trading ships from the United States also arrived on Japan's shores. Although the Japanese made some minor concessions and allowed some landings, they largely attempted to keep all foreigners out, sometimes using force. Rangaku became crucial not only in understanding the foreign \\"barbarians\\" but also in using the knowledge gained from the West to fend them off.\\r\\nBy the 1830s, there was a general sense of crisis. Famines and natural disasters hit hard, and unrest led to a peasant uprising against officials and merchants in Osaka in 1837. Although it lasted only a day, the uprising made a dramatic impression. Remedies came in the form of traditional solutions that sought to reform moral decay rather than address institutional problems. The shgun's advisers pushed for a return to the martial spirit, more restrictions on foreign trade and contacts, suppression of rangaku, censorship of literature, and elimination of \\"luxury\\" in the government and samurai class. Others sought the overthrow of the Tokugawa and espoused the political doctrine of sonn ji (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians), which called for unity under imperial rule and opposed foreign intrusions. The bakufu persevered for the time being amidst growing concerns over Western successes in establishing colonial enclaves in China following the First Opium War of 1839ÿ1842. More reforms were ordered, especially in the economic sector, to strengthen Japan against the Western threat.\\r\\nJapan turned down a demand from the United States, which was greatly expanding its own presence in the Asia-Pacific region, to establish diplomatic relations when Commodore James Biddle appeared in Edo Bay with two warships in July 1846.\\r\\nWhen Commodore Matthew C. Perry's four-ship squadron appeared in Edo Bay in July 1853, the bakufu was thrown into turmoil. The chairman of the senior councillors, Abe Masahiro (1819ÿ1857), was responsible for dealing with the Americans. Having no precedent to manage this threat to national security, Abe tried to balance the desires of the senior councillors to compromise with the foreigners, of the emperor who wanted to keep the foreigners out, and of the daimy who wanted to go to war. Lacking consensus, Abe decided to compromise by accepting Perry's demands for opening Japan to foreign trade while also making military preparations. In March 1854, the Treaty of Peace and Amity (or Treaty of Kanagawa) opened two ports to American ships seeking provisions, guaranteed good treatment to shipwrecked American sailors, and allowed a United States consul to take up residence in Shimoda, a seaport on the Izu Peninsula, southwest of Edo. The Treaty of Amity and Commerce Between the U.S. and Japan (Harris Treaty), opening still more areas to American trade, was forced on the bakufu five years later.\\r\\nThe resulting damage to the bakufu was significant. The devalued price for gold in Japan was one immediate, enormous effect.[23] The European and American traders purchased gold for its original price on the world market and then sold it to the Chinese for triple the price.[23] Along with this, cheap goods from these developed nations, like finished cotton, flooded the market forcing many Japanese out of business.[23] Debate over government policy was unusual and had engendered public criticism of the bakufu. In the hope of enlisting the support of new allies, Abe, to the consternation of the fudai, had consulted with the shinpan and tozama daimy, further undermining the already weakened bakufu. In the Ansei Reform (1854ÿ1856), Abe then tried to strengthen the regime by ordering Dutch warships and armaments from the Netherlands and building new port defenses. In 1855, a naval training school with Dutch instructors was set up at Nagasaki, and a Western-style military school was established at Edo; by the next year, the government was translating Western books. Opposition to Abe increased within fudai circles, which opposed opening bakufu councils to tozama daimy, and he was replaced in 1855 as chairman of the senior councilors by Hotta Masayoshi (1810ÿ1864).\\r\\nAt the head of the dissident faction was Tokugawa Nariaki, who had long embraced a militant loyalty to the emperor along with anti-foreign sentiments, and who had been put in charge of national defense in 1854. The Mito schoolbased on neo-Confucian and Shinto principleshad as its goal the restoration of the imperial institution, the turning back of the West, and the founding of a world empire under the divine Yamato dynasty.\\r\\nIn the final years of the Tokugawas, foreign contacts increased as more concessions were granted. The new treaty with the United States in 1859 allowed more ports to be opened to diplomatic representatives, unsupervised trade at four additional ports, and foreign residences in Osaka and Edo. It also embodied the concept of extraterritoriality (foreigners were subject to the laws of their own countries but not to Japanese law). Hotta lost the support of key daimy, and when Tokugawa Nariaki opposed the new treaty, Hotta sought imperial sanction. The court officials, perceiving the weakness of the bakufu, rejected Hotta's request and thus suddenly embroiled Kyoto and the emperor in Japan's internal politics for the first time in many centuries. When the shgun died without an heir, Nariaki appealed to the court for support of his own son, Tokugawa Yoshinobu (or Keiki), for shgun, a candidate favored by the shinpan and tozama daimy. The fudai won the power struggle, however, installing Tokugawa Yoshitomi, arresting Nariaki and Keiki, executing Yoshida Shin (1830ÿ1859), a leading sonn-ji intellectual who had opposed the American treaty and plotted a revolution against the bakufu), and signing treaties with the United States and five other nations, thus ending more than 200 years of exclusion.\\r\\nRecently[when?] some scholars[who?] have suggested that there were more events that spurred this opening of Japan. From 1716 to 1745 Yoshimune (eighth Tokugawa shgun from 1716ÿ1745) started the first Kyh reforms in an attempt to gain more revenue for the government.[24] In 1767 to 1786 Tanuma Okitsugu also initiated some unorthodox economic reforms to expand government income.[24] This led his conservative opponents to attack him and take his position as he was forced from government in disgrace.[24] Similarly, Matsudaira Sadanobu launched the Kansei Reforms in 1787ÿ1793 to stabilize rice prices, cut government costs, and increase revenues.[24] The final economic reform of the Tenp era of 1841ÿ1843 had similar objectives. Most were ineffective and only worked in some areas. These economic failings would also have been a force in the opening of Japan, as Japanese businessmen desired larger markets. Some scholars also point to internal activism for political change. The Mito school had long been an active force in demanding political changes, such as restoring the powers of the Emperor. This anger can also be seen in the poetry of Matsuo Taseko (a woman who farmed silk worms in the Ina Valley) from Hirata Atsutane's School of National Learning:\\r\\n\\"It is disgusting\\r\\nthe agitation over thread\\r\\nIn today's world\\r\\nEver since the ships\\r\\nfrom foreign countries\\r\\ncame for the jeweled\\r\\nsilkworm cocoons\\r\\nto the land of the gods and the Emperor\\r\\nPeoples hearts\\r\\nawesome though they are,\\r\\nare being pulled apart\\r\\nand consumed by rage.\\"\\r\\n[25] This inspired many anti-Tokugawa activists as they blamed the Bakufu for impoverishing the people and dishonoring the emperor.[25]\\r\\nDuring the last years of the bakufu, or bakumatsu, the bakufu took strong measures to try to reassert its dominance, although its involvement with modernization and foreign powers was to make it a target of anti-Western sentiment throughout the country.\\r\\nThe army and the navy were modernized. A naval training school was established in Nagasaki in 1855. Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders, such as Admiral Enomoto. French naval engineers were hired to build naval arsenals, such as Yokosuka and Nagasaki. By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867, the Japanese navy of the shgun already possessed eight Western-style steam warships around the flagship Kaiy Maru, which were used against pro-imperial forces during the Boshin War under the command of Admiral Enomoto. A French military mission was established to help modernize the armies of the bakufu.\\r\\nRevering the emperor as a symbol of unity, extremists wrought violence and death against the Bakufu and Han authorities and foreigners. Foreign naval retaliation in the Anglo-Satsuma War led to still another concessionary commercial treaty in 1865, but Yoshitomi was unable to enforce the Western treaties. A bakufu army was defeated when it was sent to crush dissent in the Satsuma and Chsh Domains in 1866. Finally, in 1867, Emperor Kmei died and was succeeded by his underaged son Emperor Meiji.\\r\\nTokugawa Yoshinobu reluctantly became head of the Tokugawa house and shgun. He tried to reorganize the government under the emperor while preserving the shgun's leadership role. Fearing the growing power of the Satsuma and Chsh daimy, other daimy called for returning the shgun's political power to the emperor and a council of daimy chaired by the former Tokugawa shgun. Yoshinobu accepted the plan in late 1867 and resigned, announcing an \\"imperial restoration\\". The Satsuma, Chsh, and other han leaders and radical courtiers, however, rebelled, seized the imperial palace, and announced their own restoration on January 3, 1868.\\r\\nFollowing the Boshin War (1868ÿ1869), the bakufu was abolished, and Yoshinobu was reduced to the ranks of the common daimy. Resistance continued in the North throughout 1868, and the bakufu naval forces under Admiral Enomoto Takeaki continued to hold out for another six months in Hokkaid, where they founded the short-lived Republic of Ezo.\\r\\nThe Edo period is the setting of many works of popular culture. These include novels, comics, stageplays, films, television shows, animated works, and manga.\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the Library of Congress Country Studies website http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/.

It was formed on July 10, 1997, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and is currently headquartered in Santa Monica, California.[5][6]\\r\\nIn addition to its flagship Lionsgate Films division, which generated the seventh-highest gross revenue in North America in 2015, the company contains other divisions such as Lionsgate Television and Lionsgate Interactive.[7] It owns a variety of subsidiaries such as Summit Entertainment, Debmar-Mercury, and Starz Inc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLions Gate Entertainment Corp. (Lionsgate) was formed in 1997 by Frank Giustra and Avi Federgreen with a $16 million investment including another $40 million from other investors which included Keyur Patel and Yorkton Securities' executives such as G. Scott Paterson.[8] Giustra had recently retired as CEO from Yorkton, an investment bank, and Paterson was then president. Giustra then merged Lionsgate with Toronto Stock Exchange listed Beringer Gold Corp. (founded in 1986) to take the company public. Beringer's mining assets were soon sold off.[6][9][10]\\r\\nLionsgate then began a series of acquisitions to get into the film industry. The company bought a number of small production facilities and distributors, starting with Montreal-based Cinpix Film Properties (renamed as Lions Gate Films) and North Shore Studios (renamed Lions Gate Studios) in Vancouver, British Columbia. Mandalay Television was acquired by Lionsgate from Peter Guber for a 4% Lionsgate stake. In 1998, Lionsgate helped Guber form Mandalay Pictures with a 45% investment in Mandalay. Lionsgate followed that up with a June purchase of International Movie Group, Inc. (IMG), a bankrupt film distributor previously invested in by Guber and Yorktown Securities, for its film library. IMG's CEO Peter Strauss became President of Lions Gate Entertainment, Inc. (LGE), the American parent company for Lionsgate's U.S. interests.[9] The Lions Gate Media subsidiary was also formed to produce for television.[9]\\r\\nCompleting its first year of operation, Lionsgate had revenue of $42.2 million with loss of $397,000. The company share price dropped to a low of $1.40. This limited the corporation's ability to make acquisitions via stock swaps. Lionsgate instead made its next acquisition of Termite Art Productions, a reality-based television production company, for $2.75 million by issuing three convertible promissory notes. Giustra had the shareholders vote to move the company's public listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to the American Stock Exchange, along with a two-for-one stock consolidation to qualify, for greater exposure that might boost share value.[9]\\r\\nIn January 1999, Roman Doroniuk was named president and chief operating officers of Lionsgate, which led to the corporation's financial operations being moved in April to Doroniuk's offices in Toronto, Ontario while corporate headquarters remained in Vancouver, British Columbia. Lionsgate created US based Avalanche Films and acquired half of Sterling Home Entertainment, both in video sales. Again, Lionsgate registered losses in its second year of $9.3 million on revenues of $78.3 million with most of the losses were from its stake in Mandalay Pictures. Thus in the summer, Lionsgate placed its studios up for sale with no buyers. TV operations were changed to non-network hourlong series over riskier network shows and ended its relationship with Mandalay Television. The corporation sought out more capital and cash with a filing of a preliminary prospectus for the sale of preferred stock and common stock warrants and a $13.4 million line of credit.[9]\\r\\nAdditional acquisition funding arrived in January 2000 as a $33.1 million investment from an investor group that included Paul Allen, former Sony Pictures executive Jon Feltheimer, German broadcasting company Tele-Munchen, and SBS Broadcasting SA. This led to Feltheimer taking over as CEO from Giustra thus the passed over Doroniuk left the company. Feltheimer increased film making including several $1 million films at Avalanche. However, Federgreen still remains one of the major owners of the company and is extremely involved in the making of all their major movies. In June, Lionsgate acquired Trimark Holdings, Inc. for approximately $50 million in stock and cash including taking on $36 million in debt.[9]\\r\\nLionsgate continued making acquisitions during the decade to boost distribution and its film library. On December 15, 2003, Lionsgate acquired Artisan Entertainment for $220 million.[11] In 2004, Erik Nelson reacquired Termite Art and renamed it to Creative Differences.[12]\\r\\nLionsgate partnered with Panamax Films in 2005 to make movies for the Latino market which only produced two films.[13] On April 13, 2005, Lionsgate spun off its Canadian distribution unit into a new distribution unit called Maple Pictures under the direction of two former Lionsgate executives, Brad Pelman and Laurie May.[14][15][16] On August 1, 2005, Lions Gate Entertainment acquired the entire library of Modern Entertainment, the U.S. film division of the Swedish television company Modern Times Group.[17][18] On October 17, 2005, Lionsgate acquired UK company Redbus Film Distribution for $35 million[19][20][21] and became Lionsgate UK on February 23, 2006.[22][23]\\r\\nOn March 15, 2006, Lionsgate sold Lionsgate Studios to Bosa Development Corporation.[24] On July 12, Lionsgate purchased Debmar-Mercury, an independent television distributor, which has continued operations as a Lionsgate subsidiary.[25] The company agreed in August to lease term with New Mexico State Land Office and the city of Rio Rancho for a new 52.8 acres studio near Rio Rancho's under construction city center and arena.[26]\\r\\nOn July 26, 2007, Lionsgate bought a partial stake in independent film distribution company Roadside Attractions.[27] Lionsgate started up Lionsgate Music by June 2007.[28] On September 10, 2007, Lionsgate bought Mandate Pictures for $56.3 million, $44.3 million in cash and $12 million in stock, and taking on $6.6 million of Mandate's debt. Mandate Chief Executive Joe Drake returned to the company as co-chief operating officer of its film unit.[29]\\r\\nBy July 2008, Lionsgate has not made any progress on building its new film studio in Rio Rancho or on setting up the corporation to run the studio per its agreement with New Mexico.[30]\\r\\nIn January 2009, Lionsgate purchased TV Guide Network and TVGuide.com from Rovi for $255 million cash.[31] In May 2009, Lionsgate sold a 49% stake in TV Guide Network and website to One Equity Partners under pressure from shareholder Carl Icahn.[32]\\r\\nLionsgate cut back its slate of films per year by four in February 2009. In April, Relativity Media signed with Lionsgate for a 5 picture per year multi-year film distribution.[33] In August, Lionsgate signed with Redbox for a five-year same day release deal worth $158 million.[34] Lionsgate, along with MGM and Paramount Pictures/Viacom, was also a co-owner of Epix, a pay TV movie channel which debuted on October 30.[35][36]\\r\\nOn September 13, 2010, Lionsgate and Televisa formed a joint venture, Pantelion Films, to produce for the next five years eight to 10 films a year targeted for the U.S. Latino market.[13]\\r\\nLionsgate sold off its Canadian distribution unit, Maple Pictures, in September 2011 to Alliance Films.[37]\\r\\nLionsgate announced on January 13, 2012, that it had acquired Summit Entertainment, producers and distributors of the Twilight Saga films, for $412.5?million.[38] The two companies have planned on merging since 2008.[39] On October 6, 2012, Lions Gate Entertainment announced that Brian Goldsmith became the co-COO of the company and joining co-COO Steve Beeks.[40] On November 18, 2012, Lionsgate announced it has passed over the $1?billion mark for the first time with the success of The Hunger Games and The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn ÿ Part 2.[41]\\r\\nOn December 23, 2013, Lionsgate announced they have crossed over $1 billion domestically and internationally for the 2nd year in a row with the success of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Now You See Me, Instructions Not Included, and Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain.[42][43]\\r\\nOn April 14, 2014, Comcast acquired the remaining stakes in Fearnet from LGF and Sony Pictures Entertainment.[44] On April 21, 2014, Lionsgate announced that they will merge its movie marketing operations.[45] A few days later, on April 30, Lionsgate announced that the studios will expand into the gaming development.[46]\\r\\nIn 2015, Lionsgate took over the distribution functions for CBS Films, the film division of CBS Corporation.[47]\\r\\nOn February 11, 2015, John C. Malone swapped a 4.5% stake with 14.5% of the voting power in Starz Inc. for 3.4% of Lionsgates shares while joining the company's board of directors.[48][49] Fourteen days later, Starz CEO Chris Albrecht hinted a possible merger with Lionsgate.[50]\\r\\nOn April 1, 2015, according to Deadline, Lionsgate announced it has created its new label, Lionsgate Premiere. This new label will handle up to 15 releases a year, targeting young audiences at theaters and digital outlets. The new label, part of the companys diversification effort, will incorporate Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment titles (including the Step Up film series and the Red film series) and then specialize in innovative multiplatform and other release strategies to reach affinity audiences with branded content and targeted marketing. Marketing and Research SVP Jean McDowell will handle marketing, with distribution to be run by Adam Sorensen, who currently manages Western Sales.[51]\\r\\nOn November 10, 2015, Malone's other two companies, Liberty Global and Discovery Communications, made a joint investment of $195ÿ400 million in Lionsgate and acquired a 3.4% stake in the company.[52][53][54][55][56] Then on June 30, 2016, Lionsgate agreed to acquire Starz Inc. for $4.4 billion in cash and stock.[57] As of December 2016, it became the parent company of Starz Inc.[58]\\r\\nOn November 12, 2015, Lionsgate created a partnership with Armenian American television producer Craig Piligian when the studio acquired more than 50% of his Pilgrim Studios company worth $200 million. Piligian retained his position as CEO of the company while Pilgrim will continue to operate independently under Piligian.[51][49][59] The deal made Lionsgate a major unscripted player.[51]\\r\\nOn July 13, 2016, Lionsgate acquired a minority stake in British unscripted television production startup company Primal Media. It was launched by Matt Steiner and Adam Wood, who originally launched Gogglebox Entertainment that was acquired by Sony Pictures Television.[60]\\r\\nFollowing the Weinstein effect, Lionsgate was listed as one of 22 potential buyers interested in acquiring The Weinstein Company.[61] The company also showed interest in investing in French film producer and director Luc Besson's company EuropaCorp.[62]\\r\\nIn 2018, Lionsgate's newly-launched digital content unit, Studio L, announced its first slate.[63]\\r\\nIn January 2018, it was reported that Lionsgate was being subject to a bidding war for a possible acquisition, with Amazon.com, CBS Corporation, Comcast, Verizon Communications, and Viacom having made offers.[64][65][66]\\r\\nLionsgate Vice Chairman Michael Burns has stated in an interview with CNBC that Lionsgate is mostly interested in merging with CBS and Viacom.[66] Viacom and Lionsgate were both interested in acquiring The Weinstein Company.[67]\\r\\nOn February 27, 2018, a month after the bidding war announcement, Variety reported in a detailed article that toy manufacturing company Hasbro (which has recently collaborated with the company in the 2017 film My Little Pony: The Movie via its Allspark Pictures theatrical film financing unit which is in turn owned by its Hasbro Studios division) came close to also acquiring Lionsgate last year, but the deal fell through.[68]\\r\\nThe distribution of selected recent non-in-house films for pay-per-view and on-demand are under the supervision of NBCUniversal Television Distribution under Universal Pictures (Universal formerly held home video and television rights to many of the early Lionsgate films), while all others (particularly the in-house films) are distributed for both cable and broadcast television through Lionsgate's syndicated division.\\r\\nAside from home video distribution of films sub-licensed from other studios, Lionsgate's library consists of its own in-house productions, as well as films from Summit Entertainment and several defunct studios, including Trimark Pictures (acquired in 2000), Artisan Entertainment (acquired in 2003), Overture Films (Starz's former feature film division whose library Lionsgate acquired after the 2016 Starz merger) and Vestron Pictures (acquired by Artisan in 1991). Their complete ownership depends on the worldwide regions of license.\\r\\nLionsgate Television produced such series as Nashville, Anger Management, The Dead Zone, 5ive Days to Midnight, Weeds, Nurse Jackie, Boss, Tyler Perry's House of Payne and the Emmy Award-winning Mad Men. Lionsgate also acquired TV syndication firm Debmar-Mercury in 2006[69] with 20th Television handling ad-sales with the exception for Meet the Browns, as the ad-sales are handled by DisneyÿABC Domestic Television and Turner Television co-distributing the series. Lionsgate also co-owns Pop with CBS Corporation. In March 2013, Lionsgate signed with Mars One (a Dutch nonprofit with space agency and aerospace backers intent on colonizing Mars) to produce a reality TV show.[70]\\r\\nThe company owns Starz, a premium-tier cable network with it all related channels including Starz Encore, and Movieplex.

It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1,220 kilometres (760 miles), which is about 70% of the Moon's radius.[1][2] It is composed of an ironÿnickel alloy and some light elements. The temperature at the inner core boundary is approximately 5700?K (5400?C).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth was discovered to have a solid inner core distinct from its liquid outer core in 1936, by the Danish seismologist Inge Lehmann,[4] who deduced its presence by studying seismograms from earthquakes in New Zealand. She observed that the seismic waves reflect off the boundary of the inner core and can be detected by sensitive seismographs on the Earth's surface. This boundary is known as the Bullen discontinuity,[5] or sometimes as the Lehmann discontinuity.[6] A few years later, in 1940, it was hypothesized that this inner core was made of solid iron; its rigidity was confirmed in 1971.[7]\\r\\nThe outer core was determined to be liquid from observations showing that compressional waves pass through it, but elastic shear waves do not?ÿ or do so only very weakly.[8] The solidity of the inner core had been difficult to establish because the elastic shear waves that are expected to pass through a solid mass are very weak and difficult for seismographs on the Earth's surface to detect, since they become so attenuated on their way from the inner core to the surface by their passage through the liquid outer core. Dziewonski and Gilbert established that measurements of normal modes of vibration of Earth caused by large earthquakes were consistent with a liquid outer core.[9] It has recently been claimed that shear waves have been detected passing through the inner core; these claims were initially controversial, but are now gaining acceptance.[10]\\r\\nBased on the relative prevalence of various chemical elements in the Solar System, the theory of planetary formation, and constraints imposed or implied by the chemistry of the rest of the Earth's volume, the inner core is believed to consist primarily of a nickel-iron alloy. Pure iron was found to be denser than the core by approximately 3%, implying the presence of light elements in the core (e.g. silicon, oxygen, sulfur) in addition to the probable presence of nickel.[11]\\r\\nFurther, if the primordial and mostly fluid (still forming) earth contained any significant mass(es) of elements denser than iron and nickel, namely the white (appearance) precious metals (and a few others) except silver, specifically the siderophile elements then these would necessarily have differentiated to the very center of the core into concentric nested spheres by Planetary differentiation. The most dense (and stable, i.e. platinum, iridium, and osmium, (etc.) in order of density) of these forming the innermost spheroid(s).[12] While unstable elements of such trans-iron/nickel density would have mostly decayed to iron/nickel/lead by the time the earth formed a discrete core.\\r\\nIt then necessarily follows that all, or almost all, of these denser elements we have mined (or are even able to) at the surface (or near surface, or even at all \\"above\\" the core) have been delivered later as part of impact objects/masses.[13]\\r\\nThe temperature of the inner core can be estimated by considering both the theoretical and the experimentally demonstrated constraints on the melting temperature of impure iron at the pressure which iron is under at the boundary of the inner core (about 330?GPa). These considerations suggest that its temperature is about 5,700?K (5,400?C; 9,800?F).[3] The pressure in the Earth's inner core is slightly higher than it is at the boundary between the outer and inner cores: it ranges from about 330 to 360 gigapascals (3,300,000 to 3,600,000?atm).[14] Iron can be solid at such high temperatures only because its melting temperature increases dramatically at pressures of that magnitude (see the ClausiusÿClapeyron relation).[15]\\r\\nA report published in the journal Science [16] concludes that the melting temperature of iron at the inner core boundary is 6230 I 500?K, roughly 1000?K higher than previous estimates.\\r\\nThe Earth's inner core is thought to be slowly growing as the liquid outer core at the boundary with the inner core cools and solidifies due to the gradual cooling of the Earth's interior (about 100 degrees Celsius per billion years).[17] Many scientists had initially expected that the inner core would be found to be homogeneous, because the solid inner core was originally formed by a gradual cooling of molten material, and continues to grow as a result of that same process. Even though it is growing into liquid, it is solid, due to the very high pressure that keeps it compacted together even if the temperature is extremely high. It was even suggested that Earth's inner core might be a single crystal of iron.[18] However, this prediction was disproved by observations indicating that in fact there is a degree of disorder within the inner core.[19] Seismologists have found that the inner core is not completely uniform, but instead contains large-scale structures such that seismic waves pass more rapidly through some parts of the inner core than through others.[20] In addition, the properties of the inner core's surface vary from place to place across distances as small as 1?km. This variation is surprising, since lateral temperature variations along the inner-core boundary are known to be extremely small (this conclusion is confidently constrained by magnetic field observations). Recent discoveries suggest that the solid inner core itself is composed of layers, separated by a transition zone about 250 to 400?km thick.[21] If the inner core grows by small frozen sediments falling onto its surface, then some liquid can also be trapped in the pore spaces and some of this residual fluid may still persist to some small degree in much of its interior.\\r\\nBecause the inner core is not rigidly connected to the Earth's solid mantle, the possibility that it rotates slightly faster or slower than the rest of Earth has long been entertained.[22][23] In the 1990s, seismologists made various claims about detecting this kind of super-rotation by observing changes in the characteristics of seismic waves passing through the inner core over several decades, using the aforementioned property that it transmits waves faster in some directions. Estimates of this super-rotation are around one degree of extra rotation per year.\\r\\nGrowth of the inner core is thought to play an important role in the generation of Earth's magnetic field by dynamo action in the liquid outer core. This occurs mostly because it cannot dissolve the same amount of light elements as the outer core and therefore freezing at the inner core boundary produces a residual liquid that contains more light elements than the overlying liquid. This causes it to become buoyant and helps drive convection of the outer core.[citation needed] The existence of the inner core also changes the dynamic motions of liquid in the outer core as it grows and may help fix the magnetic field since it is expected to be a great deal more resistant to flow than the outer core liquid (which is expected to be turbulent).[citation needed]\\r\\nSpeculation also continues that the inner core might have exhibited a variety of internal deformation patterns. This may be necessary to explain why seismic waves pass more rapidly in some directions than in others.[24] Because thermal convection alone appears to be improbable,[25] any buoyant convection motions will have to be driven by variations in composition or abundance of liquid in its interior. S. Yoshida and colleagues proposed a novel mechanism whereby deformation of the inner core can be caused by a higher rate of freezing at the equator than at polar latitudes,[26] and S. Karato proposed that changes in the magnetic field might also deform the inner core slowly over time.[27]\\r\\nThere is an EastÿWest asymmetry in the inner core seismological data. There is a model which explains this by differences at the surface of the inner core ÿ melting in one hemisphere and crystallization in the other.[28] The western hemisphere of the inner core may be crystallizing, whereas the eastern hemisphere may be melting. This may lead to enhanced magnetic field generation in the crystallizing hemisphere, creating the asymmetry in the Earth's magnetic field.[29]\\r\\nBased on rates of cooling of the core, it is estimated that the current solid inner core started solidifying approximately 0.5 to 2 billion years ago[30] out of a fully molten core (which formed just after planetary formation). If true, this would mean that the Earth's solid inner core is not a primordial feature that was present during the planet's formation, but a feature younger than the Earth (the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old).","input":"What is the earth core made up of?"},{"output":"ninth","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCMSgt insignia\\r\\n\\r\\n(1994ÿpresent)\\r\\n\\r\\nChief Master Sergeant (CMSgt) is the ninth, and highest, enlisted rank in the U.S. Air Force, just above Senior Master Sergeant, and is a senior non-commissioned officer rank.

CCMs provide leadership to the enlisted force and are the functional managers for group superintendents and first sergeants in their organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nGroup superintendents fall under special reporting identifier coding with a 9G100 Air Force specialty code. Group superintendents provide leadership, management, and guidance in organizing, equipping, training, and mobilizing groups to meet home station and expeditionary mission requirements. Group superintendents work closely with their group commanders and command chief master sergeants to prepare the enlisted force to best execute mission requirements. They manage and direct resource activities as well as interpret and enforce policies and applicable directives. They also establish control procedures to meet mission goals and standards. Additionally, they recommend or initiate actions to improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency as well as ensure that the management of personnel and resources are consistent with current practices and procedures in support of the wings mission. They resolve issues between subordinate sq-rons, other groups, wing staff, and outside agencies as well as perform other duties as directed by their group commanders.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duty position of squadron superintendent is the senior enlisted advisor to a unit commander.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nObsolete\\r\\n\\r\\nCMSgt insignia\\r\\n\\r\\n(1958ÿ1994)\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Air Force had been an independent service since 1947, the rank of chief master Sergeant did not come into being until the authorization of the Military Pay Act of 1958.  This act established the pay grades of E-8 and E-9, but without specifying titles for those pay grades.  It wasn't until late 1958 that the title chief master sergeant (and the accompanying rank insignia) was decided upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Chief Master Sergeant rank insignia (1958ÿ1994) consisted of 2 chevrons on top, 3 stripes in the middle, and 3 rockers on bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil his retirement in 2003, Chief Master Sergeant Norman Marous was the Air Force's senior-most chief master sergeant, having served in the Air Force since 1962. Marous left active duty in 1967 to spend 22 years in the USAF Reserve and National Guard before returning to active duty as a Chief Master Sergeant in 1989. He retired in 2003 with 41? years of service. He is the only person authorized to wear two longevity ribbons, due to the space required for the number of multiple award devices authorized.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nChief master sergeant is since 2004 and as part of the ongoing modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the highest possible rank attained by enlisted personnel of the Philippine Army, the Philippine Air Force and the Philippine Marine Corps (under the Philippine Navy). Above the rank is that of first chief master sergeant, created also in the same year and is bestowed on the most veteran NCO who has served in the aforementioned service branches. The rank stands above that of senior master sergeant. The equivalent naval rating is that of master chief petty officer.","input":"What rank is cmsgt in the air force?"},{"output":"Robert Whittaker","context":"In biology, kingdom (Latin: regnum, plural regna) is the second highest taxonomic rank, just below domain. Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla. Traditionally, some textbooks from the United States used a system of six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaeabacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria) while textbooks in Great Britain, India, Australia, Latin America and other countries used five kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera). Some recent classifications based on modern cladistics have explicitly abandoned the term \\"kingdom\\", noting that the traditional kingdoms are not monophyletic, i.e., do not consist of all the descendants of a common ancestor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Carolus Linnaeus introduced the rank-based system of nomenclature into biology in 1735, the highest rank was given the name \\"kingdom\\" and was followed by four other main or principal ranks: class, order, genus and species.[1] Later two further main ranks were introduced, making the sequence kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus and species.[2] In the 1960s a rank was introduced above kingdom, namely domain (or empire), so that kingdom is no longer the highest rank.\\r\\nPrefixes can be added so subkingdom (subregnum) and infrakingdom (also known as infraregnum) are the two ranks immediately below kingdom. Superkingdom may be considered as an equivalent of domain or empire or as an independent rank between kingdom and domain or subdomain. In some classification systems the additional rank branch (Latin: ramus) can be inserted between subkingdom and infrakingdom (e.g. Protostomia and Deuterostomia in the classification of Cavalier-Smith[3]).\\r\\nFrom around the mid-1970s onwards, there was an increasing emphasis on comparisons of genes at the molecular level (initially ribosomal RNA genes) as the primary factor in classification; genetic similarity was stressed over outward appearances and behavior. Taxonomic ranks, including kingdoms, were to be groups of organisms with a common ancestor, whether monophyletic (all descendants of a common ancestor) or paraphyletic (only some descendants of a common ancestor).[citation needed] Based on such RNA studies, Carl Woese thought life could be divided into three large divisions and referred to them as the \\"three primary kingdom\\" model or \\"urkingdom\\" model.[4] In 1990, the name \\"domain\\" was proposed for the highest rank.[5] This term represents a synonym for the category of dominion (lat. dominium), introduced by Moore in 1974.[6] Unlike Moore, Woese et al. (1990) did not suggest a Latin term for this category, which represents a further argument supporting the accurately introduced term dominion.[7] Woese divided the prokaryotes (previously classified as the Kingdom Monera) into two groups, called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, stressing that there was as much genetic difference between these two groups as between either of them and all eukaryotes.\\r\\nAccording to genetic data, although eukaryote groups such as plants, fungi, and animals may look different, they are more closely related to each other than they are to either the Eubacteria or Archaea. It was also found that the eukaryotes are more closely related to the Archaea than they are to the Eubacteria. Although the primacy of the Eubacteria-Archaea divide has been questioned, it has been upheld by subsequent research.[8] There is no consensus on how many kingdoms exist in the classification scheme proposed by Woese.\\r\\nIn 2004, a review article by Simpson and Roger noted that the Protista were \\"a grab-bag for all eukaryotes that are not animals, plants or fungi\\". They held that only monophyletic groups should be accepted as formal ranks in a classification and that - while this approach had been impractical previously (necessitating \\"literally dozens of eukaryotic 'kingdoms'\\") - it had now become possible to divide the eukaryotes into \\"just a few major groups that are probably all monophyletic\\".\\r\\nOn this basis, the diagram opposite (redrawn from their article) showed the real \\"kingdoms\\" (their quotation marks) of the eukaryotes.[9] A classification which followed this approach was produced in 2005 for the International Society of Protistologists, by a committee which \\"worked in collaboration with specialists from many societies\\". It divided the eukaryotes into the same six \\"supergroups\\".[10] The published classification deliberately did not use formal taxonomic ranks, including that of \\"kingdom\\".\\r\\nBacteria\\r\\nArchaea\\r\\nExcavata  Various flagellate protozoa\\r\\nAmoebozoa  most lobose amoeboids and slime moulds\\r\\nOpisthokonta  animals, fungi, choanoflagellates, etc.\\r\\nRhizaria  Foraminifera, Radiolaria, and various other amoeboid protozoa\\r\\nChromalveolata  Stramenopiles (Brown Algae, Diatoms etc.), Haptophyta, Cryptophyta (or cryptomonads), and Alveolata\\r\\nArchaeplastida (or Primoplantae)  Land plants, green algae, red algae, and glaucophytes\\r\\nIn this system the multicellular animals (Metazoa) are descended from the same ancestor as both the unicellular choanoflagellates and the fungi which form the Opisthokonta.[10] Plants are thought to be more distantly related to animals and fungi.\\r\\nHowever, in the same year as the International Society of Protistologists' classification was published (2005), doubts were being expressed as to whether some of these supergroups were monophyletic, particularly the Chromalveolata,[11] and a review in 2006 noted the lack of evidence for several of the supposed six supergroups.[12]\\r\\nAs of 2010[update], there is widespread agreement that the Rhizaria belong with the Stramenopiles and the Alveolata, in a clade dubbed the SAR supergroup,[13] so that Rhizaria is not one of the main eukaryote groups.[14][15][16][17][18] Beyond this, there does not appear to be a consensus. Rogozin et al. in 2009 noted that \\"The deep phylogeny of eukaryotes is an extremely difficult and controversial problem.\\"[19] As of December 2010[update], there appears to be a consensus that the 2005 six supergroup model does not reflect the true phylogeny of the eukaryotes and hence how they should be classified, although there is no agreement as to the model which should replace it.[15][16][20]\\r\\nThe classification of living things into animals and plants is an ancient one. Aristotle (384ÿ322 BC) classified animal species in his History of Animals, while his pupil Theophrastus (c. 371ÿc. 287 BC) wrote a parallel work, the Historia Plantarum, on plants.[21]\\r\\nCarl Linnaeus (1707ÿ1778) laid the foundations for modern biological nomenclature, now regulated by the Nomenclature Codes, in 1735. He distinguished two kingdoms of living things: Regnum Animale ('animal kingdom') and Regnum Vegetabile ('vegetable kingdom', for plants). Linnaeus also included minerals in his classification system, placing them in a third kingdom, Regnum Lapideum.\\r\\nRegnum Vegetabile\\r\\nRegnum Animale\\r\\nIn 1674, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, often called the \\"father of microscopy\\", sent the Royal Society of London a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms. Until then, the existence of such microscopic organisms was entirely unknown. Despite this, Linnaeus did not include any microscopic creatures in his original taxonomy.\\r\\nAt first, microscopic organisms were classified within the animal and plant kingdoms. However, by the mid-19th century, it had become clear to many that \\"the existing dichotomy of the plant and animal kingdoms [had become] rapidly blurred at its boundaries and outmoded\\".[22] In 1866, Ernst Haeckel proposed a third kingdom of life, the Protista, for \\"neutral organisms\\" which were neither animal nor plant. Haeckel revised the content of this kingdom a number of times before settling on a division based on whether organisms were unicellular (Protista) or multicellular (animals and plants).[22]\\r\\nKingdom Plantae\\r\\nKingdom Protista\\r\\nKingdom Animalia\\r\\nThe development of the electron microscope revealed important distinctions between those unicellular organisms whose cells do not have a distinct nucleus (prokaryotes) and those unicellular and multicellular organisms whose cells do have a distinct nucleus (eukaryotes). In 1938, Herbert F. Copeland proposed a four-kingdom classification, elevating the protist classes of bacteria (Monera) and blue-green algae (Phycochromacea) to phyla in the novel Kingdom Monera.[22]\\r\\nThe importance of the distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes gradually became apparent. In the 1960s, Stanier and van Niel popularised douard Chatton's much earlier proposal to recognise this division in a formal classification. This required the creation, for the first time, of a rank above kingdom, a superkingdom or empire, later called a domain.[23]\\r\\nKingdom Monera\\r\\nKingdom Protista\\r\\nKingdom Plantae\\r\\nKingdom Animalia\\r\\n The differences between fungi and other organisms regarded as plants had long been recognised by some; Haeckel had moved the fungi out of Plantae into Protista after his original classification,[22] but was largely ignored in this separation by scientists of his time. Robert Whittaker recognized an additional kingdom for the Fungi. The resulting five-kingdom system, proposed in 1969 by Whittaker, has become a popular standard and with some refinement is still used in many works and forms the basis for new multi-kingdom systems. It is based mainly upon differences in nutrition; his Plantae were mostly multicellular autotrophs, his Animalia multicellular heterotrophs, and his Fungi multicellular saprotrophs. The remaining two kingdoms, Protista and Monera, included unicellular and simple cellular colonies.[24] The five kingdom system may be combined with the two empire system:\\r\\nKingdom Monera\\r\\nKingdom Fungi\\r\\nKingdom Protista\\r\\nKingdom Plantae\\r\\nKingdom Animalia\\r\\nIn the Whittaker system, Plantae included some algae. In other systems (e.g., Margulis system), Plantae included just the land plants (Embryophyta).\\r\\nDespite the development from two kingdoms to five among most scientists, some authors as late as 1975 continued to employ a traditional two-kingdom system of animals and plants, dividing the plant kingdom into Subkingdoms Prokaryota (bacteria and cyanophytes), Mycota (fungi and supposed relatives), and Chlorota (algae and land plants).[25]\\r\\nThomas Cavalier-Smith thought at first, as it was nearly consensually admitted at that time, that the difference between eubacteria and archaebacteria was so great (particularly considering the genetic distance of ribosomal genes) that they needed to be separated into two different kingdoms, hence splitting the empire Bacteria into two kingdoms. He then divided Eubacteria into two subkingdoms: Negibacteria (Gram negative bacteria) and Posibacteria (Gram positive bacteria).\\r\\nTechnological advances in electron microscopy allowed the separation of the Chromista from the Plantae kingdom. Indeed, the chloroplast of the chromists is located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum instead of in the cytosol. Moreover, only chromists contain chlorophyll c. Since then, many non-photosynthetic phyla of protists, thought to have secondarily lost their chloroplasts, were integrated into the kingdom Chromista.\\r\\nFinally, some protists lacking mitochondria were discovered.[26] As mitochondria were known to be the result of the endosymbiosis of a proteobacterium, it was thought that these amitochondriate eukaryotes were primitively so, marking an important step in eukaryogenesis. As a result, these amitochondriate protists were separated from the protist kingdom, giving rise to the, at the same time, superkingdom and kingdom Archezoa. This was known as the Archezoa hypothesis. This superkingdom was opposed to the Metakaryota superkingdom, grouping together the five other eukaryotic kingdoms (Animalia, Protozoa, Fungi, Plantae and Chromista).\\r\\nIn 1998, Cavalier-Smith published a six-kingdom model,[3] which has been revised in subsequent papers. The version published in 2009 is shown below.[14] (Compared to the version he published in 2004,[27] the alveolates and the rhizarians have been moved from Kingdom Protozoa to Kingdom Chromista.) Cavalier-Smith no longer accepts the importance of the fundamental eubacteriaÿarchaebacteria divide put forward by Woese and others and supported by recent research.[8] His Kingdom Bacteria includes Archaebacteria as a phylum of the subkingdom Unibacteria which comprises only one other phylum: the Posibacteria. The two subkingdoms Unibacteria and Negibacteria of kingdom Bacteria (sole kingdom of empire Prokaryota) are opposed according to their membrane topologies. The bimembranous-unimembranous transition is thought to be far more fundamental than the long branch of genetic distance of Archaebacteria, viewed as having no particular biological significance. Cavalier-Smith does not accept the requirement for taxa to be monophyletic (\\"holophyletic\\" in his terminology) to be valid. He defines Prokaryota, Bacteria, Negibacteria, Unibacteria and Posibacteria as valid paraphyletic (therefore \\"monophyletic\\" in the sense he uses this term) taxa, marking important innovations of biological significance (in regard of the concept of biological niche).\\r\\nIn the same way, his paraphyletic kingdom Protozoa includes the ancestors of Animalia, Fungi, Plantae and Chromista. The advances of phylogenetic studies allowed Cavalier-Smith to realize that all the phyla thought to be archezoans (i.e. primitively amitochondriate eukaryotes) had in fact secondarily lost their mitochondria, most of the time by transforming them into new organelles: hydrogenosomes. This means that all living eukaryotes are in fact metakaryotes, according to the significance of the term given by Cavalier-Smith. Some of the members of the defunct kingdom Archezoa, like the phylum Microsporidia, were reclassified into kingdom Fungi. Others were reclassified in kingdom Protozoa like Metamonada which is now part of infrakingdom Excavata.\\r\\nThe diagram below does not represent an evolutionary tree.\\r\\nKingdom Bacteria  includes Archaebacteria as part of a subkingdom\\r\\nKingdom Protozoa  e.g. Amoebozoa, Choanozoa, Excavata\\r\\nKingdom Chromista  e.g. Alveolata, cryptophytes, Heterokonta (Brown Algae, Diatoms etc.), Haptophyta, Rhizaria\\r\\nKingdom Plantae  e.g. glaucophytes, red and green algae, land plants\\r\\nKingdom Fungi\\r\\nKingdom Animalia\\r\\nCavalier-Smith and his collaborators revised the classification in 2015, and published it in PLOS ONE. In this scheme they reintroduced the division of prokaryotes into two kingdoms, Bacteria (=Eubacteria) and Archaea (=Archaebacteria). This is based on the consensus in the Taxonomic Outline of Bacteria and Archaea (TOBA) and the Catalogue of Life.[28]\\r\\nA summary of the different kinds of proposed classification schemes presented in this article is summarized in the table below.\\r\\nThe kingdom-level classification of life is still widely employed as a useful way of grouping organisms, notwithstanding some problems with this approach:\\r\\nThere is ongoing debate as to whether viruses, obligate intracellular parasites that lack metabolism and are not capable of replication outside of a host, can be included in the tree of life.[47][48][49] If included, their placement in the tree would be problematic since it is suspected that viruses have arisen multiple times, and they have a penchant for accumulating nucleotide sequences from their hosts. A principal reason for inclusion comes from the discovery of unusually large and complex viruses, such as Mimivirus, that possess typical cellular genes.[50]","input":"Who introduced the five kingdom system of classification?"},{"output":"control of the lake","context":"East Coast\\r\\nGreat Lakes / Saint Lawrence River\\r\\nWest Indies / Gulf Coast\\r\\nPacific Ocean\\r\\nThe Battle of Lake Erie, sometimes called the Battle of Put-in-Bay, was fought on 10 September 1813, in Lake Erie off the coast of Ohio during the War of 1812. Nine vessels of the United States Navy defeated and captured six vessels of the British Royal Navy. This ensured American control of the lake for the rest of the war, which in turn allowed the Americans to recover Detroit and win the Battle of the Thames to break the Indian confederation of Tecumseh. It was one of the biggest naval battles of the War of 1812.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the war broke out, the British immediately seized control of Lake Erie. They already had a small force of warships there: the sloop-of-war Queen Charlotte and the brig General Hunter. The schooner Lady Prevost was under construction and was put into service a few weeks after the outbreak of war. These vessels were controlled by the Provincial Marine, which was a military transport service and not a naval service. Nevertheless, the Americans lacked any counter to the British armed vessels. The only American warship on Lake Erie, the brig Adams, was not ready for service at the start of the war, and when the American army of Brigadier General William Hull abandoned its invasion of Canada, Adams was pinned down in Detroit by the British batteries at Sandwich on the Canadian side of the Detroit River. The British Major-General Isaac Brock used his control of the lake to defeat Hull's army at the Siege of Detroit, by cutting the American supply lines and rapidly transferring himself and some reinforcements to Amherstburg from where they launched a successful landing on the American side of the Detroit River.\\r\\nThe British took Adams when Detroit was surrendered, renaming her Detroit. Together with the brig Caledonia, which had been commandeered from the Canadian North West Company, she was boarded and captured near Fort Erie on 9 October, by American sailors and soldiers led by Lieutenant Jesse Elliot. Detroit ran aground on an island in the middle of the Niagara River and was set on fire to prevent her being recaptured. Caledonia was taken to the navy yard at Black Rock and commissioned into the United States Navy.[3] Also present at Black Rock were the schooners Somers and Ohio and the sloop-rigged Trippe, which had all been purchased by the United States Navy and were being converted into gunboats.[4] While the British held Fort Erie and the nearby batteries which dominated the Niagara River, all these vessels were pinned down and unable to leave Black Rock.\\r\\nLate in 1812, Paul Hamilton, the United States Secretary of the Navy had received long-time American lake mariner Daniel Dobbins, who had escaped capture at Detroit and brought information on the British forces on Lake Erie. Dobbins recommended the bay of Presque Isle in Erie, Pennsylvania as a naval base on the lake. (\\"Presqu'isle\\" is French for \\"peninsula\\", literally \\"almost an island\\"). Dobbins was dispatched to build four gunboats there, although Lieutenant Elliot objected to the lack of facilities.[5] Commodore Isaac Chauncey had been appointed to command of the United States naval forces on the Great Lakes in September 1812. He made one brief visit to Erie on 1 January 1813[6] where he approved Dobbins's actions and recommended collecting materials for a larger vessel, but then returned to Lake Ontario where he afterwards concentrated his energies.\\r\\nIn January 1813, William Jones (who had replaced Hamilton as the United States Secretary of the Navy) ordered the construction of two brig-rigged corvettes at Presque Isle, and transferred shipwright Noah Brown there from Sackets Harbor on Lake Ontario to take charge of construction. Other than their rig and crude construction (such as using wooden pegs instead of nails because of shortages of the latter), the two brigs were close copies of the contemporary USS?Hornet. The heaviest armament for the ships came from foundries on Chesapeake Bay, and were moved to Presque Isle only with great difficulty. (The Americans were fortunate in that some of their largest cannon had been dispatched shortly before raiding parties under Rear-Admiral George Cockburn destroyed a foundry at Frenchtown on the eastern seaboard.[7]) However, the Americans could get other materials and fittings from Pittsburgh, which was expanding as a manufacturing center, and smaller guns were borrowed from the Army.\\r\\nMaster Commandant Oliver Hazard Perry had earlier been appointed to command on Lake Erie, through lobbying by Jeremiah B. Howell, the Senior Senator from Rhode Island,[8] supplanting Lieutenant Elliot. He arrived at Presque Isle to take command at the end of March. Having arranged for the defense of Presque Isle, he proceeded to Lake Ontario to obtain reinforcements of seamen from Commodore Isaac Chauncey. After commanding the American schooners and gunboats at the Battle of Fort George, he then went to Black Rock where the American vessels had been released when the British abandoned Fort Erie at the end of May. Perry had them towed by draft oxen up the Niagara, an operation which took six days, and sailed with them along the shore to Presque Isle.[4]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Commander Robert Heriot Barclay was appointed to command the British squadron on Lake Erie. Another British officer had already endangered his career by refusing the appointment as success appeared unlikely.[9] Barclay missed a rendezvous with Queen Charlotte at Point Abino and was forced to make the tedious journey to Amherstburg overland, arriving on 10 June. He brought with him only a handful of officers and seamen. When he took command of his squadron, the crews of his vessels numbered only seven British seamen, 108 officers and men of the Provincial Marine (whose quality Barclay disparaged), 54 men of the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles and 106 soldiers, effectively landsmen, from the 41st Foot.[10] Nevertheless, he immediately set out in Queen Charlotte and Lady Prevost. He first reconnoitred Perry's base at Presque Isle and determined that it was defended by 2,000 Pennsylvania militia, with batteries and redoubts. He then cruised the eastern end of Lake Erie, hoping to intercept the American vessels from Black Rock. The weather was hazy, and he missed them.[11]\\r\\nDuring July and August, Barclay received two small vessels, the schooner Chippeway and the sloop Little Belt, which had been reconstructed at Chatham[12] on the Thames River and attempted to complete the ship-rigged corvette HMS?Detroit at Amherstburg. Because the Americans controlled Lake Ontario and occupied the Niagara Peninsula in early 1813, supplies for Barclay had to be carried overland from York. The American victory earlier in the year at the Battle of York resulted in the guns (24-pounder carronades) intended for Detroit falling into American hands.[13] Detroit had to be completed with a miscellany of guns from the fortifications of Amherstburg. Barclay claimed at his court martial that these guns lacked flintlock firing mechanisms and matches, and that they could be fired only by snapping flintlock pistols over powder piled in the vent holes.\\r\\nBarclay repeatedly requested men and supplies from Commodore James Lucas Yeo, commanding on Lake Ontario, but received very little. The commander of the British troops on the Detroit frontier, Major-General Henry Procter, was similarly starved of soldiers and munitions by his superiors. He declined to make an attack on Presque Isle unless he was reinforced, and instead he incurred heavy losses in an unsuccessful attack on Fort Stephenson, which he mounted at the urgings of some of his Indian warriors.[14]\\r\\nBy mid-July, the American squadron was almost complete, although not yet fully manned (Perry claimed to have only 120 men fit for duty). The British squadron maintained a blockade of Presque Isle for ten days from 20 July to 29 July. The harbour had a sandbar across its mouth, with only 5 feet (1.5?m) of water over it, which prevented Barclay sailing in to attack the American ships (although Barclay briefly skirmished with the defending batteries on 21 July), but also prevented the Americans leaving in fighting order. Barclay had to lift the blockade on 29 July because of shortage of supplies and bad weather. It has also been suggested that Barclay left to attend a banquet in his honour, or that he wished the Americans to cross the bar and hoped to find them in disarray when he returned.[5] Perry immediately began to move his vessels across the sandbar. This was an exhausting task. The guns had to be removed from all the boats, and the largest of them had to be raised between \\"camels\\" (barges or lighters which were then emptied of ballast). When Barclay returned four days later, he found that Perry had nearly completed the task. Perry's two largest brigs were not ready for action, but the gunboats and smaller brigs formed a line so confidently that Barclay withdrew to await the completion of Detroit.\\r\\nChauncey had dispatched 130 extra sailors under Lieutenant Jesse Elliot to Presque Isle.[15] Although Perry described some of them as \\"wretched\\", at least 50 of them were experienced sailors drafted from USS?Constitution, then undergoing a refit in Boston.[16] Perry also had a few volunteers from the Pennsylvania militia.\\r\\nHis vessels first proceeded to Sandusky, where they received further contingents of volunteers from Major General William Henry Harrison's Army of the Northwest.[17] After twice appearing off Amherstburg, Perry established an anchorage at Put-in-Bay, Ohio. For the next five weeks, Barclay was effectively blockaded and unable to move supplies to Amherstburg. His sailors, Procter's troops, and the very large numbers of Indian warriors and their families there quickly ran out of supplies. After receiving a last-minute reinforcement of two naval officers, three warrant officers and 36 sailors transferred from a transport temporarily laid up in Quebec[18] under Lieutenant George Bignall, Barclay had no choice but to put out again and seek battle with Perry.\\r\\nIn the days preceding the battle, Perry told his friend, Purser Samuel Hambleton, that he wanted a signal flag, or battle flag, to signal to his fleet when to engage the enemy. Hambleton suggested using the dying words of Perry's friend Captain James Lawrence of the frigate USS?Chesapeake, \\"Don't Give up the Ship\\". Hambleton had the flag sewn by women of Erie, and presented it to Perry the day before the battle. The flag would become an icon in American naval history.\\r\\nOn the morning of 10 September, the Americans saw Barclay's vessels heading for them, and got under way from their anchorage at Put-in-Bay. The wind was light. Barclay initially held the weather gauge, but the wind shifted and allowed Perry to close and attack. Both squadrons were in line of battle, with their heaviest vessels near the centre of the line.\\r\\nThe first shot was fired, from Detroit, at 11:45.[19] Perry hoped to get his two largest brigs, his flagship Lawrence and Niagara, into carronade range quickly, but in the light wind his vessels were making very little speed and Lawrence was battered by the assortment of long guns mounted in Detroit for at least 20 minutes before being able to reply effectively. When Lawrence was finally within carronade range at 12:45, her fire was not as effective as Perry hoped, her gunners apparently having overloaded the carronades with shot.[20]\\r\\nAstern of Lawrence, Niagara, under Elliot, was slow to come into action and remained far out of effective carronade range. It is possible that Elliott was under orders to engage his opposite number, Queen Charlotte, and that Niagara was obstructed by Caledonia, but Elliot's actions would become a matter of dispute between him and Perry for many years. Aboard Queen Charlotte, the British ship opposed to Niagara, the commander (Robert Finnis) and First Lieutenant were both killed. The next most senior officer, Lieutenant Irvine of the Provincial Marine, found that both Niagara and the American gunboats were far out of range, and passed the brig General Hunter to engage Lawrence at close range.[20]\\r\\nAlthough the American gunboats at the rear of the American line of battle steadily pounded the British ships in the centre of the action with raking shots from their long guns from a distance, Lawrence was reduced by the two British ships to a wreck. Four-fifths of Lawrence's crew were killed or wounded. Both of the fleet's surgeons were sick with lake fever,[21] so the wounded were taken care of by the assistant, Usher Parsons. When the last gun on Lawrence became unusable, Perry decided to transfer his flag. He was rowed a half mile (1?km) through heavy gunfire to Niagara while Lawrence was surrendered. (It was later alleged that he left Lawrence after the surrender, but Perry had actually taken down only his personal pennant, in blue bearing the motto, \\"Don't give up the ship\\".)\\r\\nWhen Lawrence surrendered, firing died away briefly.[22] Detroit collided with Queen Charlotte, both ships being almost unmanageable with damaged rigging and almost every officer killed or severely wounded. Barclay was severely wounded and his first lieutenant was killed, leaving Lieutenant Inglis in command. Most of the smaller British vessels were also disabled and drifting to leeward.[23] The British nevertheless expected Niagara to lead the American schooners away in retreat.[24] Instead, once aboard Niagara, Perry dispatched Elliot to bring the schooners into closer action, while he steered Niagara at Barclay's damaged ships, helped by the strengthening wind.\\r\\nNiagara broke through the British line ahead of Detroit and Queen Charlotte and luffed up to fire raking broadsides from ahead of them, while Caledonia and the American gunboats fired from astern. Although the crews of Detroit and Queen Charlotte managed to untangle the two ships[25] they could no longer offer any effective resistance. Both ships surrendered at about 3:00?pm. The smaller British vessels tried to flee but were overtaken and also surrendered.[26]\\r\\nAlthough Perry won the battle on Niagara, he received the British surrender on the deck of the recaptured Lawrence to allow the British to see the terrible price his men had paid.\\r\\nThe British lost 41 killed and 94 wounded. The surviving crews, including the wounded, numbered 306. Captain Barclay, who had previously lost his left arm in 1809, lost a leg and part of his thigh in the action while his remaining arm was rendered \\"permanently motionless\\". The Americans lost 27 killed and 96 wounded, of whom 2 later died.[27] The heaviest American casualties were suffered aboard Lawrence, which had 2 officers and 20 men killed, and 6 officers and 55 men wounded.[25]\\r\\nOf the vessels involved, the three most battered (the American brig Lawrence and the British ships Detroit and Queen Charlotte) were converted into hospital ships. A gale swept the lake on 13 September and dismasted Detroit and Queen Charlotte, further shattering the already battered ships. Once the wounded had been ferried to Erie, Lawrence was restored to service for 1814, but the two British ships were effectively reduced to hulks.[28]\\r\\nPerry's vessels and prizes were anchored and hasty repairs were underway near West Sister Island when Perry composed his now famous message to Harrison. Scrawled in pencil on the back of an old envelope, Perry wrote:\\r\\nDear General:\\r\\nWe have met the enemy and they are ours. Two ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop.\\r\\nYours with great respect and esteem,\\r\\nO.H. Perry[B]\\r\\nPerry next sent the following message to the Secretary of the Navy, William Jones:\\r\\nBrig Niagara, off the Western Sister,\\r\\nHead of Lake Erie, September 10, 1813, 4 P.M.\\r\\nSir:- It has pleased the Almighty to give to the arms of the United States a signal victory over their enemies on this lake. The British squadron, consisting of two ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop, have this moment surrendered to the force under my command after a sharp conflict.\\r\\nI have the honor to be, Sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\\r\\nO. H. Perry\\r\\nOnce his usable vessels and prizes were patched up, Perry ferried 2,500 American soldiers to Amherstburg, which was captured without opposition on 27 September. Meanwhile, 1,000 mounted troops led by Richard Mentor Johnson moved by land to Detroit, which also was recaptured without fighting on or about the same day. The British army under Procter had made preparations to abandon its positions even before Procter knew the result of the battle. In spite of exhortations from Tecumseh, who led the confederation of Indian tribes allied to Britain, Procter had already abandoned Amherstburg and Detroit and began to retreat up the Thames River on 27 September. Lacking supplies, Tecumseh's Indians had no option but to accompany him. Harrison caught up with Procter's retreating force and defeated them on 5 October at the Battle of the Thames, where Tecumseh was killed, as was his second-in command and most experienced warrior, Wyandot Chief Roundhead.\\r\\nThe victory on Lake Erie had disproportionate strategic import.[30] The Americans controlled Lake Erie for the remainder of the war. This accounted for much of the Americans' successes on the Niagara peninsula in 1814 and also removed the threat of a British attack on Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Western New York.\\r\\nHowever, an expedition in 1814 to recover Mackinac Island on Lake Huron failed, and the Americans lost eight of their smaller vessels and prizes. (Four were destroyed when the British captured Black Rock, where they were laid up, following the Battle of Buffalo at the end of 1813, and four were boarded and captured in separate incidents on Lake Erie and Lake Huron.)\\r\\nAfter the war, there was a bitter quarrel between Perry and Elliot over their respective parts in the action, mostly fought at second hand in the press. On the British side, Barclay was exonerated of any blame by a court-martial but was too badly injured to see service again for several years.\\r\\nIn 1820 Lawrence and Niagara were intentionally sunk near Misery Bay in Lake Erie, as they had \\"went to rot.\\"[31] In 1875, Lawrence was raised and moved to Philadelphia, where she was displayed at the 1876 Centennial Exposition. Later that year, the ship burned when the pavilion that housed it caught fire. Although Niagara was raised and restored in 1913, she subsequently fell into disrepair. She was eventually disassembled, and portions of her were used in a reconstructed Niagara, which is now on view in Erie, Pennsylvania.\\r\\nThe 352-foot (107?m) high Perry Monument within Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial now stands at Put-in-Bay, commemorating the men who fought in the battle.\\r\\nAnother 101-foot (31?m) high Perry Monument is located at the eastern end of Presque Isle in Erie Pennsylvania. It stands next to Presque Isle Bay, where Niagara and Lawrence were built, stationed along with the rest of the American Squadron, and then scuttled after the war.\\r\\nMost historians attribute the American victory to what Theodore Roosevelt described as, \\"Superior heavy metal\\".[32] Perry's leadership, particularly in the latter stages of the action, is also mentioned as a factor. The British historian C.S. Forester commented, \\"...it was as fortunate for the Americans that the Lawrence still possessed a boat that would float, as it was that Perry was not hit.\\"[22]\\r\\nOn the British side, William Bell served as constructor and built Detroit, which was the best-built ship on the lake. However, Detroit was built slowly, in part due to Bell's perfectionism, and indeed it was the only purpose-built British warship constructed on Lake Erie during the war. The guns intended for Detroit were seized by the Americans at the time of their raid on Fort York the year before. This building imbalance, given the fact that six American ships were built in the same time frame, was another important cause of the American victory (although it might be argued that, even if Barclay had possessed more hulls, he would have been unable to obtain armament and crews for them).\\r\\nThe court-martial of Captain Barclay and his surviving officers determined that the Captain, his officers and men had \\"conducted themselves in the most gallant manner\\" and found that the defeat was the result of American superiority, an insufficient number of able seamen and the early fall of superior officers in the action.[33]\\r\\nListed in order of sailing:[C]\\r\\nCoordinates: 413944N 824930W? / ?41.66222N 82.82500W? / 41.66222; -82.82500","input":"Why was the battle of lake erie fought?"},{"output":"an unofficial United States Navy award","context":"The Domain of the Golden Dragon is an unofficial United States Navy award.

For example, some customers ask for one pound (ein Pfund) of something when they want (exactly) 500?grams.\\r\\nThe metric system became compulsory on January 1, 1872, in Germany and on January 1, 1876, in Austria.[1]\\r\\nSome obsolete German units have names similar to units that were traditionally used in other countries, and that are still used in the United Kingdom (imperial units) and the United States (United States customary units).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the introduction of the metric system in German, almost every town had its own definitions of the units shown below. Often towns posted local definitions on a wall of the city hall. For example, the front wall of the old city hall of Rudolst?dt (still standing) has two marks which show the \\"Rudolst?dter Elle\\", the proper length of the Elle in that city. Supposedly by 1810, in Baden alone, there were 112 different standards for the Elle around Germany.[citation needed]\\r\\nA German geographic mile (geographische Meile) is defined as ?1?15 equatorial degrees, equal to 7,420.54?m (24,345.6?ft). A common German mile, land mile, or post mile (Gemeine deutsche Meile, Landmeile, Postmeile) was defined in various ways at different places and different times. After the introduction of the metric system in the 19th century, the Landmeile was generally fixed at 7,500?m (24,606?ft) (the Reichsmeile), but before then there were many local and regional variants (of which some are shown below):\\r\\nThe Rute or Ruthe is of Carolingian origin,[citation needed] and was used as a land measure. Many different kinds of Ruthe were used at various times in various parts of the German-speaking world. They were subdivided into differing numbers of local Fu?, and were of many different lengths. One source from 1830[2] lists the following:\\r\\nOne hour's travel, used up to the 19th century. In Germany ?1?2?Meile or 3.71?km (2.31?mi).

Actual volumes so measured, however, varied from one state or even one city to another. Within Saxony, for example, the \\"Dresden jar\\" held approximately 1 US quart or 0.95 litres or 0.83 imperial quarts, so a n?sel in Dresden was about 1 US pint (0.47?L; 0.83?imp?pt). The full volume of a \\"Leipzig jar\\" measured 1.2 liters (1.3?U.S.?qt; 1.1?imp?qt); the Leipzig n?sel was therefore 0.6 liters (0.63?U.S.?qt; 0.53?imp?qt).\\r\\nThe n?sel was used in minor commerce, as well as in the household to measure meal, grain, and such. These units of measure were officially valid in Saxony until 1868, when the metric system was introduced. Nevertheless, the old measures have continued in private use for decades.\\r\\nOne interesting modification was introduced in Thuringia. There, the n?sel was, by extension, also a measure of area; namely, the area of land which could be sown with one n?sel of seed  or about 19.36 square yards (16.19?m2; 0.00400 acres)","input":"What unit of measurement is used in germany?"},{"output":"bitter kola","context":"Garcinia kola (bitter kola, a name sometimes also used for G. afzelii) is a species of flowering plant in the Clusiaceae or Guttiferae family. It is found in Benin, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.\\r\\nThe fruit, seeds, nuts and bark of the plant have been used for centuries in folk medicine to treat ailments from coughs to fever. According to a report from the Center For International Forestry Research, Garcinia kola trade is still important to the tribes and villages in Nigeria.\\r\\nGarcinia kola is traditionally used by African medicine men who believe that it has purgative, antiparasitic, and antimicrobial properties.[2] The seeds are used for bronchitis, throat infections, colic, head or chest colds, and cough.[2] It is also used for liver disorders and as a chewing stick.[2]\\r\\nDespite the socio-economic importance of Garcinia kola, cultivation of the species is limited. Factors that have discouraged farmers from growing Garcinia kola include difficulties in germination that reduces seedling availability. Most productive trees were left in the wild when farmers cut plots out of the forest (Adebisi, 2004). Researchers have studied the germination problems of G. kola seeds and suggested various means of breaking its dormancy (Gyimah, 2000, Anegbeh et al., 2006, Kanmegne and Ndoumou, 2007, Oboho and Urughu, 2010, Oboho and Ogana, 2011). However, there is still a need to investigate simple and practicable methods that farmers could easily adopt with low technological input. G. kola seeds has both seeds coat dormancy and physiological dormancy probably imposed by the chemicals in the seed (Oboho and Urughu 2010). Seed coat dormancy of Garcinia kola can be reduced by removing the seed coat before sowing, while physiological dormancy can be reduced by soaking in water for 72 hours (Yakubu et al., 2014). Removal of the seed coat, soaking in water for 72 hours, placing inside air tight transparent polythene bag and sprinkling of water on the seeds when needed for constant moisture gives an early germination period of two weeks (Yakubu et al., 2014).","input":"What is the common name of garcinia cola?"},{"output":"between six and 48 hours after the bite","context":"Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus[1] of the subfamily Crotalinae (the pit vipers). The scientific name Crotalus is derived from the Greek ?ϫ, meaning \\"castanet\\".[2] The name Sistrurus is the Latinized form of the Greek word for \\"tail rattler\\" (ҷ??, seistrouros) and shares its root with the ancient Egyptian musical instrument the sistrum, a type of rattle.[3] The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies,[4] all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta and Saskatchewan and southern British Columbia in Canada to central Argentina.\\r\\nRattlesnakes are predators that live in a wide array of habitats, hunting small animals such as birds and rodents.\\r\\nRattlesnakes receive their name from the rattle located at the end of their tails, which makes a loud rattling noise when vibrated that deters predators or serves as a warning to passers-by.[5] However, rattlesnakes fall prey to hawks, weasels, king snakes, and a variety of other species. Rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon as neonates, while they are still weak and immature. Large numbers of rattlesnakes are killed by humans. Rattlesnake populations in many areas are severely threatened by habitat destruction, poaching, and extermination campaigns.\\r\\nRattlesnakes are the leading contributor to snakebite injuries in North America. However, rattlesnakes rarely bite unless provoked or threatened; if treated promptly, the bites are seldom fatal.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes are native to the Americas, living in diverse habitats from southwestern Canada to central Argentina. The large majority of species lives in the American Southwest and Mexico. Four species may be found east of the Mississippi River, and two in South America. In the United States, the states with the most types of rattlesnakes are Texas and Arizona.\\r\\nRattlesnakes are found in almost every type of habitat capable of supporting terrestrial ectothermic vertebrates, but individual species can have extremely specific habitat requirements, only able to live within certain plant associations in a narrow range of altitudes. Most species live near open, rocky areas. Rocks offer them cover from predators, plentiful prey (e.g. rodents, lizards, insects, etc. that live amidst the rocks), and open basking areas. However, rattlesnakes can also be found in a wide variety of other habitats including prairies, marshes, deserts, and forests.[6] Rattlesnakes prefer a temperature range between 80 and 90F (26 and 32C), but can survive temperatures below freezing, recovering from brief exposure to temperatures as low as 4F (?16C), and surviving for several days in temperatures as low as 37F (3C).[7]\\r\\nThe most probable ancestral area of rattlesnakes is the Sierra Madre Occidental region in Mexico. The most probable vegetation or habitat of the ancestral area appears to be pine-oak forests.[8] Feeding habits play an important ecological role by limiting the size of rodent populations, which prevents crop damage and stabilizes ecosystems.[9]\\r\\nRattlesnakes consume mice, rats, small birds, and other small animals.[10] They lie in wait for their prey, or hunt for it in holes.[11] The prey is killed quickly with a venomous bite as opposed to constriction. If the bitten prey moves away before dying, the rattlesnake can follow it by its scent.[12][13] When it locates the fallen prey, it checks for signs of life by prodding with its snout, flicking its tongue, and using its sense of smell. Once the prey has become incapacitated, the rattlesnake locates its head by odors emitted from the mouth. The prey is then ingested head-first, which allows wings and limbs to fold at the joints in a manner which minimizes the girth of the meal.[14] The gastric fluids of rattlesnakes are extremely powerful, allowing for the digestion of flesh, as well as bone. Optimal digestion occurs when the snake maintains a body temperature between 80 and 85?F (25 and 29?C). If the prey is small, the rattlesnake often continues hunting. If it was an adequate meal, the snake finds a warm, safe location in which to coil up and rest until the prey is digested.[15]\\r\\nRattlesnakes are believed to require at least their own body weight in water annually to remain hydrated. The method in which they drink depends on the water source. In larger bodies of water (streams, ponds, etc.), they submerge their heads and ingest water by opening and closing their jaws, which sucks in water. If drinking dew, or drinking from small puddles, they sip the liquid either by capillary action or by flattening and flooding their lower jaws.[16]\\r\\nNewborn rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon by a variety of species, including ravens, crows, roadrunners, raccoons, opossums, skunks, coyotes, weasels, whipsnakes, kingsnakes, and racers. Neonates of the smaller crotaline species are frequently killed and eaten by small predatory birds such as jays, kingfishers, and shrikes. Some species of ants in the genus Formica are known to prey upon neonates, and Solenopsis invicta (fire ants) likely do, as well. On occasion, hungry adult rattlesnakes cannibalize neonates. The small proportion (often as few as 20%) of rattlesnakes that make it to their second year are heavily preyed upon by a variety of larger predators including coyotes, eagles, hawks, owls, falcons, feral pigs, badgers, indigo snakes, and kingsnakes.[17]\\r\\nThe common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula), a constrictor, is immune to the venom of rattlesnakes and other vipers, and rattlesnakes form part of its natural diet. Rattlesnakes sense kingsnakes' presence by their odor.[18] When they realize a kingsnake is nearby, they begin enacting a set of defensive postures known as \\"body bridging\\". Unlike its normal erect and coiled defensive-striking posture, the rattlesnake keeps its head low to the ground in an attempt to prevent the kingsnake from gaining a hold on it (the head being the first part of the rattlesnake to be ingested). The rattlesnake jerks its body about, while bridging its back upwards, forming an elevated coil which faces the kingsnake. The elevated coil is used to strike the attacker, and is also used to shield the head from the kingsnake.[19]\\r\\nLike all pit vipers, rattlesnakes have two organs that can sense radiation: their eyes, and a set of heat-sensing \\"pits\\" on their faces that enable them to locate prey and move towards it, based on the prey's thermal radiation signature. These pits have a relatively short effective range of about 1?ft, but give the rattlesnake a distinctive advantage in hunting for warm-blooded creatures at night.[20][21]\\r\\nAside from this pair of simple eyes, rattlesnakes are able to detect thermal radiation emitted by warm-blooded organisms in their environment. Functioning optically like a pinhole camera eye, thermal radiation, in the form of infrared wavelength light, enters, passes through the opening of the pit and strikes the pit membrane located in the back wall, warming this part of the organ. Due to the extremely high density of these heat-sensitive receptors innervating this membrane, the rattlesnake can detect temperature changes of 0.003?C or less in its immediate surroundings. Infrared cues from these receptors are transmitted to the brain by the trigeminal nerve, where they are used to create thermal maps of the snakes surroundings. Due to the small sizes of the pit openings, typically these thermals images are low in resolution and contrast. Nevertheless, rattlesnakes superimpose visual images created from information from the eyes with these thermal images from the pit organs to more accurately visualize their surroundings in low levels of light. Research conducted recently on the molecular mechanism of this ability suggests the temperature sensitivity of these pit organs is closely linked to the activity of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1, a temperature-sensitive ion channel saturated in the pit membrane.\\r\\nRattlesnake eyes, which contain a large number of rod cells, are well adapted to nocturnal use.[22][23] However, rattlesnakes are not exclusively nocturnal, and their vision is more acute during daylight conditions.[23] Rattlesnakes also possess cone cells, which means they are capable of some form of color vision. The rattlesnake eye lacks a fovea, making it impossible for them to see sharply defined images. Instead, they mostly rely on the perception of movement.[22] Rattlesnake eyes are capable of horizontal rotation, but they do not appear to move their eyeballs to follow moving objects.[24]\\r\\nRattlesnakes have an exceptionally keen sense of smell. They can sense olfactory stimuli both through their nostrils and by flicking their tongues, which carry scent-bearing particles to the Jacobson's organs in the roof of their mouths.[25][26]\\r\\nLike all snakes, rattlesnakes lack external ear openings, and the structures of their middle ear are not as highly specialized as those of other vertebrates, such as mammals. Thus, their sense of hearing is not very effective, but they are capable of sensing vibrations in the ground, passed by the skeleton to the auditory nerve.[22]\\r\\nRattlesnake fangs are connected by venom ducts to large venom glands near the outer edge of the upper jaw, towards the rear of the head. When the rattlesnake bites, muscles on the sides of the venom glands contract, which squeezes the venom through the ducts and into the fangs. When the fangs are not in use, they remain folded against the palate.[27][28]\\r\\nRattlesnakes are born with fully functioning fangs and venom, and are capable of killing prey at birth.[17][29] Adult rattlesnakes shed their fangs every 6ÿ10 weeks. At least three pairs of replacement fangs lie behind the functional pair.[30]\\r\\nThe venom is hemotoxic, destroying tissue, causing necrosis and coagulopathy (disrupted blood clotting).[31] In the U.S., the tiger rattlesnake (C. tigris) and some varieties of the Mojave rattlesnake (C. scutulatus) also have a presynaptic neurotoxic venom component known as Mojave type A toxin, which can cause severe paralysis.[31][32][33] Although it has a comparatively low venom yield,[34] the venom toxicity of C. tigris is considered to be among the highest of all rattlesnake venoms, and among the highest of all snakes in the Western Hemisphere based on LD50 studies conducted on laboratory mice. C. scutulatus is also widely regarded as producing one of the most toxic snake venoms in the Americas, based on LD50 studies in laboratory mice.[35]\\r\\nRattlesnake venom is a mixture of five to 15 enzymes, various metal ions, biogenic amines, lipids, free amino acids, proteins, and polypeptides. It contains components designed to immobilize and disable the prey, as well as digestive enzymes which break down tissue to prepare for later ingestion.[26][30] The venom is very stable, and retains its toxicity for many years in storage.[26]\\r\\nOlder snakes possess more potent venom, and larger snakes are frequently capable of storing larger volumes of it.[36]\\r\\nAccording to Rubio, \\"The most widely accepted hypothesis for the evolution of the rattle is that the rattle is a warning device for predatory animals that might be a threat to the rattlesnake. It produces a signal to drive them away.\\"[37]\\r\\nThe rattle is composed of a series of hollow, interlocked segments made of keratin, which are created by modifying the scales that cover the tip of the tail. The contraction of special \\"shaker\\" muscles in the tail causes these segments to vibrate against one another, making the rattling noise (which is amplified because the segments are hollow) in a behavior known as tail vibration.[1][38][39] The muscles that cause the rattle to shake are some of the fastest known, firing 50 times per second on average, sustained for up to three hours.[40]\\r\\nAt birth, a prebutton is present at the tip of the snake's tail; it is replaced by the button several days later when the first skin is shed. However, no sound can be made by the rattle until a second segment is added when the skin is shed again.[41] A new rattle segment is added each time the snake sheds its skin, and the snake may shed its skin several times a year, depending on food supply and growth rate.\\r\\nRattlesnakes travel with their rattles held up to protect them from damage, but in spite of this precaution, their day-to-day activities in the wild still cause them to regularly break off end segments. Because of this, the age of a rattlesnake is not related to the number of rattles on its tail.[1][39][40]\\r\\nOne of the differentiating features of males and females is the males have thicker and longer tails (because they contain the inverted hemipenes). Also, the tails of males taper gradually from the body, whereas the tails of females narrow abruptly at the vent.[42]\\r\\nRattlesnake skin has a set of overlapping scales which cover the entire body, providing protection from a variety of threats including dehydration and physical trauma.[43] The typical rattlesnake, genus Crotalus, has the top of its head covered with small scales, except, with a few species, a few crowded plates directly over the snout.[44] The skin of snakes is highly sensitive to contact, tension, and pressure; they are capable of feeling pain.[45]\\r\\nAn important function of the skin is the sensation of changes in air temperature, which can guide the snakes towards warm basking/shelter locations.[46] All snakes are ectotherms. To maintain a stable body temperature, they exchange heat with their external environments. Snakes often move into open, sunny areas to absorb heat from the sun and warmed earth, a behavior known as basking. Nerves in the skin regulate the flow of blood into the veins near the surface. Rubio states, \\"The skin's acceptance of radiant energy, its ability to determine the temperature, and the snake's ability to move toward or away from one temperature gradient to another are among the most important behavioral actions in its daily life.\\"[45]\\r\\nThe skin of rattlesnakes is intricately patterned in a manner that camouflages them from their predators.[46][47] Rattlesnakes do not generally have bright or showy colors (reds, yellows, blues, etc.), instead relying on subtle earth tones that resemble the surrounding environment.[48]\\r\\nCreases in the epidermal tissue connect the scales of rattlesnakes. When ingesting large prey, these creases can unfold, allowing the skin to expand to envelop a much greater volume. The skin appears to tightly stretch to accommodate the meal, but in reality, the skin is simply smoothing out from its creased state and is not under very high tension.[49]\\r\\nMost rattlesnake species mate during the summer or fall, while some species mate only in the spring, or during both the spring and fall.[50]\\r\\nFemales secrete small amounts of sex pheromones, which leave a trail the males follow using their tongues and Jacobson's organs as guides.[50] Once a receptive female has been located, the male often spends several days following her around (a behavior not common outside of the mating season), frequently touching and rubbing her in an attempt to stimulate her.[51][52]\\r\\nThe males of some species, such as timber rattlesnakes (C. horridus), fight each other during the mating season, in competition over females. These fights known as \\"combat dances\\" consist of the two males intertwining the anterior portion of their bodies, often with their heads and necks held vertically. The larger males usually end up driving the smaller males away.[53][54]\\r\\nAlthough many kinds of snakes and other reptiles are oviparous (lay eggs), rattlesnakes are ovoviviparous (give birth to live young after carrying eggs inside).[55] The female produces the ova (\\"eggs\\") in her ovaries, after which they pass through the body cavity and into one of her two oviducts. The ova are arranged in a continuous chain in a coiled section of the oviduct, known as the \\"tuba\\".[51] Male rattlesnakes have sexual organs known as hemipenes, located in the base of the tail. The hemipenis is retracted inside of the body when mating is not occurring. Females can store semen for months in internal recesses known as spermathecae, which permits them to mate during the fall, but not fertilize the ova until the following spring.[51] The Arizona black rattlesnake (C. oreganus cerberus), has been observed to exhibit complex social behavior reminiscent of that in mammals. Females often remain with their young in nests for several weeks, and mothers have been observed cooperatively parenting their broods.[56]\\r\\nRattlesnakes generally take several years to mature, and females usually reproduce only once every three years.[57]\\r\\nIn the colder winter months, some rattlesnake species enter a period of brumation, which is dormancy similar to hibernation. They often gather together for brumation in large numbers (sometimes over 1,000 snakes), huddling together inside underground \\"rattlesnake dens\\" or hibernacula.[58][59] Rattlesnakes regularly share their winter burrows with a wide variety of other species (such as turtles, small mammals, invertebrates, and other types of snakes).[58]\\r\\nRattlesnakes often return to the same den, year after year, sometimes traveling several miles to get there. It is not known exactly how the rattlesnakes find their way back to the dens each year, but may use a combination of pheromone trails and visual cues (e.g. topography, celestial navigation, and solar orientation).[60]\\r\\nSpecies with long periods of brumation tend to have much lower reproductive rates than those with shorter brumation periods, or those that do not brumate all. Female timber rattlesnakes in high peaks in the Appalachian Mountains of New England reproduce every three years on average; the lance-headed rattlesnake (C. polystictus), native to the warm climate of Mexico, reproduces annually.[61]\\r\\nLike most other snakes, rattlesnakes aestivate during very hot or dry periods, which is why they are rarely seen during the hottest and driest months of summer.[62]\\r\\nRattlesnakes tend to avoid developed areas, preferring undisturbed, natural habitats. Rapid habitat destruction by humans, mass killings during events such as rattlesnake round-ups, and deliberate extermination campaigns all pose threats to rattlesnake populations in many areas. Several species of rattlesnakes, such as the timber rattlesnake, massasauga, and canebrake rattlesnake, are listed as threatened or endangered in many U.S. states.[63]\\r\\nA large number of rattlesnakes die from being run over by cars.[17]\\r\\nIn more heavily populated and trafficked areas, reports have been increasing of rattlesnakes that do not rattle. This phenomenon is commonly attributed to selective pressure by humans, who often kill the snakes when they are discovered.[64] Non-rattling snakes are more likely to go unnoticed, so survive to reproduce offspring that, like themselves, are less likely to rattle.\\r\\nRattlesnakes are the leading cause of snakebite injuries in North America and a significant cause in Central and South America.[33][65]\\r\\nRattlesnakes tend to avoid wide-open spaces where they cannot hide from predators, and generally avoid humans if they are aware of their approach.[66] Rattlesnakes rarely bite unless they feel threatened or provoked. A majority of victims (about 72%[67]) are males, often young and intoxicated. Around half of bites occur in cases where the victim saw the snake, yet made no effort to move away.[26]\\r\\nCaution is advised even when snakes are believed to be dead; rattlesnake heads can see, flick the tongue, and inflict venomous bites for up to an hour after being severed from the body.[68][69]\\r\\nAn estimated 7,000 to 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States each year, with about five deaths.[70] The most important factor in survival following a severe envenomation is the time elapsed between the bite and treatment. Most deaths occur between six and 48 hours after the bite. If antivenom treatment is given within two hours of the bite, the probability of recovery is greater than 99%.[71]\\r\\nWhen a bite occurs, the amount of venom injected is under voluntary control by the snake. The amount released depends on a variety of factors, including the condition of the snake (e.g. having long, healthy fangs and a full venom sack) and its temperament (an angry, hungry snake that has just been stepped on vs. a satiated snake that was merely surprised by walking near it).[72] About 20% of bites result in no envenomation at all. A lack of burning pain and edema 3?8?in (1?cm) away from the fang marks after one hour suggests either no or minimal envenomation occurred. A lack of edema or erythema in the area of the bite after eight hours indicates a lack of envenomation for most rattlesnake bites.[73]\\r\\nCommon symptoms include swelling, severe pain, tingling, weakness, anxiety, nausea and vomiting, hemorrhaging, perspiration, and eventually heart failure.[72][74] Local pain following envenomation is often intense, increasing with the ensuing edema.[72] Children generally experience more severe symptoms because they receive a larger amount of venom per unit of body mass.[73]\\r\\nAntivenin, often referred to as antivenom, is commonly used to treat the effects of local and systemic pit viper envenomations.[75] The first step in the production of crotaline antivenin is collecting (\\"milking\\") the venom of a live rattlesnakeusually from the western diamondback (Crotalus atrox), eastern diamondback (Crotalus adamanteus), South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissis terrificus), or fer-de-lance (Bothrops atrox). The extracted venom is then diluted and injected into horses, goats, or sheep, whose immune systems produce antibodies that protect from the toxic effects of the venom. These antibodies accumulate in the blood, which is then extracted and centrifuged to separate the red blood cells. The resulting serum is purified into a lyophilized powder, which is packaged for distribution and later use by human patients.[76][77]\\r\\nBecause antivenin is derived from animal antibodies, people generally display an allergic response during infusion, known as serum sickness.[78][79]\\r\\nIn the United States, more than 15,000 domesticated animals are bitten by snakes each year. Rattlesnake envenomations account for 80% of the deadly incidents.[80]\\r\\nDogs are most commonly bitten on the front legs and head. Horses generally receive bites on the muzzle, and cattle on their tongues and muzzles. If a domesticated animal is bitten, the hair around the bite should be removed, so the wound can be clearly seen. The crotaline Fab antivenin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of canine rattlesnake bites. Symptoms include swelling, slight bleeding, sensitivity, shaking, and anxiety.[36]\\r\\nAztec paintings, Central American temples, and the great burial mounds in the southeastern United States are frequently adorned with depictions of rattlesnakes, often within the symbols and emblems of the most powerful deities.[81]\\r\\nThe Feathered Serpent of Mesoamerican religion was depicted as having the combined features of the quetzal and rattlesnake.[82] The Ancient Maya considered the rattlesnake to be a \\"vision serpent\\" that acted as a conduit to the \\"otherworld\\".[83]\\r\\nRattlesnakes are a key element in Aztec mythology and were widely represented in Aztec art, including sculptures, jewelry, and architectural elements.\\r\\nMembers of some Christian sects in the southern United States are regularly bitten while participating in \\"snake handling\\" rituals. Snake handling is when people hold venomous snakes, unprotected, as part of a religious service inspired by a literal interpretation of the Bible verses Mark 16:17-18 which reads, \\"In my name ... they will pick up snakes with their hands\\".[26][84]\\r\\nJournalist Alistair Cooke claimed that rattlesnake tastes \\"just like chicken, only tougher\\".[85] Others have compared the flavor to a wide range of other meats, including veal, frog, tortoise, quail, fish, rabbit, and even canned tuna.[86] Methods of preparation include barbecueing[87] and frying; author Maud Newton, following a recipe by Harry Crews, described the taste, \\"at least when breaded and fried, like a sinewy, half-starved tilapia.\\"[88]\\r\\nThe rattlesnake became a symbolic animal for the Colonials during the Revolutionary War period, and is depicted prominently on the Gadsden Flag. It continues to be used as a symbol by the United States military, and political movements within the United States.","input":"How fast do you die from a rattlesnake bite?"},{"output":"French foreign minister Robert Schuman","context":"The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was an organisation of 6 European countries set up after World War II to regulate their industrial production under a centralised authority. It was formally established in 1951 by the Treaty of Paris, signed by Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The ECSC was the first international organisation to be based on the principles of supranationalism,[2] and started the process of formal integration which ultimately led to the European Union.\\r\\nThe ECSC was first proposed by French foreign minister Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950 as a way to prevent further war between France and Germany. He declared his aim was to \\"make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible\\"[3] which was to be achieved by regional integration, of which the ECSC was the first step. The Treaty would create a common market for coal and steel among its member states which served to neutralise competition between European nations over natural resources, particularly in the Ruhr.\\r\\nThe ECSC was run by four institutions: a High Authority composed of independent appointees, a Common Assembly composed of national parliamentarians, a Special Council composed of nation ministers, and a Court of Justice. These would ultimately form the blueprint for today's European Commission, European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Court of Justice.\\r\\nThe ECSC stood model for the communities set up after it by the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community, with whom it shared its membership and some institutions. The 1967 Merger (Brussels) Treaty led to all of ECSC's institutions to merge into that of the European Economic Community, but the ECSC retained its own independent legal personality. In 2002, the Treaty of Paris expired and the ECSC ceased to exist in any form, its activities fully absorbed by the European Community under the framework of Amsterdam and Nice treaties.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Schuman was instrumental in turning French policy away from the Gaullist policy of permanent occupation or control of parts of German territory such as the Ruhr or the Saar. Despite stiff ultra-nationalist, Gaullist and communist opposition, the French Assembly voted a number of resolutions in favour of his new policy of integrating Germany into a community. The International Authority for the Ruhr changed in consequence. Schuman's guiding principles were moral, based on the equality of states (international democracy), not the power politics of domination.\\r\\nThe Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950 (later known as Europe Day) occurred after two Cabinet meetings, when the proposal became French government policy. France was thus the first government to agree to surrender sovereignty in a supranational Community. That decision was based on a text, written and edited by Schuman's friend and colleague, the Foreign Ministry lawyer, professor Paul Reuter with the assistance of economist Jean Monnet and Schuman's Directeur de Cabinet, Bernard Clappier. It laid out a plan for a European Community to pool the coal and steel of its members in a common market.\\r\\nSchuman proposed that \\"Franco-German production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common High Authority, within the framework of an organisation open to the participation of the other countries of Europe\\". Such an act was intended to help economic growth and cement peace between France and Germany, who were historic enemies. Coal and steel were vital resources needed for a country to wage war, so pooling those resources between two such enemies was seen as more than symbolic.[2][4] Schuman saw the decision of the French government on his proposal as the first example of a democratic and supranational Community, a new development in world history.[5][6] The plan was also seen by some, like Monnet, who crossed out Reuter's mention of \\"supranational\\" in the draft and inserted \\"federation\\", as a first step to a \\"European federation\\".[2][4]\\r\\nThe Schuman Declaration that created the ECSC had several distinct aims:\\r\\nFirstly, it was intended to prevent further war between France and Germany and other states[8] by tackling the root cause of war.[8] The ECSC was primarily conceived with France and Germany in mind: \\"The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany. Any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries.\\"[8] The coal and steel industries being essential for the production of munitions, Schuman believed that by uniting these two industries across France and Germany under an innovative supranational system that also included a European anti-cartel agency, he could \\"make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible\\".[9] Schuman had another aim: \\"With increased resources Europe will be able to pursue the achievement of one of its essential tasks, namely, the development of the African continent.\\"[8] Industrial cartels tended to impose \\"restrictive practices\\"[8] on national markets, whereas the ECSC would ensure the increased production necessary for their ambitions in Africa.\\r\\nIn West Germany, Schuman kept the closest contacts with the new generation of democratic politicians. Karl Arnold, the Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia, the state that included the coal and steel producing Ruhr, was initially spokesman for German foreign affairs. He gave a number of speeches and broadcasts on a supranational coal and steel community at the same time as Robert Schuman began to propose this Community in 1948 and 1949. The Social Democratic Party of Germany (German: Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, SPD), in spite of support from unions and other socialists in Europe, decided it would oppose the Schuman plan. Kurt Schumacher's personal distrust of France, capitalism, and Konrad Adenauer aside, he claimed that a focus on integrating with a \\"Little Europe of the Six\\" would override the SPD's prime objective of German reunification and thus empower ultra-nationalist and Communist movements in democratic countries. He also thought the ECSC would end any hopes of nationalising the steel industry and lock in a Europe of \\"cartels, clerics and conservatives\\".[10] Younger members of the party like Carlo Schmid, were, however, in favor of the Community and pointed to the long socialist support for the supranational idea.\\r\\nIn France, Schuman had gained strong political and intellectual support from all sections of the nation and many non-communist parties. Notable amongst these were ministerial colleague Andre Philip, president of the Foreign Relations Committee Edouard Bonnefous, and former prime minister, Paul Reynaud. Projects for a coal and steel authority and other supranational communities were formulated in specialist subcommittees of the Council of Europe in the period before it became French government policy. Charles de Gaulle, who was then out of power, had been an early supporter of \\"linkages\\" between economies, on French terms, and had spoken in 1945 of a \\"European confederation\\" that would exploit the resources of the Ruhr. However, he opposed the ECSC as a faux (false) pooling (\\"le pool, ce faux semblant\\") because he considered it an unsatisfactory \\"piecemeal approach\\" to European unity and because he considered the French government \\"too weak\\" to dominate the ECSC as he thought proper.[11] De Gaulle also felt that the ECSC had insufficient supranational authority because the Assembly was not ratified by a European referendum and he did not accept Raymond Aron's contention that the ECSC was intended as a movement away from United States domination. Consequently, de Gaulle and his followers in the RPF voted against ratification in the lower house of the French Parliament.[11]\\r\\nDespite these attacks and those from the extreme left, the ECSC found substantial public support, and so it was established. It gained strong majority votes in all eleven chambers of the parliaments of the Six, as well as approval among associations and European public opinion. In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in their opposition. The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion and gave the Community idea positive support.\\r\\nThe 100-article Treaty of Paris, which established the ECSC, was signed on 18 April 1951 by \\"the inner six\\": France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (Benelux). The ECSC was the first international organisation to be based on supranational principles[2] and was, through the establishment of a common market for coal and steel, intended to expand the economies, increase employment, and raise the standard of living within the Community. The market was also intended to progressively rationalise the distribution of high level production whilst ensuring stability and employment. The common market for coal was opened on 10 February 1953, and for steel on 1 May 1953.[12] Upon taking effect, the ECSC gradually replaced the International Authority for the Ruhr.[13]\\r\\nOn 11 August 1952, the United States was the first non-ECSC member to recognise the Community and stated it would now deal with the ECSC on coal and steel matters, establishing its delegation in Brussels. Monnet responded by choosing Washington, D.C. as the site of the ECSC's first external presence. The headline of the delegation's first bulletin read \\"Towards a Federal Government of Europe\\".[14]\\r\\nSix years after the Treaty of Paris, the Treaties of Rome were signed by the six ECSC members, creating the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom). These Communities were based, with some adjustments, on the ECSC. The Treaties of Rome were to be in force indefinitely, unlike the Treaty of Paris, which was to expire after fifty years. These two new Communities worked on the creation of a customs union and nuclear power community respectively.[2] The Rome treaties were hurried through just before de Gaulle was given emergency powers and proclaimed the Fifth Republic.[citation needed] Despite his efforts to \\"chloroform\\" the Communities, their fields rapidly expanded and the EEC became the most important tool for political unification, overshadowing the ECSC.[2]\\r\\nDespite being separate legal entities, the ECSC, EEC and Euratom initially shared the Common Assembly and the European Court of Justice, although the Councils and the High Authority/Commissions remained separate. To avoid duplication, the Merger Treaty merged these separate bodies of the ECSC and Euratom with the EEC. The EEC later became one of the three pillars of the present day European Union.[2]\\r\\nThe Treaty of Paris was frequently amended as the EC and EU evolved and expanded. With the treaty due to expire in 2002, debate began at the beginning of the 1990s on what to do with it. It was eventually decided that it should be left to expire. The areas covered by the ECSC's treaty were transferred to the Treaty of Rome and the financial loose ends and the ECSC research fund were dealt with via a protocol of the Treaty of Nice. The treaty finally expired on 23 July 2002.[4] That day, the ECSC flag was lowered for the final time outside the European Commission in Brussels and replaced with the EU flag.[15]\\r\\nThe institutions of the ECSC were the High Authority, the Common Assembly, the Special Council of Ministers and the Court of Justice. A Consultative Committee was established alongside the High Authority, as a fifth institution representing civil society. This was the first international representation of consumers in history. These institutions were merged in 1967 with those of the European Community, which then governed the ECSC,[12] except for the Committee, which continued to be independent until the expiration of the Treaty of Paris in 2002.[16]\\r\\nThe Treaty stated that the location of the institutions would be decided by common accord of the members, yet the issue was hotly contested. As a temporary compromise, the institutions were provisionally located in the City of Luxembourg, despite the Assembly being based in Strasbourg.[17]\\r\\nThe High Authority (the predecessor to the European Commission) was a nine-member executive body which governed the Community. The Authority consisted of nine members in office for a term of six years. Eight of these members were appointed by the governments of the six signatories.[18] These eight members then themselves appointed a ninth person to be President of the High Authority.[12]\\r\\nDespite being appointed by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to pledge not to represent their national interest, but rather took an oath to defend the general interests of the Community as a whole. Their independence was aided by members being barred from having any occupation outside the Authority or having any business interests (paid or unpaid) during their tenure and for three years after they left office.[12] To further ensure impartiality, one third of the membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).\\r\\nThe Authority's principal innovation was its supranational character. It had a broad area of competence to ensure the objectives of the treaty were met and that the common market functioned smoothly. The High Authority could issue three types of legal instruments: Decisions, which were entirely binding laws; Recommendations, which had binding aims but the methods were left to member states; and Opinions, which had no legal force.[12]\\r\\nUp to the merger in 1967, the authority had five Presidents followed by an interim President serving for the final days.[19]\\r\\nThe Common Assembly (which later became the European Parliament) was composed of 78 representatives and exercised supervisory powers over the executive High Authority. The Common Assembly representatives were to be national MPs delegated each year by their Parliaments to the Assembly or directly elected \\"by universal suffrage\\" (article 21), though in practice it was the former, as there was no requirement for elections until the Treaties of Rome and no actual election until 1979, as Rome required agreement in the Council on the electoral system first. However, to emphasise that the chamber was not a traditional international organisation composed of representatives of national governments, the Treaty of Paris used the term \\"representatives of the peoples\\".[12] The Assembly was not originally specified in the Schuman Plan because it was hoped the Community would use the institutions (Assembly, Court) of the Council of Europe. When this became impossible because of British objections, separate institutions had to be created. The Assembly was intended as a democratic counter-weight and check to the High Authority, to advise but also to have power to sack the Authority for incompetence, injustice, corruption or fraud. The first President (akin to a Speaker) was Paul-Henri Spaak.[20]\\r\\nThe Special Council of Ministers (equivalent to the current Council of the European Union) was composed of representatives of national governments. The Presidency was held by each state for a period of three months, rotating between them in alphabetical order. One of its key aspects was the harmonisation of the work of the High Authority and that of national governments, which were still responsible for the state's general economic policies. The Council was also required to issue opinions on certain areas of work of the High Authority.[12] Issues relating only to coal and steel were in the exclusive domain of the High Authority, and in these areas the Council (unlike the modern Council) could only act as a scrutiny on the Authority. However, areas outside coal and steel required the consent of the Council.[21]\\r\\nThe Court of Justice was to ensure the observation of ECSC law along with the interpretation and application of the Treaty. The Court was composed of seven judges, appointed by common accord of the national governments for six years. There were no requirements that the judges had to be of a certain nationality, simply that they be qualified and that their independence be beyond doubt. The Court was assisted by two Advocates General.[12]\\r\\nThe Consultative Committee (similar to the Economic and Social Committee) had between 30 and 50 members equally divided between producers, workers, consumers and dealers in the coal and steel sector. Again, there were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Membership were appointed for two years and were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Again, the required democratic procedures were not introduced and nomination of these members remained in the hands of national ministers. The High Authority was obliged to consult the Committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed.[12] The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and Social Committee (ESC). Despite its independence, the Committee did cooperate with the ESC when they were consulted on the same issue.[16]\\r\\nIts mission (article 2) was general: to \\"contribute to the expansion of the economy, the development of employment and the improvement of the standard of living\\" of its citizens. The Community had little effect on coal and steel production, which was influenced more by global trends. Trade between members did increase (tenfold for steel) which saved members' money by not having to import resources from the United States. The High Authority also issued 280 modernization loans to the industry which helped the industry to improve output and reduce costs. Costs were further reduced by the abolition of tariffs at borders.[22]\\r\\nAmong the ECSC's greatest achievements are those on welfare issues. Some mines, for example, were clearly unsustainable without government subsidies. Some miners had extremely poor housing. Over 15 years it financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers to buy a home they could not have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers who have lost their jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150?million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the coal and steel sector by some of its members.[22]\\r\\nFar more important than creating Europe's first social and regional policy, it is argued that the ECSC introduced European peace. It involved the continent's first European tax. This was a flat tax, a levy on production with a maximum rate of one percent. Given that the European Community countries are now experiencing the longest period of peace in more than seventy years,[23][citation needed] this has been described as the cheapest tax for peace in history. Another world war, or \\"world suicide\\" as Schuman called this threat in 1949, was avoided. In October 1953 Schuman said that the possibility of another European war had been eliminated. Reasoning had to prevail among member states.[citation needed]\\r\\nHowever the ECSC failed to achieve several fundamental aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel groups such as the Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition in a short period of time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.[22]","input":"Who proposed the european coal and steel community?"},{"output":"Marvel's Daredevil","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series are American superhero television shows based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics.

The series would be centered on Bernthal as Castle, and was described as a stand-alone series, outside of the series leading up to The Defenders.[175][176][177] Loeb implied that Marvel Television had not instigated the development of the spin-off and were focusing on making \\"the best 13 episodes of Daredevil season two\\" at the time, but did say, \\"I'm never going to discourage a network from looking at one of our characters and encouraging us to do more....If we are lucky enough that through the writing, through the direction, through the actor that people want to see more of that person, terrific.\\"[178] In April 2016, Marvel and Netflix ordered The Punisher, along with confirming Bernthal's involvement and naming Steve Lightfoot as showrunner.[87] Filming began in Brooklyn, New York in October 2016,[179] and concluded in April 2017.[180] A second season was ordered on December 12, 2017.[181]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first season, which was released on November 17, 2017,[182] Woll and Morgan reprise their roles as Karen Page and Turk Barrett, respectively.[183][184] The second season is scheduled to be released in 2019.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen six teenagers discover their parents are villains, they reluctantly unite to go against them.[185] In the second season, the teenagers are now on the run from their parents, living on their own and figuring out how to stop Pride, before learning there may be a mole among them.[187]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2016, Marvel announced Marvel's Runaways had received a pilot order, along with additional scripts, from the streaming service Hulu, based on the team of the same name.

Characters being considered for series included Loki and Scarlet Witch, with the actors who portrayed the characters in the films expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, with a \\"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio productions\\".

In the process, they have demonstrated that it's possible to deliver a credible superhero show without a lot of pyrotechnics\\".[311]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the release of the first season of Luke Cage, The Atlantic's David Sims wrote on the pacing issue of Marvel's Netflix series, a common complaint to that point, stating, \\"After two seasons of Daredevil, one of Jessica Jones, and now one of Luke Cage, the Netflix model feels fundamentally flawed, encouraging the kind of molasses-slow plotting comic books are designed to eschew. The problem isn't that these shows are bad, necessarily... But they all take far too long to get going, by which point many viewers will have already tuned out.\\" He felt one of the problems was the fact that Netflix does not rely on viewers tuning into a particular series as broadcast series do each week, but rather subscribers who, if they lose interest, \\"can take as long as they want to catch up... as long as they keep paying their subscription fee every month.\\" The Netflix series are also afforded the opportunity to explore elements in more detail, with Sims noting \\"A lot of this detail [is] good, but it could have been considerably compressednone of the Marvel Netflix series, so far, would have lost much by being squeezed into 10 episodes, or even 8. If Netflix shaved the 60-minute running time down quite a bit, it would likely inspire more economicaland betterstorytelling from its shows.\\" Sims concluded by saying, \\"What's most frustrating of all is that Netflix isn't getting rid of this approach anytime soon. Daredevil season three, Jessica Jones season two, Iron Fist, and The Punisher are all on their way, and each will follow the same 13-episode structure... The only respite may come in the form of The Defenders, a planned crossover series... over the course of just eight episodes. Who knows? The show might even surprise viewers and explain its villain's motivations within the first hour. Until then, fans will be stuck needlessly giving over entire days to these series, while others are deterred from watching at all.\\"[312] In her review for the first season of Iron Fist, Allison Keene of Collider spoke more on the pacing of Marvel's Netflix series, stating, \\"By focusing so intently on making these series... much more grounded in a gritty real world than what we typically expect from a superhero show (like DC's candy-colored [Arrowverse] on The CW), the problem is that they miss out on the key element: this should be fantastical entertainment.\\"[313] With The Defenders, Jeff Jansen of Entertainment Weekly felt many improvements were made to the general complaints the previous seasons received. He said, \\"The Defenders is far from perfect. But it's an enjoyable superhero adventure distinguished by improvements and innovations that I hope Marvel will carry forward. Shorter seasons. More team-ups. Fewer shows. Start the consolidation by letting go of Iron Fist. If Danny Rand must persist, add him to the other shows and let the stronger players carry him.\\"[314]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show follows the overworked, underpaid, clean up crew of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, who specialize in dealing with the aftermath of superhero conflicts, rescheduling events because of the conflicts, and retrieving lost items.[315]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2015, ABC ordered a put pilot for a half-hour live-action comedy series Marvel's Damage Control, based on the comics construction company of the same name. The series is being developed by Ben Karlin for ABC Studios and Marvel Television, with Karlin also writing the script for the project and serving as executive producer.[315][316] The series had previously been implied by then ABC Entertainment president Paul Lee to have begun airing as early as the 2016ÿ17 television season.[317]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarvel has been working with screenwriter John Ridley since mid-April 2015 to craft a new television series, \\"reinventing\\" an existing Marvel character or property.[318] In January 2016, Ridley confirmed that the project was \\"still in development\\". He stated that he was looking to \\"bring some of the socially conscious nature\\" of Jessica Jones and his series American Crime to the show, while also creating something that is \\"straight entertainment\\".[319] A year later, Channing Dungey revealed that Ridley's project was still progressing, with Ridley working on a rewrite of his script.[320] Ridley added that the rewrite was not because \\"anything didn't work the first time around\\", but rather trying to make sure the series does something viewers have not necessarily seen before in a superhero television series, hoping it would occupy \\"a space that is not currently being filled\\" by Marvel. He also stated that he hoped to create the series \\"in the near term.\\"[321] By August 2017, Dungey was \\"not sure\\" if Ridley was still working on the project.[322]\\r\\n\\r\\nDungey said in May 2016 that there were \\"a handful of projects in development\\", after passing on Most Wanted and canceling Agent Carter, and that Marvel and ABC were looking \\"at series that would be beneficial to both brands.\\"[323] In January 2018, she noted that Marvel and ABC \\"tried a few things that haven't worked out as well as we would've liked. We developed a couple things this season that we don't think are going to end up going forward, so we're going to look really carefully about what we do next, because the idea for us is to come up with something that works very well for both Marvel and ABC, so we're going to continue to try there.\\"[324] In August, Dungey said \\"we're cooking up a couple things for broadcast\\" in terms of potential new Marvel series on ABC, and that there was one idea in particular that she was excited to talk about.[325] In September 2018, ABC gave a production commitment to a series featuring lesser-known female superheroes, written and executive produced by Allan Heinberg. Jeph Loeb was also set to executive produce the potential series. The idea had been a \\"strong contender from the get-go\\" in terms of the new series that Marvel and ABC had been developing.[326]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2016, Lee announced that ABC Studios was developing a second comedy series with Marvel after Damage Control in hope it would air on ABC,[317] while Netflix CCO Ted Sarandos stated that \\"all the characters in the universe could also spin out\\" into their own series at some point.[177] Netflix vice president of original content Cindy Holland reiterated in July 2018 that there were always ongoing discussions regarding creating more spin-offs for characters in their Marvel series.[327] That September, Loeb said that if he was able to, he would create a Daughters of the Dragon series for Netflix featuring Jessica Henwick's Colleen Wing and Simone Missick's Misty Knight.[328]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy April 2015, Marvel was developing a spinoff series of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. The series, which was being developed by Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. executive producer Jeffrey Bell and writer Paul Zbyszewski, would be based on storylines occurring at the end of the second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and would receive its own pilot rather than a backdoor pilot.[329] Adrianne Palicki and Nick Blood entered into discussions to headline the potential new series as their characters Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter, respectively.[330] By May 7, 2015, when ABC announced their series renewals and cancellations, and new series pickups, the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. spinoff was passed on.[331]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2015, the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. spinoff series received new life as a reworked series, titled Marvel's Most Wanted, with a pilot order.[332] Bell and Zbyszewski once again developed the series, while also serving as co-writers of the pilot, executive producers, and showrunners, with Jeph Loeb also attached as executive producer.[333] The series would still focus on Morse and Hunter, with Palicki and Blood both attached, and was described as \\"a new take focusing on the same duo and their continuing adventures.\\"[332] In May 2016, the series was passed on by ABC once again.[334]","input":"What was the first marvel show on netflix?"},{"output":"four-year","context":"A term of office is the length of time a person serves in a particular elected office. In many jurisdictions there is a defined limit on how long terms of office may be before the officeholder must be subject to re-election. Some jurisdictions exercise term limits, setting a maximum number of terms an individual may hold in a particular office.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing the origin of the Westminster system, aspects of the United Kingdom's system of government are replicated in many other countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe monarch serves as head of state until his or her death or abdication.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons are elected for the duration of the parliament. Following dissolution of the Parliament, a general election is held which consists of simultaneous elections for all seats. For most MPs this means that their terms of office are identical to the duration of the Parliament, though an individual's term may be cut short by death or resignation. An MP elected in a by-election mid-way through a Parliament, regardless of how long they have occupied the seat, is not exempt from facing re-election at the next general election.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Septennial Act 1715 provided that a Parliament expired seven years after it had been summoned; this maximum period was reduced to five years by the Parliament Act 1911. Prior to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 parliaments had no minimum duration. Parliaments could be dissolved early by the monarch at the Prime Minister's request. Early dissolutions occurred when the make-up of Parliament made forming government impossible (as occurred in 1974), or, more commonly, when the incumbent government reasoned an early general election would improve their re-election chances (e.g. 2001). The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 mandated that Parliaments should last their full five years. Early dissolution is still possible, but under much more limited circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the government and Prime Minister are effectively indirectly elected through the Commons, the terms of Parliaments and MPs do not directly apply to offices of government, though in practice these are affected by changes in Parliament. While, strictly speaking, a Prime Minister whose incumbency spans multiple Parliaments only serves one, unbroken, term of office, some writers may refer to the different Parliaments as separate terms.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHereditary peers and life peers retain membership of the House of Lords for life, though members can resign or be expelled. Lords Spiritual hold membership of the House of Lords until the end of their time as bishops, though a senior bishop may be made a life peer upon the end of their bishopric (e.g. George Carey, made Baron Carey of Clifton the day after he ceased being Archbishop of Canterbury).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are variations on the system of government used at Westminster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of the leader of the devolved administrations has no numeric term limit imposed upon it. However, in the case of the Scottish Government and the Welsh Assembly Government there are fixed terms for which the legislatures can sit. This is imposed at four years. Elections may be held before this time but only if no administration can be formed, which has not happened yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nOffices of local government other regional elected officials follow similar rules to the national offices discussed above, with persons elected to fixed terms of a few years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the president of the United States is elected indirectly through the United States Electoral College to a four-year term, with a term limit of two terms (totaling eight years) or a maximum of ten years if the president acted as president for two years or less in a term where another was elected as president, imposed by the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1951.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vice President serves four-year terms. U.S. Representatives serve two-year terms. U.S. Senators serve six-year terms. \\r\\n\\r\\nFederal judges have different terms in office. Article I judges; such as those that sit on the United States bankruptcy courts, United States Tax Court, and United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and certain other federal courts and other forms of adjudicative bodies serve limited terms: The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for 15 years, bankruptcy courts for 14. However, the majority of the federal judiciary; Article III judges, such as those of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, and federal district courts; serve for life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe terms of office for officials in state governments varies according to the provisions of state constitutions and state law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term for state governors is four years in all states but Vermont and New Hampshire; the Vermont and New Hampshire governors serve for two years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures reported in January 2007 that among state legislatures [1]:\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong territories of the United States:\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of Council of the District of Columbia serve a four-year term.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a former British territory following the Westminster System, there are many similarities with the United Kingdom, although with some variations based on local customs, the federal system of government and the absentee monarch.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a Commonwealth realm, Canada shares a monarch with the United Kingdom and 14 other countries, who serves as head of state of all 16 realms until their death or abdication.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Governor General is appointed by the monarch as his/her personal representative on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serves for an indefinite term, though the normal convention is 5 years. Similarly, the Lieutenant Governors, who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial premier), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention. The territories have Commissioners, who are not representatives of the monarch, but are instead appointed by and represent the Governor-in-Council (i.e. the federal cabinet), and conventionally serve for about 5 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar to the United Kingdom, MPs serve for the duration of the Parliament. They may resign before the end of a Parliament or be elected in by-elections during the middle of a Parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Constitution Act, 1867, a Parliament may last for a maximum of 5 years from the most recent election before expiring, although all Parliaments to date have been dissolved before they could expire. Bill C-16, introduced in the 39th Parliament, provided for fixed election dates every 4 years on the third Monday in October, beginning in 2009. However, the Prime Minister may still advise the Governor General to dissolve Parliament at any time. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs in the United Kingdom, the cabinet and head of government are indirectly elected based on the composition of the House of Commons, they are not technically affected by the terms of legislators or Parliaments. In practice however, the terms of government office holders are affected by changes in the House of Commons, and those who serve for multiple consecutive Parliaments are generally considered to have served a single term. The term of a government generally ends when it is defeated on a confidence matter or the governing party fails to gain enough seats in a general election.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenators are appointed to the Canadian Senate to represent a province by the Governor General of Canada on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serve until the mandatory retirement age of 75. Senators appointed before the passage of the British North America Act, 1965 served for life. Senators may also resign from office or be expelled from the Senate.\\r\\n\\r\\nProvincial legislatures and the legislature of the Yukon function very similarly to the federal House of Commons. MLAs (called MPPs in Ontario, MNAs in Quebec, and MHAs in Newfoundland and Labrador) serve for the duration of the legislature, though they may resign before the legislature is dissolved or be elected in by-elections between general elections. The legislatures of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut operate using a consensus model, but are similar otherwise. The premiers and their cabinets are selected in the same way as in the House of Commons, and like at the federal level, the term of a provincial government can be ended by defeat in a general election or the loss of the legislature's confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll provincial legislatures except that of Nova Scotia have fixed-term election legislation in place, as does the legislature of the Northwest Territories. Premiers may also advise Lieutenant Governors to dissolve legislatures at any time before the prescribed election date.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumbers in years unless stated otherwise.

London is resident to the highest number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals in the world.[6] For some this is a cause for concern as it is leading to gentrification. The average house costs S290,000 to buy (September 2015), has 2.8 bedrooms, and is semi-detached.[7] Housing represents the largest non-financial asset in the UK with a net value of S5.1 trillion (2014).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very rapid growth in population in the 19th century in the cities included the new industrial and manufacturing cities, as well as service centers such as Edinburgh and London. The critical factor was financing, which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with large contracting firms.[9][10] Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. P. Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants.[11] People moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums. Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults.[12][13][14]\\r\\nThe rapid expansion of housing was a major success story of the interwar years, 1919ÿ1939, standing in sharp contrast to the United States, where new housing construction practically collapsed after 1929. The total housing stock in England and Wales was 7.6 million in 1911; 8.0 million in 1921; 9.4 million in 1931; and 11.3 million in 1939.[15]\\r\\nThe private sector rental market provided 90 percent of the housing before the war. Now came under heavy pressure, regarding rent controls, and the inability of owners to evict tenants, except for nonpayment of rent. The tenants had a friend in Prime Minister Lloyd George, and especially in the increasingly powerful Labour Party. The private rental sector went into a prolonged decline and never recovered; by 1938, it covered only 58 percent Of the housing stock.[16]\\r\\nA decisive change in policy was marked by the Tudor Walters Report of 1918; it set the standards for council house design and location for the next 90 years.[17][18] It recommended housing in short terraces, spaced at 70 feet (21?m) at a density of 12 to the acre.[19] With the Housing and Town Planning Act of 1919 Prime Minister David Lloyd George set up a system of government housing that followed his 1918 campaign promises of \\"homes fit for heroes.\\" Called the \\"Addison Act,\\" it required local authorities to survey their housing needs, and start building houses to replace slums. The treasury subsidized the low rents. The immediate impact was the prevalence of the three-bedroom house, with kitchen, bath, parlor, electric lighting, and gas cooking, often built as subsidized council housing. Major cities such as London and Birmingham built large-scale housing estates ÿ one in Birmingham had a population of 30,000. The houses were built in blocks of two or four Using brick or stucco, with two stories. They were set back from curving streets; each had a long garden strip. Shopping centers, churches and pubs sprang up nearby. Eventually The city would provide a community hall, schools, and a public library. The residents typically were the upper fifth stratum of the working class. The largest of these two communities was Becontree in the outer suburbs of London, where construction began in 1921 and by 1932 there were 22,000 houses holding 103,000 residents.[20] Slum clearance now moved from being a public health issue, to a matter of town planning.[21]\\r\\nLiberal MP Sir John Tudor Walters was inspired by the garden city movement, calling for spacious low-density developments and semi-detached houses built to a high construction standard. Older women could now vote. Local politicians consulted with them and in response put more emphasis on such amenities as communal laundromats, extra bedrooms, indoor lavatories, running hot water, separate parlours to demonstrate their respectability, and practical vegetable gardens rather than manicured yards. The housewives had had their fill of chamber pots.[22][23] Progress was not automatic, as shown by the troubles of rural Norfolk. Many dreams were shattered as local authorities had to renege on promises they could not fulfill due to undue haste, impossible national deadlines, debilitating bureaucracy, lack of lumber, rising costs, and the non-affordability of rents by the rural poor.[24]\\r\\nIn England and Wales, 214,000 multi-unit council buildings were built by 1939; making the Ministry of Health largely a ministry of housing.[25] Council housing accounted for 10 percent of the housing stock in Britain by 1938, peaking at 32 percent in 1980, and dropping to 18 percent by 1996, where it held steady for the next two decades.[26][27][28][29]\\r\\nIncreasing the British ideal was home ownership, even among the working class. Rates of home ownership rose steadily from 15 percent before 1914, to 32 percent by 1938, and 67 percent by 1996.[30] Local building societies were primarily responsible. In the 1920s favourable tax policies encouraged substantial investment in the societies, creating huge reserves for lending. Beginning in 1927, the societies encouraged borrowing through gradual liberalization of mortgage terms.[31]\\r\\nThe fierce debates over high-rise housing that took place after 1945 were presaged by an acrimonious debate in the 1920s and 1930s in London. It pitted enthusiastic advocates and angry critics of multistorey flats for social housing. On the political left, there was firm opposition to what was denounced as 'barracks for the working classes'. Reformers on the right called for multi-story solutions to overcrowding and high rents. One result were attempts to compromise by developing new solutions to urban living, focused especially on slum clearance and redevelopment schemes. The compromises generally sought to replace inhospitable slums with high-rise blocks served by lifts. In the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney they included John Scurr House (built 1936ÿ1937), Riverside Mansions (1925ÿ1928) and the Limehouse Fields project (1925 but never built).[32]\\r\\nHousing was a critical shortage in the postwar era. Air raids had destroyed a half million housing units; repairs and maintenance on undamaged had been postponed. In all 3 million new dwellings were needed. The government aimed for 300,000 annually, compared to the maximum prewar rate of 350,000. However, there were shortages of construction workers, materials, and money. Not counting 150,000 temporary prefabricated units, the nation was still 1.5 million units short by 1951. Legislation kept rents down, but did not affect purchased houses. The ambitious New Towns project was idealistic, but did not provide enough urgently needed units. When the Conservatives returned to power in 1951, they made housing a high priority and oversaw 2.5 million new units, two thirds of them through local councils. Haste made for dubious quality, and policy increasingly shifted toward renovation rather than new construction. Slums were cleared, opening the way for gentrification in the inner cities.[33]\\r\\nWorking-class families proved eager to purchase their council homes when the Thatcher government offered a good financial bargain in the 1980s.[34]\\r\\nIn early 2014 there were approximately 23 million dwellings in England, of which 63% were owner-occupied, 20% were private rented, and 17% were public housing.[35] The overall mean number of bedrooms was 2.8 in 2013ÿ14, 37% of households had at least two spare bedrooms.[7] 20% of dwellings were built before 1919 and 15% were built post 1990.[7] 29% of all dwellings are terraced, 42% are detached or semi-detached, and the remaining 29% are bungalows or flats. The mean floor area is 95 square meters.[7] Approximately 4% of all dwellings were vacant.[7] Approximately 385,000 households reported a fire between 2012 and 2014, the majority of which were caused by cooking.[36] In 2014 2.6 million households moved dwelling, the majority of which (74%) were renters.[7]\\r\\n The Labour government suspected that there might be supply-side problems in the construction sector, and in 2006 commissioned the Callcutt Review of House Building Delivery,[38] which was published in 2007. The Callcutt report noted the failure of the home building industry to increase the supply in response to price signals.[39]\\r\\nThere was a fall in the numbers of house completions after the 2008 recession, but by 2015 it was back up to 169,000.[40]\\r\\nIn 1950, in 2012 pounds, the average dwelling cost was S50,000 versus S75,000 in 2012.[41]\\r\\nIn September 2015 the average house price was S286,000, and affordability of housing as measured by price to earnings ratio was 5.3.[42]\\r\\nThere is concern that councils in central London are aggravating the housing crises by pursuing policies of gentrification.[43]\\r\\nLondon is ranked as the top city in the world in terms of the number of ultra high net worth individuals who are resident in a city.[6] The consequence of this is seen in the high price for top-end dwellings. The most expensive home ever sold in the UK was 2 to 8a Rutland Gate, Hyde Park, which sold for S280 million in 2015.[44] The most expensive street in the UK is Kensington Palace Gardens, London, where the average price of a home is approximately S42 million.[45]\\r\\nSee below for further information on the extent of London property kept empty by speculators.\\r\\nDwellings represent the largest non-financial asset in the UK balance sheet, with a net worth of S5.1 trillion (2014).[8] In the national statistics rising house prices are regarded as adding to GDP and thus a cause of economic growth.\\r\\nHistorically, the assumption in the media and elsewhere was that rising house prices were a good thing. There is evidence that the public no longer share this view.[46]\\r\\nNearly two out of five households rent their home.[35] In 2014 most rented dwellings where provided by private landlords.[35] The proportion of dwellings rented from of the private rented sector is increasing, whilst the public sector is declining. In the financial year 2014, the private rented sector increased by 123,000 dwellings, and the public sector declined by 9,000 dwellings.[35]\\r\\nIn the UK there is no property tax based on ownership, which many other OECD countries have.[48]\\r\\nHigh rents have not just affected those in the lower half of the income distribution. who always been lifelong renters. In the era of the KeynesÿBeveridge consensus those in the upper half of the income distribution would typically rent a home while saving for deposit to get on the property ladder. This is no longer possible; money which would have been used in saving for the deposit now goes in rent. The majority of new households formed in the UK can now expect to rent from a private landlord for life.[49] This phenomenon has been called generation rent and there is much debate about the social consequence of this change.[50] See inequality for further information.\\r\\nIn London, rents are double the national average and this is driving gentrification. Londoners on median earnings find they can no longer afford to rent an apartment in central London.[43][51] Those on median incomes, who work in central London have had to move to the outer suburbs, and the commuting towns in SE England.[52] Many find, that commuting using London's congested transport infrastructure lowers their standard of living, and is disruptive of family life.[53]\\r\\nIn June 2015 there were approximately 67,000 households in England in temporary accommodation.[54] In autumn 2014 there were around 2,400 rough sleepers in England, 27% of which were in London.[55][56]\\r\\nThe consequence of the housing shortage and high rents manifests itself in overcrowding rather than In homelessness, The problem of over crowding is especially acute in London.[57] In 2011 it was estimated that there were 391,000 children in London living in overcrowded conditions.[58]\\r\\nBetween 1995-1996 to 2013-2014 overcrowding, as measured by the bedroom standard increased from 63,000 households to 218,000 households.[59] The bedroom standard understates overcrowding. It does not include potential household units forced to live in the same dwelling. For example, divorced couples living in the same dwelling, adult children being unable to form own household but having to live with their parents.[60] It has not proved possible to find statistics on the true extent of overcrowding.\\r\\nA report issued by the Deputy Prime Minister's Office reviewed the evidence that overcrowding, in addition to the known impacts on physical health, adversely effects mental health, and child development.[61]\\r\\nIt is useful to consider housing quality under two sub headings physical and social. In the era of Beveridge Consensus there where large scale slum clearance projects. Council environmental health officers inspected dwellings in a borough and those which failed to meet standards were compulsorily purchased for a nominal sum and demolished.[62] New dwellings were built to rehouse the slum dwellers. Slum clearance significantly improved the physical quality of the UK housing stock. But in a seminal study Family and Kinship in East London it was found that although the physical quality of the housing had improved, its social quality had deteriorated. The residents of apartments in tower blocks appreciated their clean, warm, bright new apartments, but missed the supportive community networks of the slums.\\r\\nUndocumented migrants, as they fear being deported, are easily exploited, and do not report housing conditions which constitute a public health risk.[63] This means that the extent of the problem is not known.\\r\\nAlthough overall the quality of English housing stock has improved over the last thirty years (a generation), the quality of housing for new households formed from those at or below the median income has declined. Thirty years ago a new household in this group could rent a council house built to Parker Morris standard. In 2016, a new household from this group, has to rent from a private landlord a dwelling, which will have less space than the Parker Morris standard dwelling, and likely to be damp, and they pay in real terms, at least three time the rent of their parent's generation.[64][65]\\r\\nJessica McLean was a tenant who complained about a dwelling and claimed that she was evicted due to this.[66]\\r\\nFor many people the social life their home enables is as important as the physical conditions the home provides. There is a debate about whether the generation born in the 1980s are better or worse off than their parents.[67] Some economists claim living standards have improved for what has been called generation X, whilst others hold they have declined. The economist point to fourfold growth in the nation's GDP, an increase GDP per capita, and an increase median earnings.[67] Those who content that there has been a fall living standards for generation X, say that increasing GDP per capita can be, and is in the UK, associated with a declining quality of life. And that housing conditions of Generation X has made their standard of living far lower than that of their parents. They claim that the two major cause of decline in the social environment provided by housing are: symmetrical tenancy agreements and socially segregated housing developments.[67]\\r\\nNearly all dwellings are let using Shorthold Assured Tenancy agreements.[68] There is a short period, typically six months or a year, where neither side can terminate the agreement. After this period, both sides can terminate the agreement at a months notice.\\r\\nThere is evidence, that main the beneficiary of the symmetrical tenancy agreements have been UK landlords, as it has enabled rents rise not only faster than the RPI, but also far faster than wages.[69] In 2015 private sector rents in the UK rose by 4.9% with particular large rises in Brighton and Bristol whilst earnings growth in the UK was 2.9%.[70][71]\\r\\nFactors which lower the social quality of housing such as: homelessness and fear of homeless, and transient unfriendly neighborhoods have been attributed to symmetrical tenancy agreement.[72] Evidence of the comparative insecurity in the private rental sector is, is provided by the statistics on recent movers.[73] In the year 2013, for every 1,000 residents, 340 of those in the private rented sector would move, compared with 5 owner occupiers, and 9 in the public rented sector.[74]\\r\\nThe current position is that in London, only UK citizens who are top earners, are in the market to become home owners.[76][77] In London, the effective demand for new dwellings now comes from property investors, not those hoping to become owner occupiers. Property investors, are not primarily interested in whether a dwelling unit provides a good social environment for a family. The investor is looking for standardized dwelling units which can provide a good rental income and predictable maintenance costs. This has reduced the demand for three bedrooms houses with gardens, which are normally consider to provide the ideal family homes, instead the demand is for apartments in multi-story blocks.[77] In London, many such apartments are marketed too, and bought by foreign investors.[78] The ideal unit for such investors, is in a gated development with a tower block of apartments, with car parking instead of gardens. Standardized dwellings units are desirable as they can be traded on the global market like any other commodity.[79]\\r\\nThere is evidence that gated developments intensify social segregation, and rather than preventing crime they create fear of crime.[80] The residents of the gated development become fearful of those living outside of their secured space and only leave the development by car.[80] They are too fearful to walk out of it and socialize with their neighbours outside.[81]\\r\\nHaving separate estates for owner occupiers and council tenants reinforced class divisions and class stereotyping. There were residents on owner occupier estates who call those who lived on council estates 'common' meaning they were social inferiors, and there were residents in council estates who would call those lived in owner occupied estates 'snobs' meaning they people who were to proud to socialize with those they considered their social inferiors.[82] Due to limited social interaction between owner occupiers and council tenants there is much scope for misunderstanding.\\r\\nUK homes are some of the most expensive to heat in Europe, which results in high levels of fuel poverty (for further information see Fuel poverty in the United Kingdom).[83] The problem results from age of the housing stock with most dwellings being built prior to oil shock of 1973, after which insulation standards for newly build housing improved. The UK dwellings have the oldest age profile in the EU with over 60% being built before 1960, and with only just over 10% being built between 1991-2010.[84] The graph above on the history of construction of new dwellings shows this age profile is a consequence of the reduction in the number of in new dwellings build per year after 1979.\\r\\nThere is a particular problem with dwellings built before World War I (1914-1918), which are now over hundred years old.[85] The terraced houses of this period, build for sale to the buy to let investors of the time, are particular difficult to insulate. These dwellings were built for heating by open coal fires, and had large drafty windows to allow the fire to draw. They have very small rooms and have solid walls with a single tier of bricks. This structure makes wall insulation expensive and in many cases impractical.[86] Many of the dwellings of this type were replaced by council houses in the post war slum clearance program, but with the ending of public sector building of dwellings this route for improving the energy efficient of the housing stock ended.\\r\\nThere also insulation problems in the pre-1914 large houses built for the top decile of the time. These houses were built with servant quarters in the roof space. Most such houses have been converted into blocks of flats and sold to buy to let investors.[87] These flats are difficult to insulate, especial the top floor flat in the roof space.[88] The expense of insulation means that it is not often not cost effective for the landlord to insulate such dwellings. This is especially true in London, where due to the housing crisis, landlords can let a property in poor condition, and consequently improving the energy efficiency of a dwelling is not a priority for buy to let investors.\\r\\nThere is also a problem in that only half the poorly insulated dwelling in the private rental sector use central heating, instead using more expensive electrical heaters.[89]\\r\\nTo encourage home insulation the governments introduced The Green Deal, the Energy Company Obligation, and Energy Performance Certificates(EPCs).[90]\\r\\nThe Green Deal does not offer any subsidies or grants for home insulation. Instead a new type of loan is provided which is attached to the property rather than the individual who takes out the loan. The purchaser of property becomes liable for the loan taken out to insulate the property. The Green Deal policy has met substantial criticism. In 2013, the Telegraph wrote that the high rate of interest charged for loans taken out under the Green Deal will mean there will be insignificant take-up, and hence the policy will be ineffective.[91]\\r\\nThe energy company obligation provides means-tested grants for home insulation. The funding for these grants does not come from government taxation. Instead there is legislation that allows the energy utilities to raise a levy on all utility bills to pay for the means-tested insulation grants. In 2015 these charges added about S112 to the average utility bill.[92] If the utility fails to spend the money it raises from the levies in insulating the homes of those in fuel poverty, it is fined. There have been problems with the scheme; utilities have been paying fines rather than providing the insulation.[93]\\r\\nThe difficulties the utilities have had are in the low uptake of the grants. There is a particular problem in that most of the people in fuel poverty who are entitled to the grants are in the private rental sector. A tenant who applies for and gets a grant which improves his landlord's property has no security of tenure. The tenant will not benefit from reduced fuel bills, if the landlord puts up the rent, as the property has been improved. Understandably, tenants in fuel poverty have been reluctant to apply for the grants. The consequence of failure to take up grants is given as one of the reasons the UK is missing carbon reduction targets.[94]\\r\\nThe idea behind EPCs was that if those buying or renting a property are informed about its energy efficiency market forces will lead to better insulated dwellings. To improved the working of the market by providing better informed purchasers, under UK law, whenever a dwelling is built, sold, or rented an EPC is required.[95]\\r\\nAn EPC gives an indication of the energy efficiency of a dwelling. The certificates have been criticized as they are based on visual inspection of the property, and examination of documents, and not on measurements of energy use, or the insulation characteristic of the building.[96] It is not possible to calculate the cost of heating a dwelling from its EPC, or the amount of energy which can be saved by insulating a wall, roof or window. There are claims that EPCs are of no real value. It is held that a certificate which can be bought for just S34, produced as result of form filling exercise, can not possibility be as useful as a proper energy survey based on measurement.[97][98]\\r\\nThere have been improvements housing in insulation but this is manly in the owner-occupier sector. Between 2001 and 2013 the prevalence of cavity wall insulation of houses which have cavity walls rose from 39% to 68%. Over the same period the proportion of fully double-glazed dwellings rose from 51% to 80%.[99] It has not proved possible to find evidence that these improvements were the result of government policy or would have happened anyway.\\r\\nIf all the recommendations by energy performance certificates were implemented the notional carbon dioxide emissions from UK dwellings could be reduced by over 20%.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to official statistics, in October 2015, there were 600,179 vacant dwellings in England, a decline from the 610,123 from a year earlier. Of these vacant dwellings, 203,596 were vacant for more than six months.[102] This, it is believed, is mainly due to financial reasons, such as the owner being unable to sell the house or raise enough money to renovate the property.[103] Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EMDOs) allow councils to take over the management of long-term empty properties but these are generally seen as a last resort and only 43 EDMOs were successful from 2006 to 2011. Government statistics show that long-term empty homes are generally concentrated in the North of England and in seaside towns, where property prices are generally lower, with the lowest percentage in London, which had 20,795 long-term empty properties.[103]\\r\\nAccording to official statistics, the percentage of empty homes in England fell from 3.5% in 2008 to 2.6% in 2014.[104] One explanation for this housing transactions have picked up since the financial crisis, and because of government efforts to reduce the number of empty homes. An alternative explanation is that before April 2013 there was an incentive for property owners to report a property as empty, as there was a rebate on council tax for vacant property. And when this incentive was removed, property owners ceased informing the council that their property was empty, and this led to an apparent fall in empty homes reported by official statistics.[104]\\r\\nThe number of empty homes includes homes where the previous occupier is in prison, in care, in hospital or recently deceased.[104]\\r\\nThe charity Empty Homes argued that empty homes were helping contribute to the housing crisis, saying in a report \\"The longer a property is empty the more our housing assets are being wasted. Also, the longer a property lies empty, the more likely it is to deteriorate; the more it is likely to cost to bring back into use; and the more it is likely to be seen as a blight by the neighbours.\\"[104]\\r\\nAs of 2015, around 1.7% of homes in London are empty, which is a historically low level. The vacancy rate is much lower for London's private sector housing compared to the rest of the country, whereas the rates for affordable housing are \\"broadly similar\\".[105]\\r\\nResearch by Islington Council revealed that nearly a third of new dwellings built did not have anyone on the electoral register after six years, although this may exclude students and foreign tenants.[106] The Observer reported on what has been termed 'lights out London' .. 'where absentee owners push up property prices without contributing to the local economy'.[107] A local restaurateur explained the problems this caused, 'my original customers [have sold to ] non-doms who do not live in their [property].

Tony, an original character, is portrayed by Michael Weatherly, and Ziva, who first appeared in the third season, is portrayed by Cote de Pablo.[1] Frequently referred to by the portmanteau \\"Tiva\\" (for Tony and Ziva), the characters' flirtation and the idea of them eventually beginning a relationship became a subject of interest among viewers, and by 2010, TV Guide reported that \\"many fans have become obsessed with the romantic tension between Weatherly's character and co-worker Ziva\\".[2] Focus and media coverage on the pair escalated over the years, particularly after NCIS became the most watched television series in America during its tenth season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe characters were initially scripted as having a \\"cat and mouse\\" relationship,[3] something that continues into the later seasons. The pairing develops at a slow pace throughout the series and is dealt a number of obstacles. This includes Tony's \\"commitment phobias\\",[4] Ziva's trust issues, a series of other love interests, and Ziva being taken captive and presumed dead between Seasons 6 and 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the season 13 finale, Ziva is seemingly killed by a mortar attack arranged by former CIA Agent Trent Kort, and Tony learns that he and Ziva have a daughter, who she named after her sister, Tali. These events drive Tony to leave NCIS to care for their daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Weatherly was cast for the role of Anthony \\"Tony\\" DiNozzo in 2003 and appeared in every episode of the show's first 13 seasons. The character is portrayed as \\"complex\\": he is a former Baltimore homicide detective with a \\"heroic spirit\\"[6] as well as a \\"total dinosaur in terms of sexual politics\\".[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second season finale, NCIS series regular Caitlin Todd was killed off after Sasha Alexander, her portrayer, decided to permanently leave the show.[8] Shortly afterwards, series creator Donald P. Bellisario voiced intentions to replace Todd with another female lead, whom he stated would be \\"someone foreign who brings a whole new attitude\\".[9] He expressed hopes that the new character would be drastically different from Todd,[10] who was \\"kind of uptight\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne aspect Bellisario wanted to change was the way the character would interact with Tony. Though Tony and Kate had a \\"wonderful dynamic\\",[9] he ultimately thought that \\"[she] treated [him] like a big brother\\" and decided \\"to bring in a character that causes Tony to have to sit back and not quite be able to handle her\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nCote de Pablo, who was one of the last to audition,[12] was set to perform opposite Michael Weatherly to test for chemistry.[5] Weatherly improvised during the audition by brushing her hair back and commenting, \\"You remind me of Salma Hayek.\\"[13] De Pablo, who was initially upset by the departure from the script, stayed in character and \\"dismissed him completely\\".[5] She later said in an interview, \\"He totally did it with the other [actresses]. One other girl sort of flirted back with him, and she was sort of open. Which is what actors do! They're sort of open. But I got lucky and got the part because I responded the way they felt was right.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Bellisario, CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves \\"took one look at her and said, Wow!\\"[8] Co-executive producer Charles Floyd Johnson commented, \\"When you get actors who really listen and respond organically in the moment to what they're hearing, sometimes magic happens. They really seemed to get that immediately, and that doesn't always happen.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nProducers eventually decided to make de Pablo's character, who was given \\"the arresting name of Ziva David\\",[8] an Israeli agent.[5] Bellisario had previously discussed possibly scripting her as European or Australian.[9] She is introduced as having a soldier mentality[14] and as \\"[someone] who was comfortable in her own sexuality and used to working with men on an equal footing\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nTony and Ziva first meet in the \\"Kill Ari\\" two-part story arc at the beginning of Season 3 during the manhunt for Ari Haswari, Kate's killer and Ziva's half-brother.[15] Michael Weatherly and Cote de Pablo both point to \\"Under Covers\\", the eighth episode of that season, as the catalyst for the flirtation between the characters.[16][17] The episode involves Tony and Ziva being sent undercover as a married couple, an assignment that requires them to simulate sexual relations in order to solidify their cover.[18] De Pablo commented, \\"Michael and I talked about all of those scenes right before we did them. We had a totally different way of looking at it. In our minds, we thought the characters weren't faking anything. They just got carried away. Then all of the sudden after that, they saw each other in a different light.\\"[17] Weatherly discussed the creation of the \\"Under Covers\\" scenario:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis episode was so much fun to shoot. Cote de Pablo, who plays Ziva, came to me right before we were shooting the first scene where we kissed, and said, 'I've never kissed anyone on camera before.' I was expecting this timid little bird kiss, like a little peck, but she was like a lionessshe practically ate my head off! This is where TIVA (Tony+Ziva) started. We were told to really have fun with it, they wanted a sexy thing happening, and Cote delivered. I was just sort of along for the ride. And let's be honest, three out of the four letters in 'TIVA' are from Ziva, so what is the 'T' then? The crucible, is it the cross? I don't think so.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time, Bellisario said that he \\"kind of [likes] what's going on now\\" and that it was unlikely that the relationship would be taken further any time in the immediate future.[11] De Pablo agreed, saying, \\"I would think if the characters get together, the whole mystery would be done. I think it will be a lot more fun to play the tension.\\"[11] She elaborated in another interview, \\"My character has sort of this understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, but I think she would never admit it or hook up with someone in the workplace. He scares her to death. He is the epitome of the American man and all of the things that come out of his mouth are brutally stupid.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nTony is renowned for his juvenile sense of humor and \\"commitment phobias\\"[4] while Ziva is characterized as \\"a tease\\" early on, a factor that de Pablo enjoyed playing \\"because [she's] so not that in real life\\".[19] Some aspects of Ziva's personality disturb him, such as the fact that she sleeps with a gun in her hand and snores very loudly.[20][unreliable source?] However, as co-workers, they respect each other despite their frequent exchange of sarcastic remarks. Both have had a string of failed romances.[4][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nTeam leader Gibbs (Mark Harmon) resigns in Hiatus (Part II), the third season finale, and appoints Tony as his replacement.[22][better?source?needed] During the 2006 summer break, it was reported that Ziva would fall under suspicion of being a spy in the fall premiere,[19] and in the opening episode, \\"Shalom\\", she is framed by the Iranian government for the murder of a terrorist in FBI custody and the two agents guarding him.[23] When she initially goes to the Israeli embassy to report their deaths, which she witnessed, Mossad Officer Michael Bashan asks her directly, \\"Did you or did you not sleep with him?\\" In response to her confusion, Bashan tells her that he knows that Tony has been visiting her apartment at least once a week for the past three months and that Mossad officers have been spying on her, evidently on orders from her father, Mossad Director Eli David.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nCote de Pablo[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the episode, Tony vigorously defends Ziva's innocence to the FBI, as well as berating any agent who dares question her loyalty when her car is found at a bombing in downtown Georgetown. She is eventually cleared of all wrongdoing.[23] Though Ziva never addresses Bashan's accusation and her relationship with Tony is left undefined, there is no overt romantic connection in subsequent episodes.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly afterwards, Tony begins dating Jeanne Benoit (Scottie Thompson) and is shown to be on the verge of a serious commitment for the first time within the series.[22] His romance with Jeanne continues to progress throughout the year, and he remains tight-lipped about it when his colleagues notice the change in his behavior. When questioned about the effects this would have on Tony and Ziva's relationship, de Pablo commented, \\"Am I just being jealous? I don't know. I still love him very much, but I've sort of thrown away that possibility because I think he's really struggling with some immense feelings for somebody else.\\"[3] In an interview with Chicago Tribune, she clarified that Ziva \\"does have feelings for DiNozzo,\\" but that she was uncertain that this would be addressed.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Season 4 finale, \\"Angel of Death\\", it is made apparent that Tony and Jeanne's relationship was orchestrated by NCIS Director Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) in hopes of catching Jeanne's father, an arms dealer, though Tony had fallen in love while on assignment.[22] Jeanne breaks it off following this revelation, and their storyline is ultimately given closure in the fifth season episode \\"Internal Affairs\\".[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nBellisario stepped down as executive producer in May 2007 after series star Mark Harmon threatened to walk due to alleged \\"overly long production days\\",[26] and co-executive producer Charles Floyd Johnson and head writer Shane Brennan took over afterwards.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the fatal shooting of Director Shepard in the fifth season finale, the NCIS team is disbanded by the new Director Vance: McGee is sent to cyber crimes, Ziva is returned to Israel, and Tony is deployed on an aircraft carrier.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason 6 focuses more on Ziva and Tony, but leaves their relationship undefined. Gibbs manages to have Ziva and McGee transferred back to the team in the premiere, but Tony is still acting as agent afloat on the USS Seahawk. In the following episode, Ziva accompanies Gibbs onto the Seahawk as part of a murder investigation and notices that Tony has pictures of her in a bikini pinned up in his room.[29] After the investigation is closed, his deployment is ended prematurely and he is allowed to return to the team in the conclusion of the episode.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the season progresses, Ziva seems to have become involved with someone while in Israel but refuses to discuss it. In \\"Nine Lives\\", after she plans a visit to Israel, Tony looks through her desk and finds a picture of an unidentified man (Merik Tadros).[30] Before she leaves, he tells her to have a good trip (\\"Nisiya Tova\\") in Hebrew, demonstrating that he had at least made some effort to learn that phrase.[31] In \\"Cloak\\", Ziva disobeys Gibbs' orders to not engage during a war game, attacking the guards to defend Tony. Later they both say that they are \\"tired of pretending\\": Tony about the politics in the hunt for the mole within the team, which required the team to withhold information from each other, and Ziva for reasons undisclosed.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nProducers and writers for NCIS were initially divided over how to proceed with Tadros' character. In January 2009, some were suggesting possibly making him a relative of Ziva, an idea Cote de Pablo opposed. It was also proposed that Ziva would \\"stop toying with [Tony] completely\\" which would \\"drive him even more insane\\". De Pablo relayed, \\"We're going to play around with the idea that it could possibly be real love, and see how [he] deals with it.\\"[33] In March, executive producer Shane Brennan stated, \\"You've got what you might want to call a triangle. It's a triangle with very, very pointy ends. Someone's going to get hurt.\\"[34] He continued, \\"Something tragic will happen to Tony. Something tragic will happen to Ziva as well.\\"[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis comes to a head when Tadros appeared again portraying Mossad Officer Michael Rivkin in the \\"Legend\\" two-part, which also served as a backdoor pilot for the show's spin-off, NCIS: Los Angeles.[34] He arrives in the United States during the NCIS team's hunt for members of a terrorist sleeper cell.[35] Working independently, he draws ire from the agency when he kills suspects rather than bringing them in for questioning. Tony begins to doubt Ziva's loyalty to NCIS when she continues to defend Rivkin, and it becomes apparent by the end of Part II that she is involved in a relationship with him as the two are seen lying together in bed in the last few seconds of \\"Legend Part 2\\".[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore details were released in the days preceding the finale. Michael Weatherly disclosed, \\"The way this season is ending, and what's gonna happen with Ziva and Tony and Rivkin, it's pretty massive and explosive, and it's gonna span four episodes.\\"[37] De Pablo added, \\"We could not be farther away from kissing. I'm telling you, it's not 'I hate you' [kissing sound] anger; it's 'I want to kill you' anger. Like, 'I want to shoot you in the head, but instead I'm gonna put my gun on your knee' anger.He does something to her that is almost unforgivable. However, the reason he does it is because he truly believes it's going to help her. Little does he know that he almost kills her.\\"[17] When asked how the storyline would affect Tony and Ziva's interactions, Tadros replied, \\"I think that love can hurt and heal. In this case, we'll have opportunity to see both of those things take place. I don't want to say too much, but... I think it will only make their connection stronger, as they learn a lot more about each other.\\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nViewers speculated that Ziva's romance with Rivkin was \\"arranged\\" and something that she was \\"trapped\\" in.[36] Tadros responded:\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, with the underworld of espionage, you would never really know. They could easily have been paired and had to be in love and then had to learn to love each other.... The way I've always approached it is that Rivkin loves Ziva. They've always wanted to add some suspense and mystery to all of it, but I would always say to the directors, 'How could I not love her?' But he also has a job to do. And so does she. [Executive producer] Shane [Brennan] is a genius, so it's been a great pleasure to just go along for this ride. I'm excited to watch the finale [airing May 19] myself just to see how it all plays out![36]\\r\\n\\r\\nTony confronts a drunken Rivkin at Ziva's apartment in the episode directly prior to the finale. When he attempts to arrest Rivkin for killing the leader of the terrorist cell in Los Angeles and also an ICE agent (which Mossad leader Eli David later reveals was an accident), a fight breaks out between the two men which eventually results in Tony being forced to shoot Rivkin in self-defense due to the fact that Rivkin is about to stab Tony with a piece of glass.[23] Though he had acted in self-defense, Rivkin later succumbs to his injuries and dies with his death having serious repercussions for Tony and Ziva's relationship, culminating in Ziva leaving NCIS to resume working for Mossad in the finale, \\"Aliyah\\".[23] She is quickly assigned to take Rivkin's place on a mission to take down a terrorist in Somalia. In the closing moments of the episode, she is shown to have been captured and tortured nearly beyond recognition by a terrorist demanding information on NCIS.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrennan reportedly kept the cliffhanger ending a secret from most of the cast, saying that \\"those pages were only in one copy of the script\\".[39] Shortly after \\"Aliyah\\" aired, it was assured that Ziva \\"will be back next season. But she'll be a changed woman.\\"[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer hiatus, de Pablo admitted that she was to a point tired of the producers teasing the pairing and said, \\"I wish the writers would just make it easy for us and just say, 'You know, go into the elevator and kiss passionately.' Or, [have us say] say, 'I don't like you.'\\"[41] She added, \\"But I've always thought that, deep inside, Tony loves Ziva and Ziva loves Tony, but she's almost ashamed of saying it because he's so stupid. In the best of ways. That personal that he comes out with, that frat boy thing -- he's hiding constantly from the truth. It's just a big facade and she sees right through it.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Season 7 premiere \\"Truth or Consequences\\", Tony initiates a mission of revenge against the terrorists believed to be responsible for Ziva's (presumed) death, traveling to Somalia along with Gibbs and McGee to avenge her murder.[42] After intentionally allowing himself to be captured and interrogated, he finds that Ziva is actually still alive, having been held hostage the entire time. Upon being brought into the room to talk to him, she is shown to have been severely beaten and very weak as well as unsure of how to react at Tony's presence. Ziva asks why Tony is in Somalia, saying that he should not have come. Tony, under truth serum, first deflects. When Ziva asks again, he replies, \\"I couldn't live without you, I guess.\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, Gibbs kills their captor with a long range head shot, allowing them to return safely to the US.[43] In the following episode, there seems to be a great degree of awkwardness between them, which is ultimately resolved when Ziva confronts Tony in the men's room and thanks him, saying he would \\"always have her back\\" before kissing him on the cheek.[44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Weatherly, 2009[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Tony and Ziva's \\"will they/won't they\\" tension appeared to progress during the first few episodes of the seventh season, Cote de Pablo had already stated that it would not be resolved in the immediate future.[41] Michael Weatherly opined that putting the two characters together at the time would be \\"Kryptonite\\" due to Ziva's assassin background.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nZiva resigns from Mossad in the fourth episode of the season, \\"Good Cop, Bad Cop\\", and applies to become a full-fledged NCIS agent, effectively becoming the \\"probie\\"[note A] on the team.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2009, TV Fanatic announced that \\"the January 26 episode finds Tony and Ziva hopping a plane to the most romantic city on earth. The city of light, and of love. That's right, Ziva and Tony in Paris! You wouldn't believe it, but as if that weren't enough, their French hotel totally screws up the reservation and the two bad-ass agents end up ... gulp ... sharing a room together.\\"[48] Executive producer Shane Brennan disclosed, \\"There will be a realization that the spark is still there. It doesn't mean that something is going to be resolved, but it does mean that the journey may have started again. It's a long road back. When you think about what they went through, for them to resolve what happened and come to terms with that, it's a long road back.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the episode, Ziva tells a witness that she and Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much speculation on the part of fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, \\"The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they say, I think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing.\\"[50] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had \\"a tremendous amount of fun\\" in Paris and that, \\"Ziva had more fun with Tony than she thought she was going to have, which maybe shocked her a little bit, because she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year.\\"[51] Cote de Pablo added, \\"Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good.\\"[51] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond \\"unfulfilled sexual tension\\".[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following episode \\"Masquerade\\", Ziva mentions her time in Somalia, but refuses to give Tony much more than a few terse statements about it, though he was obviously willing to listen to her.[52] In the final episode of Season 7, \\"Rule Fifty-One\\", Tony misses Ziva's citizenship ceremony due to an unexpected assignment from Director Vance, despite his personal promises to her that he would be there.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutive producer Shane Brennan left NCIS to focus on the spinoff, NCIS: Los Angeles, and was replaced by Gary Glasberg in 2011.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series introduced new love interests for both Tony and Ziva in the latter half of Season 8, and in February 2011, Michael Ausiello from TVLine announced that Ziva's boyfriend \\"Ray arrives in this season's 20th episode and is described as a handsome, charming, intelligent federal agent of Mediterranean or Latin American descent. He has a strong, nice-guy demeanor butI'm quoting from the casting notice here'there's a hint of a mystery behind his smile.'\\"[55] A week later, Glasberg described the character as a \\"fun, smart, exciting addition\\",[56] and Michael Weatherly commented, \\"I think it's going to be interesting. Tony cares about Ziva and wants to make sure she's not mixed up with the wrong kind of guy, so he's going to be watchful and protective of her.\\"[56] After Enrique Murciano was cast for the role of Ray Cruz, Cote de Pablo said, \\"You never know if you're gonna have chemistry, and since I had no say in the casting, I was sort of waiting to meet this famous Enrique Murciano.\\"[57] She went on to describe his appearance in the show: \\"There's a lovely scene in which he basically brings his interpretation of 'fancy' candlelight dinner, which takes place by the vending machines at NCIS. It's really funny. There's kissing involved. We kept it light and we kept it fun, and we kept it like two people who are genuinely in to each other and wanting to move things along. It's about what's going on between the lines. These two people are touchy-feely, and that's different for Ziva.\\"[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of Erica Jane \\"EJ\\" Barrett (Sarah Jane Morris) was set to be introduced in the episode \\"One Last Score\\", which also marked Weatherly's directing debut.[6] Weatherly divulged, \\"With the appearance of EJ, suddenly there's a renewed spirit that Tony has always had in him ÿ it's what made him to go Africa and rescue Ziva with McGee. [Sometimes] he acts like a goofball because that's what people expect, but in this episode he comes away from that place. We'll see what the audience thinks, but for me, he feels potential and possibility in a way that he hasn't for years. EJ is a mirror, so he sees that hope for himself again.\\"[6] He added, \\"She's the diametric opposite of Ziva ÿ physically, and in her demeanor, her way of being. She has her eccentricities as well, which makes her adorable to Tony and highly irritating to Ziva.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the same time, a \\"major serial killer plot\\" was launched that would center on \\"a murdering psychopath\\" called the Port to Port killer.[58] TVLine reported, \\"this menace will prove to be extremely formidable   so much so that Gibbs will be forced to expand his team.\\"[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of EJ's first episode, she begins a sexual relationship with Tony. She is a team leader, having accepted the assignment in Rota, Spain that Tony had turned down several years prior.[6] Ray, a CIA agent, first appears in \\"Two-Faced\\" after having evidently dated Ziva for several months. Ziva abruptly ends their relationship after learning that he had lied to her directly about his reasoning for being in Washington, D.C. and by omission about his role in the Port to Port killer case.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Swan Song\\", former NCIS agent Mike Franks is killed by the Port to Port killer, who is identified as Lieutenant Jonas Cobb, and Ziva turns to Tony for comfort while the team is grieving over his death.[60] She is kidnapped by Cobb in the following episode, the Season 8 finale, and Tony shows great concern. When EJ assures him that they will find Ziva, he replies that \\"it's just different for some of us\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nEJ takes an extended leave of absence with the conclusion of the season, ending her affair with Tony. Ziva and Ray repair their relationship somewhat, and he gives her an empty ring box as a \\"promise\\" before leaving for a long-term assignment. Glasberg commented, \\"Ziva and Ray are a little open-ended at the moment. There isn't any closure to it. We'll have to see where it leads, but I think he was pretty clear that he has a job to do at the moment, and that's gonna be the primary focus for him.\\"[61] The use of the ring box was criticized by viewers as an \\"empty gesture\\".[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nEJ returns for a guest appearance in the Season 9 episode \\"Housekeeping\\". After a fallout with Tony, she tells him that Ziva respects him and cares about him. He at first deflects but then says, \\"Surround yourself with people you would give your own life for.\\" At the end of the show, he and Ziva have a brief discussion about their relationship but are interrupted when Ray calls her.[63] Ray returns after spending several months on his overseas assignment in the following episode and proposes to Ziva, much to her shock.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nGlasberg said that Tony would not openly oppose the possibility of her getting engaged, explaining, \\"Tony wants Ziva to be happy. He's protective of her and cares about her and has feelings for her, and, at the end of the day, wants to make sure that she's safe and happy with the direction of her life.\\"[64] Though Ziva accepts Ray's proposal after some hesitation, she confronts him and breaks off the engagement after realizing that he had killed a woman on American soil while attempting to rectify a failure from overseas.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Weatherly, 2013[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the ninth season finale, \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\", a bomb is planted by domestic terrorist Harper Dearing. Tony and Ziva, feeling bad about missing Jimmy and Breena's wedding, try to cheer each other up by joking about how awful weddings arean exchange that begins to take on meaning when they become wistful about \\"the vow, the ring, the kiss, the ketubah...\\" and eloping instead of dealing with all the fuss. Later, when the Navy Yard is seconds from exploding, Ziva refuses to leave the building without Tony. The bomb goes off while they are still in the elevator; Ziva and Tony fall to the ground, with Tony's arm around her waist, and their free hands clasped tightly as the elevator appears to crash.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nGlasberg stated that the Season 10 premiere would \\"pick up with them in that elevator\\" and that there would be \\"some conversations\\".[67] When questioned about the framing of the situation, he replied that their time trapped in the elevator would be the \\"trajectory\\" for a more in depth look at the relationship later in the tenth season.[65] He added, \\"The consensus was to do that more of that this season, to peel back some layers and find little moments  and [ever since then] we're finding opportunities I think the Tony and Ziva fans will really enjoy.\\"[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tenth season was promoted as \\"Season X\\",[68] and Michael Weatherly dubbed it the \\"Year of Tiva\\",[69][70] saying, \\"This is the year. Trust me. This is the year.\\"[65] Cote de Pablo was more apprehensive and said, \\"I think that is maybe Michael and his wishful thinking. I've had years in which I thought, 'Oh my God, this a Tiva year,' and there have been years he thought were Tiva years. The truth is, we have yet to find out where that storyline is going to go. I think they're toying around with us like they always do.\\"[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, shortly after the season began, TV Guide announced, \\"In a November episode of CBS' NCIS, the origins of Tony's fascination with cinema will be explained  and strengthen his bond with Ziva.\\"[71] This involved him finding an old camera with photographs of his mother and later showing them to Ziva. Weatherly stated, \\"She was really the beginning of his love for movies and why that is such a deep, penetrating part of who he is. The last gift she gave him was to turn to the movies as a moral compass.\\"[71] De Pablo divulged, \\"We end up going deeper with each other than ever before. It's a profound, soft, vulnerable moment.\\"[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was followed by \\"Ziva reminiscing with her partner about her dead sister [Tali]\\".[72] In \\"Shell Shock (Part II)\\", she attempts to purchase tickets to the opera but is unable due to it being sold out. Tony, believing her to be going on a date, badgers her until she admits that she goes to the opera every year on her deceased sister's birthday, as Tali had wanted to be a singer. Unable to obtain tickets for her himself, he makes a CD of opera music and gives it to her to listen to.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the eleventh episode of Season 10 and the first of 2013, \\"Shabbat Shalom\\", Ziva's estranged father Eli is killed in a house attack, along with Director Vance's wife Jackie.[74] Glasberg discussed the ramifications that would be shown in the following episode, \\"Shiva\\", saying, \\"There's a part of Ziva that's wounded, and broken, and Tony is there for her  as a friend, and as a coworker ... We end up back in Tony's apartment, and there's some really lovely, emotional stuff that happens.\\"[75][better?source?needed] He added, \\"You'll really see Tony be there for her and support her and emotionally be strong for her. It's all the things I hope that people who enjoy the Tony-Ziva relationship will look for.\\"[74] Throughout the episode, Tony attempts to comfort Ziva, taking her to his apartment as a precaution against the possibility of her being the next target and bringing her long-time Israeli friend Shmeil Pinkhas to stay with them. Near the end of the episode, he comes to see her off as she prepares to fly to Israel for Eli's funeral and assures her in Hebrew that she is not alone.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen asked if the dynamic between the characters would continue to progress, de Pablo remarked, \\"I have a feeling that they're going to want to play with that [relationship] a little bit more and see where that goes. I think they're always testing that relationship and they're always throwing things at it to see how far they can take [it]. It's already a very complex relationship. They're very close; they're very good friends; and they trust each other. So, I think the complexity of it all can go further and I think they're going to explore more.\\"[77] Pauley Perrette, who portrays series regular Abby Sciuto, openly opposed it and said, \\"I don't want any of our cast members to be in relationships on screen at all. I like things the way they are, so I'm not in [to] that. I'm petitioning against it.\\"[77]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Berlin\\", set later in the season, features Tony and Ziva departing for Germany to track down Ilan Bodnar, her father's killer. Before the episode aired, Glasberg disclosed that they would share a slow dance while there, resulting in \\"a very personal moment of vulnerability where her guard goes down and she lets herself melt into his arms\\".[78] De Pablo added, \\"You also see [Tony] as a man Teddy Bear  like, a very sweet but manly man, a guy who's really taking care of a situation and really wants to make it better, a guy who's not looking for the joke or is uncomfortable staring at a woman or reaching out to hold her hand.\\"[79] This is highlighted in the closing scenes as the two of them drive home from the airport, and Ziva explains her animosity towards Orli Elbaz (Marina Sirtis), the new director of Mossad: Elbaz was the reason her parents split up. She tells Tony, \\"If it were not for Orli, things would be different. I would be a different person.\\" Tony then takes her hand, and Ziva intertwines their fingers together. Tony replies, \\"Then I should catch her before she leaves, you know, and thank her.\\" The episode ends with a cliffhanger when an unknown vehicle crashes into them, leaving their fates unknown.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Pablo described the filming of the dancing scene:\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael and I crafted that scene. We felt the moment was very intimate, and we thought that just looking at each other was enough. And the director kept saying, 'No, I want the moment to be longer,' and we had to sort of fight the director. Finally, I had to say, 'Listen, if there was any more time of staring into each other's eyes, it would be like, cut to a hotel room.'so finding the length of the moment became a topic. We certainly enjoyed it. I told [Tony]  without really realizing what I was saying and then I realized it came out the wrong way  I said, 'God, I felt a little drunk when I was staring at you.' I'm not sure if it was because by the end of the day we were both so tired or if it was because it was just such a magical moment.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey both survive the crash, and despite being urged to back off by various other characters, Ziva ultimately kills Bodnar in the following episode. This leads to DOD investigator Richard Parsons (Colin Hanks) initiating a witch hunt against the team and Ziva being aggressively interrogated about her conduct in the aftermath of her father's death.[81] When he accuses her of sleeping with an old friend while in Israel, Tony, who had been viewing the interrogation from the observation room, abruptly ends it and forces Parsons out. When he approaches Ziva about the accusation, she admits that it was a \\"moment of weakness\\" because she felt alone. This obviously hurts Tony, and he says, \\"My Hebrew must not be as good as I thought because I could've sworn when I dropped you off at the airport, I told you you are not alone\\". Ziva recalls this, and Tony says that they must have different interpretations before walking away. Despite this, he later confronts Parsons, demanding that Ziva be left alone and calling her his best friend.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nGary Glasberg in an interview when asked if Ziva \\"friend zoned\\" Tony in the Season 10 finale[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following episode, the Season 10 finale, tension exists until Ziva privately tells Tony that she is sorry if she hurt him during the ordeal, that she cares too much about their friendship, and that she does not want things to be awkward between them. He kisses her forehead and assures her that \\"nothing is awkward between friends\\".[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite concerns to the contrary, Glasberg denied that Ziva \\"friend zoned\\" Tony in the finale.[82] He explained, \\"It might not satisfy everyone out there, but I think we're getting there  she even reaches up with her hand and puts it very gently, and in a lovely way, on his shoulder before that kiss happens. I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced from where we were a year ago.\\"[82] In response to complaints about the pace of the development, he said, \\"There are a lot of fans who would like to see that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful.\\"[84] He maintained, \\"We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were at the beginning of the season. [The couple's closeness] may not be the big leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we're getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [Tony and Ziva] would be very conscious of. So I think they would tread lightly, which is why, in theory, we're treading lightly and being very careful about the steps that we take.\\"[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 10, 2013 it was announced that Cote De Pablo would not be returning to her role as Ziva David for the upcoming 11th season.   De Pablo stated \\"I've had 8 great years with NCIS and Ziva David. I have huge respect and affection for Mark, Gary, Michael, David, Rocky, Pauley, Brian, Sean, all of the team and CBS. I look forward to finishing Ziva's story.\\"      However it was announced that Cote De Pablo would return for the beginning of season 11 to wrap up Ziva's storyline.   Show runner Gary Glasberg stated in an interview with EW that:  \\"The amazing resolution you're going to see is pretty damn heart-wrenching and we're incredibly proud of it,\\" he writes. \\"Prepare yourselves for a moment in television history. Images that will end up in the archives. I couldn't be happier with how my NCIS family stepped up and did some of the most emotional work we've ever done.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 24, 2013 the episode \\"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot\\" aired and on October 1, 2013 \\"Past, Present, and Future\\" aired, opening with the introduction of a new threat: Benham Parsa and also the Brotherhood of Doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the episode, \\"Past, Present and Future\\", Tony heads to Israel to search for Ziva but eventually finds no sign of her, although a few months later he finds her in hiding at the very farmhouse where she was born, Ziva having gone to examine herself and her past.\\r\\n\\r\\nTony and Ziva share their first on-screen kiss as themselves on the tarmac in Tel-Aviv. However, in 2013, showrunner Gary Glasberg told TVLine the characters had shared another smooch in a previous season, but it did not make the cut.[85]  The couple previously kissed in season 3, episode 8 Under Covers during a covert operation as married assassins.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite Tony's efforts to persuade Ziva to return to the United States and NCIS, Ziva instead chooses to stay in Israel, with Tony reluctantly returning to the United States although Tony manages to find Ziva's Star of David necklace in his jacket pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the season 13 finale \\"Family First,\\" after learning of Ziva's death in the bombing of her Israel home caused by Trent Kort, the NCIS crew mourn her. Tony is then introduced to his almost two-year-old daughter, Tali. Conflicted, Tony asks Mossad Director Orli Elbaz about Ziva's motivations for not telling him about Tali. Orli tells him that she wanted to, especially as Tali grew but that she feared he would not be pleased, to which Tony tells her \\"Then she never knew me at all.\\" Later in the episode, Tony finds a picture of him and Ziva in Paris, to which Tali points to each of them, saying \\"Ima\\" and \\"Abba\\" indicating that she knew who he was, her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter killing Kort, Tony and Gibbs have a heart to heart, where DiNozzo informs him that he is moving on from NCIS, with his daughter, his family.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidently we have a daughter, me and Ziva. She knew me better than I thought. When McGee called, something hit me. I got this feeling, something I'd never felt before. In that moment, I didn't want Trent Kort dead. All I wanted to do was take care of Tali. Everything she had in her life was gone. Except me. I'm it. I'm everything to that little girl now. And I've never been anybody's everything before. But that's it. I'm done now. I'm going to take Tali to Israel, look for some answers. Then I'm going to take her to Paris. Ziva loves Paris. And you gotta believe what you gotta believe. [holds out his right hand as if to offer Gibbs a handshake] I'd say thank you but it doesn't quite cover it, boss.\\r\\nSpeaking of Ziva's fate, Glasberg stated \\"Tremendous thought was put into every element of what you saw last night...down to the lines of dialogue, the specific wordage. At the end of the day, I leave it in the hands of our fantastic fans and audience\\".[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the seasons, Tony and Ziva's flirtation attracted much media attention, commentary, and praise.[24][48][87][88] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the characters' \\"love-hate banter gives the show extra zip\\" during Cote de Pablo's first year on the show.[11] They have been called a \\"power couple\\" by Entertainment Weekly[78] and \\"one of TV's hottest couples\\" by TV Guide.[3] In May 2009, they were pictured on the cover of TV Guide Magazine and described as \\"TV's hottest love-hate relationship\\".[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nFondness for the pairing led to a dislike for some of Tony and Ziva's other love interests on the show;[36] by contrast, EJ, Tony's ex, became well-received after encouraging him to pursue a relationship with Ziva.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pairing's slow progression was discussed by reviewers, and Ariane Lange from BuzzFeed referred to it as \\"their sexual-tension-ridden not-quite-love affair\\".[91] Some viewers became frustrated with the show's seeming unwillingness to allow the characters to enter an actual relationship. Ryan expressed sentiment on the matter in 2009: \\"It's hard not to enjoy the chemistry between investigators Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) and Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly)...It makes me grind my teeth with frustration that TV writers and producers are so averse to putting will-they-or-won't-they couples together.\\"[41] Executive producer Gary Glasberg admitted to feeling pressure from the audience to pair them officially.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe couple was not universally accepted among viewers, and a portion of the audience felt that pairing the characters would disrupt the dynamics of the series.[92] Matt Webb Mitovich from TVLine suggested that the dispute among fans over how far \\"Tiva\\" should be taken had left producers in a \\"no win\\" situation, saying, \\"Quite honestly, I think NCIS and show boss Gary Glasberg face a tremendously difficult juggling act with this (would-be) couple because it is TV's most watched program, and like a game of Jenga, you can't be quite sure which slight move could send things toppling. Is NCIS No. 1 because it metes out exactly 25 milligrams of romance every third episode, and never a bit more? Is there a fear that going all-in with Tiva will soap up the show too much?\\"[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, Kate Stroup listed Tony and Ziva among Entertainment Weekly's \\"10 'Will They/Won't They' TV Couples\\", saying, \\"The chemistry is undeniable.\\"[93] In 2012, they appeared again in the magazine's \\"30 Best 'Will They/Won't They?' TV Couples\\".[94] Similarly, the pair was included in BuddyTV's  compile of \\"The Top 12 Will-They-or-Won't-They Couples of 2012\\"[95] and TV Guide's top 15 \\"TV Duos Who Should Do It\\".[96]","input":"What episode do ziva and tony first kiss?"},{"output":"around 300 known species","context":"The octopus (/??kt?p?s/ or ~/p?s/) is a soft-bodied, eight-armed mollusc of the order Octopoda. Around 300 species are recognised and the order is grouped within the class Cephalopoda with squids, cuttlefish and nautiloids. Like other cephalopods, the octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beak, with its mouth at the centre point of the arms (which are sometimes mistakenly called \\"tentacles\\"). The soft body can rapidly alter its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze through small gaps. They trail their eight arms behind them as they swim. The siphon is used both for respiration and for locomotion, by expelling a jet of water. Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates.\\r\\nOctopuses inhabit various regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow fast, mature early and are short-lived. During breeding, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies. The female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies.\\r\\nStrategies to defend themselves against predators include the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, their ability to jet quickly through the water, and their ability to hide. All octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to be deadly to humans.\\r\\nOctopuses appear in mythology as sea monsters like the Kraken of Norway and the Akkorokamui of the Ainu, and probably the Gorgon of ancient Greece. A battle with an octopus appears in Victor Hugo's book Toilers of the Sea, inspiring other works such as Ian Fleming's Octopussy. Octopuses appear in Japanese erotic art, shunga. They are eaten by humans in many parts of the world, especially the Mediterranean and the Asian seas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientific Latin term octopus was derived from Ancient Greek ?ٶ?? or ?ٶ?-, a compound form of ?ٶ? (okt, \\"eight\\") and ?? (pous, \\"foot\\"), used for example by Alexander of Tralles (c. 525-c. 605) for the common octopus.[3][4][5][6] The standard pluralised form of \\"octopus\\" in English is \\"octopuses\\" /??kt?p?s?z/;[7] the Ancient Greek plural ?ٶ?Ѵ?, \\"octopodes\\" /?k?t?p?di?z/, has also been used historically.[8] The alternative plural \\"octopi\\" ÿ which misguidedly assumes it is a Latin \\"-us\\"-word ÿ is considered grammatically incorrect,[9][10][11][12] but is used frequently enough to be acknowledged by the descriptivist Merriam-Webster 11th Collegiate Dictionary and Webster's New World College Dictionary. The Oxford English Dictionary lists \\"octopuses\\", \\"octopi\\", and \\"octopodes\\", in that order, calling \\"octopodes\\" rare and noting that \\"octopi\\" is based on a misunderstanding.[13] New Oxford American Dictionary (3rd Edition 2010) lists \\"octopuses\\" as the only acceptable pluralisation, and indicates that \\"octopodes\\" is still occasionally used, but that \\"octopi\\" is incorrect.[14]\\r\\nThe giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini) is often cited as the largest known octopus species. Adults usually weigh around 15?kg (33?lb), with an arm span of up to 4.3?m (14?ft).[15] The largest specimen of this species to be scientifically documented was an animal with a live mass of 71?kg (156.5?lb).[16] Much larger sizes have been claimed for the giant Pacific octopus:[17] one specimen was recorded as 272?kg (600?lb) with an arm span of 9?m (30?ft).[18] A carcass of the seven-arm octopus, Haliphron atlanticus, weighed 61?kg (134?lb) and was estimated to have had a live mass of 75?kg (165?lb).[19][20] The smallest species is Octopus wolfi, which is around 2.5?cm (1?in) and weighs less than 1?g (0.035?oz).[21]\\r\\nThe octopus is bilaterally symmetrical along its dorso-ventral axis; the head and foot are at one end of an elongated body and function as the anterior (front) of the animal. The head includes the mouth and brain. The foot has evolved into a set of flexible, prehensile appendages, known as arms, that surround the mouth and are attached to each other near their base by a webbed structure.[22] The arms can be described based on side and sequence position (such as L1, R1, L2, R2) and divided into four pairs.[23][22] The bulbous and hollow mantle is fused to the back of the head and is known as the visceral hump; it contains most of the vital organs.[24][25] The mantle cavity has muscular walls and contains the gills; it is connected to the exterior by a funnel or siphon.[22][26] The mouth of an octopus, located underneath the arms, has a sharp hard beak.[25]\\r\\nThe skin consists of a thin outer epidermis with mucous cells and sensory cells, and a connective tissue dermis consisting largely of collagen fibres and various cells allowing colour change.[22] Most of the body is made of soft tissue allowing it to lengthen, contract, and contort itself. The octopus can squeeze through tiny gaps; even the larger species can pass through an opening close to 2.5?cm (1?in) in diameter.[25] Lacking skeletal support, the arms work as muscular hydrostats and contain longitudinal, transverse and circular muscles around a central axial nerve. They can extend and contract, twist to left or right, bend at any place in any direction or be held rigid.[27][28]\\r\\nThe interior surfaces of the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an acetabulum, both of which are thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.[29][30]\\r\\nThe eyes of the octopus are large and are at the top of the head. They are similar in structure to those of a fish and are enclosed in a cartilaginous capsule fused to the cranium. The cornea is formed from a translucent epidermal layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris and lies just behind. The lens is suspended behind the pupil and photoreceptive retinal cells cover the back of the eye. The pupil can be adjusted in size and a retinal pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.[22]\\r\\nSome species differ in form from the typical octopus body shape. Members of the suborder Cirrina have stout gelatinous bodies with webbing that reaches near the tip of their arms, and two large fins above the eyes, supported by an internal shell. Fleshy papillae or cirri are found along the bottom of the arms, and the eyes are more developed.[31][32]\\r\\nOctopuses have a closed circulatory system, where the blood remains inside blood vessels. Octopuses have three hearts; a systemic heart that circulates blood round the body and two branchial hearts that pump it through each of the two gills. The systemic heart is inactive when the animal is swimming and thus it tires quickly and prefers to crawl.[33][34] Octopus blood contains the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous and it requires considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg.[33][34][35] In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.[33][34]\\r\\nThe systemic heart has muscular contractile walls and consists of a single ventricle and two atria, one for each side of the body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular endothelium which is quite unlike that of most other invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.[22]\\r\\nRespiration involves drawing water into the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon.[36] Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles and allow them to expand the respiratory chamber.[37] The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20?C.[38] Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.[37][35]\\r\\nThe thin skin of the octopus absorbs additional oxygen.[39] When resting, around 41% of an octopus's oxygen absorption is through the skin. This decreases to 33% when it swims, as more water flows over the gills; skin oxygen uptake also increases. When it is resting after a meal, absorption through the skin can drop to 3% of its total oxygen uptake.[39]\\r\\nThe digestive system of the octopus begins with the buccal mass which consists of the mouth, pharynx, radula and salivary glands.[40] The radula is a spiked, tongue-like organ made of chitin.[25] Food is broken down and is forced into the oesophagus by two lateral extensions of the esophageal side walls in addition to the radula. From there it is transferred to the gastrointestinal tract, which is mostly suspended from the roof of the mantle cavity by numerous membranes. The tract consists of a crop, where the food is stored; a stomach, where food is ground down; a caecum where the now sludgy food is sorted into fluids and particles and which plays an important role in absorption; the digestive gland, where liver cells break down and absorb the fluid and become \\"brown bodies\\"; and the intestine, where the accumulated waste is turned into faecal ropes by secretions and blown out of the funnel via the rectum.[40][41]\\r\\nDuring osmoregulation, fluid is added to the pericardia of the branchial hearts. The octopus has two nephridia (equivalent to vertebrate kidneys) which are associated with the branchial hearts; these and their associated ducts connect the pericardial cavities with the mantle cavity. Before reaching the branchial heart, each branch of the vena cava expands to form renal appendages which are in direct contact with the thin-walled nephridium. The urine is first formed in the pericardial cavity, and is modified by excretion, chiefly of ammonia, and selective absorption from the renal appendages, as it is passed along the associated duct and through the nephridiopore into the mantle cavity.[22][42]\\r\\nThe octopus (along with cuttlefish) has the highest brain-to-body mass ratios of all invertebrates, and is also greater than many vertebrates.[43] It has a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is localised in its brain, which is contained in a cartilaginous capsule.[44] Two-thirds of an octopus's neurons are found in the nerve cords of its arms, which show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain.[45] Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organised in their brain via an internal somatotopic map of its body, instead using a nonsomatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates.[46]\\r\\nLike other cephalopods, octopuses can distinguish the polarisation of light. Colour vision appears to vary from species to species, for example being present in O. aegina but absent in O. vulgaris.[47] Researchers believe that opsins in the skin can sense different wavelengths of light and help the creatures choose a coloration that camouflages them, in addition to light input from the eyes.[48] Other researchers hypothesize that cephalopod eyes in species which only have a single photoreceptor protein may use chromatic aberration to turn monochromatic vision into color vision, though this sacrifices image quality.[49] This would explain pupils shaped like the letter U, the letter W, or a dumbbell, as well as explaining the need for colorful mating displays.[50]\\r\\nAttached to the brain are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on the position of the body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An autonomic response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal.[22] Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400?Hz and 1000?Hz, and hears best at 600?Hz.[51]\\r\\nOctopuses also have an excellent sense of touch. The octopus's suction cups are equipped with chemoreceptors so the octopus can taste what it touches. Octopus arms do not become tangled or stuck to each other because the sensors recognise octopus skin and prevent self-attachment.[52]\\r\\nThe arms contain tension sensors so the octopus knows whether its arms are stretched out, but this is not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, and it knows what exact motions were made only by observing the arms visually.[53]\\r\\nThe ink sac of an octopus is located under the digestive gland. A gland attached to the sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is close enough to the funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator.[54] The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour.[55] Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.[31]\\r\\nOctopuses are gonochoric and have a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is associated with the coelom. The testis in males and the ovary in females bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at the gonopore.[22] An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to mature and age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.[56][57]\\r\\nWhen octopuses reproduce, the male uses a specialised arm called a hectocotylus to transfer spermatophores (packets of sperm) from the terminal organ of the reproductive tract (the cephalopod \\"penis\\") into the female's mantle cavity.[58] The hectocotylus in benthic octopuses is usually the third right arm, which has a spoon-shaped depression and modified suckers near the tip. In most species, fertilisation occurs in the mantle cavity.[22]\\r\\nThe reproduction of octopuses has been studied in only a few species. One such species is the giant Pacific octopus, in which courtship is accompanied, especially in the male, by changes in skin texture and colour. The male may cling to the top or side of the female or position himself beside her. There is some speculation that he may first use his hectocotylus to remove any spermatophore or sperm already present in the female. He picks up a spermatophore from his spermatophoric sac with the hectocotylus, inserts it into the female's mantle cavity, and deposits it in the correct location for the species, which in the giant Pacific octopus is the opening of the oviduct. Two spermatophores are transferred in this way; these are about one metre (yard) long, and the empty ends may protrude from the female's mantle.[59] A complex hydraulic mechanism releases the sperm from the spermatophore, and it is stored internally by the female.[22]\\r\\nAbout forty days after mating, the female giant Pacific octopus attaches strings of small fertilised eggs (10,000 to 70,000 in total) to rocks in a crevice or under an overhang. Here she guards and cares for them for about five months (160 days) until they hatch.[59] In colder waters, such as those off of Alaska, it may take as much as 10 months for the eggs to completely develop.[60]:74 The female aerates the eggs and keeps them clean; if left untended, many eggs will not hatch.[61] She does not feed during this time and dies soon afterwards. Males become senescent and die a few weeks after mating.[62]\\r\\nThe eggs have large yolks; cleavage (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, the margins of this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop as part of the foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.[22]\\r\\nMost young octopuses hatch as paralarvae and are planktonic for weeks to months, depending on the species and water temperature. They feed on copepods, arthropod larvae and other zooplankton, eventually settling on the ocean floor and developing directly into adults with no distinct metamorphoses that are present in other groups of mollusc larvae.[22] Octopus species that produce larger eggs ÿ including the southern blue-ringed, Caribbean reef, California two-spot, Eledone moschata[63] and deep sea octopuses ÿ do not have a paralarval stage, but hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults.[60]:74ÿ75[64]\\r\\nIn the argonaut (paper nautilus), the female secretes a fine, fluted, papery shell in which the eggs are deposited and in which she also resides while floating in mid-ocean. In this she broods the young, and it also serves as a buoyancy aid allowing her to adjust her depth. The male argonaut is minute by comparison and has no shell.[65]\\r\\nOctopuses have a relatively short life expectancy; some species live for as little as six months. The giant Pacific octopus, one of the two largest species of octopus, may live for as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation.[66]:276ÿ277 Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.[67]\\r\\nOctopuses live in every ocean, and different species have adapted to different marine habitats. As juveniles, common octopuses inhabit shallow tide pools. The Hawaiian day octopus (Octopus cyanea) lives on coral reefs; argonauts drift in pelagic waters. Abdopus aculeatus mostly lives in near-shore seagrass beds. Some species are adapted to the cold, ocean depths. The spoon-armed octopus (Bathypolypus arcticus) is found in abyssal plains at depths of 1,000?m (3,300?ft), and Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis lives near hydrothermal vents at 2,000?m (6,600?ft).[24] The cirrate species are often free-swimming and live in deep-water habitats.[32] No species are known to live in fresh water.[68]\\r\\nMost species are solitary when not mating,[69] though a few are known to occur in high densities and with frequent interactions, signaling, mate defending and eviction of individuals from dens. This is likely the result of abundant food supplies combined with limited den sites.[70] Octopuses hide in dens, which are typically crevices in rocky outcrops or other hard structures, though some species burrow into sand or mud. Octopuses are not territorial but generally remain in a home range; they may leave the area in search of food. They can use navigation skills to return to a den without having to retrace their outward route.[71] They are not known to be migratory.[72]\\r\\nOctopuses bring captured prey back to the den where they can eat it safely. Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and the den is often surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items. Other creatures, such as fish, crabs, molluscs and echinoderms, often share the den with the octopus, either because they have arrived as scavengers, or because they have survived capture.[73]\\r\\nNearly all octopuses are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, and other molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, fish and other cephalopods.[74] Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that it is likely to reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.[73]\\r\\nA bottom-dwelling octopus typically moves among the rocks and feels through the crevices. The creature may make a jet-propelled pounce on prey and pull it towards the mouth with its arms, the suckers restraining it. Small prey may be completely trapped by the webbed structure. Octopuses usually inject crustaceans like crabs with a paralysing saliva then dismember them with their beaks.[74][75] Octopuses feed on shelled molluscs either by forcing the valves apart, or by drilling a hole in the shell to inject a nerve toxin.[76][75] It used to be thought that the hole was drilled by the radula, but it has now been shown that minute teeth at the tip of the salivary papilla are involved, and an enzyme in the toxic saliva is used to dissolve the calcium carbonate of the shell. It takes about three hours for O. vulgaris to create a 0.6?mm (0.024?in) hole. Once the shell is penetrated, the prey dies almost instantaneously, its muscles relax, and the soft tissues are easy for the octopus to remove. Crabs may also be treated in this way; tough-shelled species are more likely to be drilled, and soft-shelled crabs are torn apart.[77]\\r\\nSome species have other modes of feeding. Grimpoteuthis has a reduced or non-existent radula and swallows prey whole.[31] In the deep-sea genus Stauroteuthis, some of the muscle cells that control the suckers in most species have been replaced with photophores which are believed to fool prey by directing them towards the mouth, making them one of the few bioluminescent octopuses.[78]\\r\\nOctopuses mainly move about by relatively slow crawling, with some swimming in a head-first position. Jet propulsion, or backwards swimming, is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and crawling.[79] When in no hurry, they usually crawl on either solid or soft surfaces. Several arms are extended forwards, some of the suckers adhere to the substrate and the animal hauls itself forwards with its powerful arm muscles, while other arms may push rather than pull. As progress is made, other arms move ahead to repeat these actions and the original suckers detach. During crawling, the heart rate nearly doubles, and the animal requires ten or fifteen minutes to recover from relatively minor exercise.[27]\\r\\nMost octopuses swim by expelling a jet of water from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction.[80] The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.[79]\\r\\nCirrate octopuses cannot produce jet propulsion and rely on their fins for swimming. They have neutral buoyancy and drift through the water with the fins extended. They can also contract their arms and surrounding web to make sudden moves known as \\"take-offs\\". Another form of locomotion is \\"pumping\\", which involves symmetrical contractions of muscles in their webs producing peristaltic waves. This moves the body slowly.[31]\\r\\nIn 2005, Adopus aculeatus and veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) were found to walk on two arms, while at the same time mimicking plant matter.[81] This form of locomotion allows these octopuses to move quickly away from a potential predator without being recognised.[79] A study of this behaviour led to the suggestion that the two rearmost appendages may be more accurately termed \\"legs\\" rather than \\"arms\\".[82] Some species of octopus can crawl out of the water briefly, which they may do between tide pools while hunting crustaceans or gastropods or to escape predators.[83][84] \\"Stilt walking\\" is used by the veined octopus when carrying stacked coconut shells. The octopus carries the shells underneath it with two arms, and progresses with an ungainly gait supported by its remaining arms held rigid.[85]\\r\\nOctopuses are highly intelligent, but the extent of their intelligence and learning capability are not well defined.[86][87][88][89] Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory. It is not known precisely what contribution learning makes to adult octopus behaviour. Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, as adults provide no parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.[60]:75\\r\\nIn laboratory experiments, octopuses can be readily trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They have been reported to practise observational learning,[90] although the validity of these findings is contested.[86][87] Octopuses have also been observed in what has been described as play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them.[91] Octopuses often break out of their aquariums and sometimes into others in search of food.[83][92][93] They have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs.[88] The veined octopus collects discarded coconut shells, then uses them to build a shelter, an example of tool use.[85][94][95]\\r\\nOctopuses use camouflage when hunting, and to avoid predators. To do this they use specialised skin cells which change the appearance of the skin by adjusting its colour, opacity, or reflectivity. Chromatophores contain yellow, orange, red, brown, or black pigments; most species have three of these colours, while some have two or four. Other colour-changing cells are reflective iridophores and white leucophores.[96] This colour-changing ability is also used to communicate with or warn other octopuses.[97]\\r\\nOctopuses can create distracting patterns with waves of dark coloration across the body, a display known as the \\"passing cloud\\". Muscles in the skin change the texture of the mantle to achieve greater camouflage. In some species, the mantle can take on the spiky appearance of algae; in others, skin anatomy is limited to relatively uniform shades of one colour with limited skin texture. Octopuses that are diurnal and live in shallow water have evolved more complex skin than their nocturnal and deep-sea counterparts.[97]\\r\\nAside from humans, octopuses may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, and other cephalopods.[98] Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behaviour.[97] An octopus may spend 40% of its time hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of Enteroctopus dolfleini in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms.[98] The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning.[99] The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Callistoctopus macropus) turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display.[100] Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web to make it look as big and threatening as possible.[101]\\r\\nOnce they have been seen by a predator, they commonly try to escape but can also use distraction with an ink cloud ejected from the ink sac. The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.[102]\\r\\nWhen under attack, some octopuses can perform arm autotomy, in a manner similar to the way skinks and other lizards detach their tails. The crawling arm may distract would-be predators. Such severed arms remain sensitive to stimuli and move away from unpleasant sensations.[103] Octopuses can replace lost limbs.[104]\\r\\nSome octopuses, such as the mimic octopus, can combine their highly flexible bodies with their colour-changing ability to mimic other, more dangerous animals, such as lionfish, sea snakes, and eels.[105][106]\\r\\nThe diseases and parasites that affect octopuses have been little studied, but cephalopods are known to be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and metazoan parasites have been recognised.[107] The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species;[108] it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genus?Aggregata living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an innate immune system, and the haemocytes respond to infection by phagocytosis, encapsulation, infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens. The haemocytes play an important role in the recognition and elimination of foreign bodies and wound repair. Captive animals have been found to be more susceptible to pathogens than wild ones.[109] A gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio lentus, has been found to cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and death of octopuses in extreme cases.[110]\\r\\nCephalopods have existed for 500 million years and octopus ancestors were in the Carboniferous seas 300 million years ago. The oldest known octopus fossil is Pohlsepia, which lived 296 million years ago. Researchers have identified impressions of eight arms, two eyes, and possibly an ink sac.[111] Octopuses are mostly soft tissue, and so fossils are relatively rare. Octopuses, squids and cuttlefish belong to the clade Coleoidea. They are known as \\"soft-bodied\\" cephalopods, lacking the external shell of most molluscs and other cephalopods like the Nautiloids and the extinct Ammonoidea.[112] Octopuses have eight arms like other coleoids but lack the extra specialised feeding appendages known as tentacles which are longer and thinner with suckers only at their club-like ends.[113][114][115] The vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis) also lacks tentacles but has sensory filaments.[116]\\r\\nTwo possible extant cephalopod phylogenies, based on genetics studies by Strugnell et al. 2007, are shown in the possible cladograms.[117]\\r\\nNautilus \\r\\nOctopods \\r\\nVampyroteuthis \\r\\nSquids and cuttlefish \\r\\nNautilus \\r\\nSquids and cuttlefish \\r\\nVampyroteuthis \\r\\nOctopods \\r\\nThe scientific name Octopoda was first coined and given as the order of octopuses in 1818 by English biologist William Elford Leach,[118] who classified them as Octopoida the previous year.[2] The Octopoda consists of around 300 known species[119] and can be divided into two suborders, the Incirrina and the Cirrina. The incirrate octopuses (the majority of species) lack the cirri and paired swimming fins of the cirrates.[32] In addition, the internal shell of incirrates is either present as a pair of stylets or absent altogether.[120]\\r\\nOctopuses and other coleoid cephalopods are capable of greater RNA editing (which involves changes to the nucleic acid sequence of the primary transcript of RNA molecules) than any other organisms. Editing is concentrated in the nervous system and affects proteins involved in neural excitability and neuronal morphology. More than 60% of RNA transcripts for coleoid brains are recoded by editing, compared to less than 1% for a human or fruit fly. Coleoids rely mostly on ADAR enzymes for RNA editing, which requires large double-stranded RNA structures to flank to the editing sites. Both the structures and editing sites are conserved in the coleoid genome and the mutation rates for the sites are severely hampered. Hence, greater transcriptome plasticity has come as the cost of slower genome evolution. High levels of RNA editing do not appear to be present in more basal cephalopods or other molluscs.[122][123]\\r\\nAncient seafaring people were aware of the octopus, as evidenced by certain artworks and designs. For example, a stone carving found in the archaeological recovery from Bronze Age Minoan Crete at Knossos (1900 ÿ 1100 BC) has a depiction of a fisherman carrying an octopus.[124] The terrifyingly powerful Gorgon of Greek mythology has been thought to have been inspired by the octopus or squid, the octopus itself representing the severed head of Medusa, the beak as the protruding tongue and fangs, and its tentacles as the snakes.[125] The Kraken are legendary sea monsters of giant proportions said to dwell off the coasts of Norway and Greenland, usually portrayed in art as a giant octopus attacking ships. Linnaeus included it in the first edition of his 1735 Systema Naturae.[126][127] A Hawaiian creation myth says that the present cosmos is the last of a series which arose in stages from the ruins of the previous universe. In this account, the octopus is the lone survivor of the previous, alien universe.[128] The Akkorokamui is a gigantic octopus-like monster from Ainu folklore.[129]\\r\\nA battle with an octopus plays a significant role in Victor Hugo's book Travailleurs de la mer (Toilers of the Sea), relating to his time in exile on Guernsey.[130] Ian Fleming's 1966 short story collection Octopussy and The Living Daylights, and the 1983 James Bond film were partly inspired by Hugo's book.[131]\\r\\nJapanese erotic art, shunga, includes ukiyo-e woodblock prints such as Katsushika Hokusai's 1814 print Tako to ama (The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife), in which an ama diver is sexually intertwined with a large and a small octopus.[132][133] The print is a forerunner of tentacle erotica.[134] The biologist P. Z. Myers noted in his science blog, Pharyngula, that octopuses appear in \\"extraordinary\\" graphic illustrations involving women, tentacles, and bare breasts.[135][136]\\r\\nSince it has numerous arms emanating from a common centre, the octopus is often used as a symbol for a powerful and manipulative organisation, usually negatively.[137]\\r\\nOctopuses generally avoid humans, but incidents have been verified. For example, a 2.4-metre (8?ft) Pacific octopus, said to be nearly perfectly camouflaged, \\"lunged\\" at a diver and \\"wrangled\\" over his camera before it let go. Another diver recorded the encounter on video.[138]\\r\\nAll species are venomous, but only blue-ringed octopuses have venom that is lethal to humans.[139] Bites are reported each year across the animals' range from Australia to the eastern Indo-Pacific Ocean. They bite only when provoked or accidentally stepped upon; bites are small and usually painless. The venom appears to be able to penetrate the skin without a puncture, given prolonged contact. It contains tetrodotoxin, which causes paralysis by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. This causes death by respiratory failure leading to cerebral anoxia. No antidote is known, but if breathing can be kept going artificially, patients recover within 24 hours.[140][141] Bites have been recorded from captive octopuses of other species; they leave swellings which disappear in a day or two.[142]\\r\\nOctopus fisheries exist around the world with total catches varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995.[143] The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012.[144] Methods to capture octopuses include pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection.[143] Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts.[145][146] The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are eaten in several countries around the world, including the US.[147][148] Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice on the basis that octopuses can experience pain.[149] Octopuses have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility.[150]\\r\\nIn classical Greece, Aristotle (384 ÿ 322 BC) commented on the colour-changing abilities of the octopus, both for camouflage and for signalling, in his Historia animalium: \\"The octopus?... seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it; it does so also when alarmed.\\"[151] Aristotle noted that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm and suggested it might be used in sexual reproduction. This claim was widely disbelieved until the 19th century. It was described in 1829 by the French zoologist Georges Cuvier, who supposed it to be a parasitic worm, naming it as a new species, Hectocotylus octopodis.[152][153] Other zoologists thought it a spermatophore; the German zoologist Heinrich Mller believed it was \\"designed\\" to detach during copulation. In 1856 the Danish zoologist Japetus Steenstrup demonstrated that it is used to transfer sperm, and only rarely detaches.[154]\\r\\nOctopuses offer many possibilities in biological research, including their ability to regenerate limbs, change the colour of their skin, behave intelligently with a distributed nervous system, and make use of 168 kinds of protocadherins (humans have 58), the proteins that guide the connections neurons make with each other. The California two-spot octopus has had its genome sequenced, allowing exploration of its molecular adaptations.[155] Having independently evolved mammal-like intelligence, octopuses have been compared to hypothetical intelligent extraterrestrials.[156] Their problem-solving skills, along with their mobility and lack of rigid structure enable them to escape from supposedly secure tanks in laboratories and public aquariums.[157]\\r\\nDue to their intelligence, octopuses are listed in some countries as experimental animals on which surgery may not be performed without anesthesia, a protection usually extended only to vertebrates. In the UK from 1993 to 2012, the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) was the only invertebrate protected under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.[158] In 2012, this legislation was extended to include all cephalopods[159] in accordance with a general EU directive.[160]\\r\\nSome robotics research is exploring biomimicry of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 a team in Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation.[161] In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.[162]","input":"How many different kinds of octopuses are there?"},{"output":"Seeking to pre-empt the French colonial empire from expanding into the region","context":"Between 1788 and 1868, about 162,000 convicts were transported by the British government to various penal colonies in Australia.[1]\\r\\nThe British government began transporting convicts overseas to American colonies in the early 17th century. When transportation ended with the start of the American Revolution, an alternative site was needed to relieve further overcrowding of British prisons and hulks. Earlier in 1770, James Cook charted and claimed possession of the east coast of Australia for Britain. Seeking to pre-empt the French colonial empire from expanding into the region, Britain chose Australia as the site of a penal colony, and in 1787, the First Fleet of eleven convict ships set sail for Botany Bay, arriving on 20 January 1788 to found Sydney, New South Wales, the first European settlement on the continent. Other penal colonies were later established in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) in 1803 and Queensland in 1824, while Western Australia, founded in 1829 as a free colony, received convicts from 1850. Victoria and South Australia remained free colonies. Penal transportation to Australia peaked in the 1830s and dropped off significantly the following decade. The last convict ship arrived in Western Australia on 10 January 1868.\\r\\nMany convicts were transported for petty crimes, while a significant number were political prisoners. More serious crimes, such as rape and murder, were punishable by death, and therefore not transportable offences. Once emancipated, most ex-convicts stayed in Australia and joined the free settlers, with some rising to prominent positions in Australian society. However, convictism carried a social stigma, and for some later Australians, convict origins would be a source of shame. Attitudes became more accepting in the 20th century and it is now considered by many Australians to be a cause for celebration to have a convict in one's lineage. Around 20% of modern Australians are descended from transported convicts.[2] The convict era has inspired famous novels, films, and other cultural works, and the extent to which it has shaped Australia's national character has been studied by many writers and historians.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore, the population of England and Wales, which had remained steady at 6 million from 1700 to 1740, began rising considerably after 1740. By the time of the American Revolution, London was overcrowded, filled with the unemployed, and flooded with cheap gin.[4] Poverty, social injustice, child labor, harsh and dirty living conditions and long working hours were prevalent in 19th-century Britain. Dickens' novels perhaps best illustrate this; even some government officials were horrified by what they saw. Only in 1833 and 1844 were the first general laws against child labour (the Factory Acts) passed in the United Kingdom.[5] Crime had become a major problem and in 1784 a French observer noted that \\"from sunset to dawn the environs of London became the patrimony of brigands for twenty miles around.\\"[6]\\r\\nEach parish had a watchman, but British cities did not have police forces in the modern sense. Jeremy Bentham avidly promoted the idea of a circular prison, but the penitentiary was seen by many government officials as a peculiar American concept. Virtually all malefactors were caught by informers or denounced to the local court by their victims.[citation needed] Pursuant to the so-called \\"Bloody Code\\", by the 1770s there were 222 crimes in Britain which carried the death penalty,[7] almost all of which were crimes against property. These included such offences as the stealing of goods worth over 5 shillings, the cutting down of a tree, the theft of an animal, even the theft of a rabbit from a rabbit warren.\\r\\nThe Industrial Revolution led to an increase in petty crime due to the economic displacement of much of the population, building pressure on the government to find an alternative to confinement in overcrowded gaols. The situation was so dire that hulks left over from the Seven Years' War were used as makeshift floating prisons.[8] Eight of every 10 prisoners were in jail for theft. The Bloody Code was gradually rescinded in the 1800s because judges and juries considered its punishments too harsh. Since lawmakers still wanted punishments to deter potential criminals, they increasingly applied transportation as a more humane alternative to execution.[9] Transportation had been employed as a punishment for both major and petty crimes since the seventeenth century. Around 60,000 convicts were transported to the British colonies in North America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Transportation to the Americas ceased following Britain's defeat in the American Revolutionary War. The number of convicts transported to North America is not verified although it has been estimated to be 50,000 by John Dunmore Lang and 120,000 by Thomas Keneally. The British American colony of Maryland received a larger felon quota than any other province.[10]\\r\\nAlternatives to the American colonies were investigated and the newly discovered and mapped East Coast of New Holland was proposed. The details provided by James Cook during his expedition to the South Pacific in 1770 made it the most suitable.\\r\\nOn 18 August 1786 the decision was made to send a colonisation party of convicts, military, and civilian personnel to Botany Bay under the command of Admiral Arthur Phillip who was to be the Governor of the new colony. There were 775 convicts on board six transport ships. They were accompanied by officials, members of the crew, marines, the families thereof and their own children who together totaled 645. In all, eleven ships were sent in what became known as the First Fleet. Other than the convict transports, there were two naval escorts and three storeships. The fleet assembled in Portsmouth and set sail on 13 May 1787.[11]\\r\\nThe fleet arrived at Botany Bay on 20 January 1788. It soon became clear that it would not be suitable for the establishment of a colony due to \\"the openness of this bay, and the dampness of the soil, by which the people would probably be rendered unhealthy\\" and Philip decided to examine Port Jackson, a bay mentioned by Captain Cook, about three leagues to the north. On 22 January a small expedition led by Phillips sailed to Port Jackson, arriving in the early afternoon:[11]\\r\\nHere all regret arising from the former disappointments was at once obliterated; and Governor Phillip had the satisfaction to find one of the finest harbours in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line might ride in perfect security. The different coves of this harbour were examined with all possible expedition, and the preference was given to one which had the finest spring of water, and in which ships can anchor so close to the shore, that at a very small expence quays may be constructed at which the largest vessels may unload. This cove is about half a mile in length, and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance. In honour of Lord Sydney, the Governor distinguished it by the name of Sydney Cove.[11]\\r\\nThere they established the first permanent European colony on the Australian continent, New South Wales, on 26 January. The area has since developed into the city of Sydney. This date is still celebrated as Australia Day.\\r\\nThere was initially a high mortality rate amongst the members of the first fleet due mainly to shortages of food. The ships carried only enough food to provide for the settlers until they could establish agriculture in the region. Unfortunately, there were an insufficient number of skilled farmers and domesticated livestock to do this, and the colony waited on the arrival of the Second Fleet. The second fleet was an unprecedented disaster that provided little in the way of help and upon its delivery in June 1790 of still more sick and dying convicts, which actually worsened the situation in Port Jackson.\\r\\nLieutenant-General Sir Richard Bourke was the ninth Governor of the Colony of New South Wales between 1831 and 1837. Appalled by the excessive punishments doled out to convicts, Bourke passed 'The Magistrates Act', which limited the sentence a magistrate could pass to fifty lashes (previously there was no such limit). Bourke's administration was controversial, and furious magistrates and employers petitioned the crown against this interference with their legal rights, fearing that a reduction in punishments would cease to provide enough deterrence to the convicts.\\r\\nBourke, however, was not dissuaded from his reforms and continued to create controversy within the colony by combating the inhumane treatment handed out to convicts, including limiting the number of convicts each employer was allowed to seventy, as well as granting rights to freed convicts, such as allowing the acquisition of property and service on juries. It has been argued that the suspension of convict transportation to New South Wales in 1840[12] can be attributed to the actions of Bourke and other men like Australian-born lawyer William Charles Wentworth. It took another 10 years, but transportation to the colony of New South Wales was finally officially abolished on 1 October 1850.[13]\\r\\nIf a convict was well behaved, the convict could be given a ticket of leave, granting some freedom. At the end of the convict's sentence, seven years in most cases, the convict was issued with a Certificate of Freedom. He was then free to become a settler or to return to England. Convicts who misbehaved, however, were often sent to a place of secondary punishment like Port Arthur, Tasmania or Norfolk Island, where they would suffer additional punishment and solitary confinement.\\r\\nWithin a month of the arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove, a group of convicts and free settlers were sent to take control of Norfolk Island, a small island 1,412 kilometres (877?mi) east of the coast of New South Wales. More convicts were sent, and many of them proved to be unruly; early 1789 saw a failed attempt to overthrow Lieutenant Philip Gidley King, the island's commandant. This was followed by the wreck of the HMS Sirius on one of the island's reefs while attempting to land stores.\\r\\nIn 1803, a British expedition was sent from Sydney to Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land) to establish a new penal colony there. The small party, led by Lt. John Bowen, established a settlement at Risdon Cove, on the eastern side of the Derwent River. Originally sent to Port Philip, but abandoned within weeks, another expedition led by Lieutenant-Colonel David Collins arrived soon after. Collins considered the Risdon Cove site inadequate, and in 1804 he established an alternative settlement on the western side of the river at Sullivan's Cove, Tasmania. This later became known as Hobart, and the original settlement at Risdon Cove was deserted. Collins became the first Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land.\\r\\nWhen the convict station on Norfolk Island was abandoned in 1807-1808, the remaining convicts and free settlers were transported to Hobart and allocated land for re-settlement. However, as the existing small population was already experiencing difficulties producing enough food, the sudden doubling of the population was almost catastrophic.\\r\\nStarting in 1816, more free settlers began arriving from Great Britain. On 3 December 1825 Tasmania was declared a colony separate from New South Wales, with a separate administration.\\r\\nThe Macquarie Harbour penal colony on the West Coast of Tasmania was established in 1820 to exploit the valuable timber Huon Pine growing there for furniture making and shipbuilding. Macquarie Harbour had the added advantage of being almost impossible to escape from, most attempts ending with the convicts either drowning, dying of starvation in the bush, or (on at least two occasions) turning cannibal. Convicts sent to this settlement had usually re-offended during their sentence of transportation, and were treated very harshly, labouring in cold and wet weather, and subjected to severe corporal punishment for minor infractions.\\r\\nIn 1830, the Port Arthur penal settlement was established to replace Macquarie Harbour, as it was easier to maintain regular communications by sea. Although known in popular history as a particularly harsh prison, in reality its management was far more humane than Macquarie Harbour or the outlying stations of New South Wales. Experimentation with the so-called model prison system took place in Port Arthur. Solitary confinement was the preferred method of punishment.\\r\\nMany changes were made to the manner in which convicts were handled in the general population, largely responsive to British public opinion on the harshness of their treatment. Until the late 1830s most convicts were either retained by Government for public works or assigned to private individuals as a form of indentured labour. From the early 1840s the Probation System was employed, where convicts spent an initial period, usually two years, in public works gangs on stations outside of the main settlements, then were freed to work for wages within a set district.\\r\\nTransportation to Tasmania ended in 1853 (see section below on Cessation of Transportation).\\r\\nIn 1803 two ships arrived in Port Phillip, which Lt. John Murray in the Lady Nelson had discovered and named the previous year. The Calcutta under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Collins transported 300 convicts, accompanied by the supply ship Ocean. Collins had previously been Judge Advocate with the First Fleet in 1788. He chose Sullivan Bay near the present-day Sorrento, Victoria for the first settlement - some 90?km south of present-day Melbourne. About two months later the settlement was abandoned due to poor soil and water shortages and Collins moved the convicts to Hobart. Several convicts had escaped into the bush and were left behind to unknown fates with the local aboriginal people. One such convict, the subsequently celebrated William Buckley, lived in the western side of Port Phillip for the next 32 years before approaching the new settlers and assisting as an interpreter for the indigenous peoples.\\r\\nA second settlement was established at Westernport Bay, on the site of present-day Corinella, in November of 1826. It comprised an initial 20 soldiers and 22 convicts, with another 12 convicts arriving subsequently. This settlement was abandoned in February 1828, and all convicts returned to Sydney.[14]\\r\\nThe Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned in 1837 following the landing of the Henty brothers in Portland Bay in 1834, and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne.\\r\\nBetween 1844 and 1849 about 1,750 convicts arrived there from England. They were referred to either as \\"Exiles\\" or the \\"Pentonvillians\\" because most of them came from Pentonville Probationary Prison. Unlike earlier convicts who were required to work for the government or on hire from penal depots, the Exiles were free to work for pay, but could not leave the district to which they were assigned. The Port Phillip District was still part of New South Wales at this stage. Victoria separated from New South Wales and became an independent colony in 1851.\\r\\nIn 1823 John Oxley sailed north from Sydney to inspect Port Curtis and Moreton Bay as possible sites for a penal colony. At Moreton Bay he found the Brisbane River, which Cook had guessed would exist, and explored the lower part of it. In September 1824, he returned with soldiers and established a temporary settlement at Redcliffe. On 2 December 1824, the settlement was transferred to where the Central Business District (CBD) of Brisbane now stands. The settlement was at first called Edenglassie. In 1839 transportation of convicts to Moreton Bay ceased and the Brisbane penal settlement was closed. In 1842 free settlement was permitted and people began to colonize the area voluntarily. On 6 June 1859 Queensland became a colony separate from New South Wales.\\r\\nAlthough a convict-supported settlement was established in Western Australia from 1826 to 1831, direct transportation of convicts did not begin until 1850. It continued until 1868. During that period, 9,668 convicts were transported on 43 convict ships. The first convicts to arrive were transported to New South Wales, and sent by that colony to King George Sound (Albany) in 1826 to help establish a settlement there. At that time the western third of Australia was unclaimed land known as New Holland. Fears that France would lay claim to the land prompted the Governor of New South Wales, Ralph Darling, to send Major Edmund Lockyer, with troops and 23 convicts, to establish a settlement at King George Sound. Lockyer's party arrived on Christmas Day, 1826. A convict presence was maintained at the settlement for over four years. On 7 March 1831 control of the settlement was transferred to the Swan River Colony, and the troops and convicts were withdrawn.[15]\\r\\nIn April 1848, Charles Fitzgerald, Governor of Western Australia, petitioned Britain to send convicts to his state because of labor shortages. Britain rejected sending fixed term convicts, but offered to send first offenders in the final years of their terms.\\r\\nMost convicts in Western Australia spent very little time in prison. Those who were stationed at Fremantle were housed in the Convict Establishment, the colony's convict prison, and misbehaviour was punished by stints there. The majority, however, were stationed in other parts of the colony. Although there was no convict assignment in Western Australia, there was a great demand for public infrastructure throughout the colony, so that many convicts were stationed in remote areas. Initially, most offenders were set to work creating infrastructure for the convict system, including the construction of the Convict Establishment itself.\\r\\nIn 1852 a Convict Depot was built at Albany, but closed 3 years later. When shipping increased the Depot was re-opened. Most of the convicts had their Ticket-of-Leave and were hired to work by the free settlers. Convicts also manned the pilot boat, rebuilt York Street and Stirling Terrace; and the track from Albany to Perth was made into a good road. An Albany newspaper noted their commendable behaviour and wrote, \\"There were instances in which our free settlers might take an example\\".\\r\\nWestern Australia's convict era came to an end with the cessation of penal transportation by Britain. In May 1865, the colony was advised of the change in British policy, and told that Britain would send one convict ship in each of the years 1865, 1866 and 1867, after which transportation would cease. In accordance with this, the last convict ship to Western Australia, the Hougoumont, left Britain in 1867 and arrived in Western Australia on 10 January 1868.\\r\\nApproximately 20% of the transportees were women. For protection, most quickly attached themselves to male officers or convicts. Although they were routinely referred to as courtesans, relatively few had been prostitutes in England as prostitution, like murder, was not a transportable offence.[16]\\r\\nPolitical prisoners made up a small proportion of convicts. They arrived in waves corresponding to political unrest in Britain and Ireland. They included the First Scottish Martyrs in 1794; British Naval Mutineers (from the Nore Mutiny) in 1797 and 1801; Irish rebels in 1798, 1803, 1848 and 1868; Scots Rebels (1820); Yorkshire Rebels (1820 and 1822); leaders of the Merthyr Tydfil rising of 1831; the Tolpuddle Martyrs (1834); Swing Rioters and Luddites (1828ÿ1833); American and French-Canadian prisoners from the Upper Canada rebellion and Lower Canada Rebellion (1839), and Chartists (1842).[17]\\r\\nWith increasing numbers of free settlers entering New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) by the mid-1830s, opposition to the transportation of felons into the colonies grew. The most influential spokesmen were newspaper proprietors who were also members of the Independent Congregation Church such as John Fairfax in Sydney and the Reverend John West in Launceston, who argued against convicts both as competition to honest free labourers and as the source of crime and vice within the colony. Bishop Bernard Ullathorne, a Catholic prelate who had been in Australia since 1832 returned for a visit to England in 1835. While there he was called upon by the government to give evidence before a Parliamentary Commission on the evils of transportation, and at their request wrote and submitted a tract on the subject. His views in conjunction with others in the end prevailed. The anti-transportation movement was seldom concerned with the inhumanity of the system, but rather the hated stain it was believed to inflict on the free (non-emancipist) middle classes.\\r\\nTransportation to New South Wales ended in 1840, by which time some 150,000 convicts had been sent to the colonies. The sending of convicts to Brisbane in its Moreton Bay district had ceased the previous year, and administration of Norfolk Island was later transferred to Van Diemen's Land.\\r\\nThe continuation of transportation to Van Diemen's Land saw the rise of a well-coordinated anti-transportation movement, especially following a severe economic depression in the early 1840s. Transportation was temporarily suspended in 1846 but soon revived with overcrowding of British gaols and clamour for the availability of transportation as a deterrent. By the late 1840s most convicts being sent to Van Diemen's Land (plus those to Victoria) were designated as \\"exiles\\" and were free to work for pay while under sentence. In 1850 the Australasian Anti-Transportation League was formed to lobby for the permanent cessation of transportation, its aims being furthered by the commencement of the Australian gold rushes the following year. The last convict ship to be sent from England, the St. Vincent, arrived in 1853, and on 10 August Jubilee festivals in Hobart and Launceston celebrated 50 years of European settlement with the official end of transportation.\\r\\nTransportation continued in small numbers to Western Australia. The last convict ship, the Hougoumont, left Britain in 1867 and arrived in Western Australia on 10 January 1868. In all, about 164,000 convicts were transported to the Australian colonies between 1788 and 1868 on board 806 ships. Convicts were made up of English and Welsh (70%), Irish (24%), Scottish (5%) and the remaining 1% from the British outposts in India and Canada, Maoris from New Zealand, Chinese from Hong Kong and slaves from the Caribbean.\\r\\nOnly South Australia and the Northern Territory had never accepted convicts directly from England but they still accepted ex-convicts from the other states. Many convicts were allowed to travel as far as New Zealand to make a new life after being given limited freedom, even if they were not allowed to return home to England. At this time the Australian population was approximately 1 million and the colonies could now sustain themselves without the need for convict labour.[18]\\r\\nIn 2010, UNESCO inscribed 11 Australian Convict Sites on its World Heritage List. The listing recognises the sites as \\"the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts.\\"[19]\\r\\nConvict George Barrington is (perhaps apocryphally) recorded as having written the prologue for the first theatrical play performed by convicts in Australia, one year after the First Fleet's arrival. It is known as \\"Our Country's Good\\", based on the now-famous closing stanza:\\r\\nThe poems of Frank the Poet are among the few surviving literary works done by a convict while still incarcerated. His best-known work is \\"A Convict's Tour of Hell\\". A version of the convict ballad \\"Moreton Bay\\", detailing the brutal punishments meted out by commandment Patrick Logan and his death at the hands of Aborigines, is also attributed to Frank. Other convict ballads include \\"Jim Jones at Botany Bay\\". The ballad \\"Botany Bay\\", which describes the sadness felt by convicts forced to leave their loved ones in England, was written at least 40 years after the end of transportation.\\r\\nPerhaps the most famous convict in all of fiction is Abel Magwitch, a main character of Charles Dickens' 1861 novel Great Expectations. The most famous convict novel is Marcus Clarke's For the Term of His Natural Life (1874), followed by John Boyle O'Reilly's Moondyne (1879). Thomas Keneally explores the convict era in his novels Bring Larks and Heroes (1967) and The Playmaker (1987). Convicts feature heavily in Patrick White's take on the Eliza Fraser story, the 1976 novel A Fringe of Leaves. Convictism is canvassed in Bryce Courtenay's \\"Australian trilogy\\": The Potato Factory (1995), Tommo & Hawk (1997) and Solomon's Song (1999). The title character of Peter Carey's 1997 novel Jack Maggs is a reworking of Dickens' Magwitch character. Many modern works of Tasmanian Gothic focus on the state's convict past, including Gould's Book of Fish (2001) by Richard Flanagan, a fictionalised account of convict artist William Buelow Gould's imprisonment at Macquarie Harbour. Kate Grenville based the novel The Secret River (2005) on the life of her convict ancestor Solomon Wiseman.\\r\\nAlong with bushrangers and other stock characters of colonial life, convicts were a popular subject during Australia's silent film era. The first convict film was a 1908 adaptiation of Marcus Clarke's For the Term of His Natural Life, shot on location at Port Arthur with an unheard-of budget of S7000.[20] This was followed by two more films inspired by Clarke's novel: The Life of Rufus Dawes (1911), which draws on Alfred Dampier's stage production of His Natural Life, and the landmark For the Term of His Natural Life (1927), one of the most expensive silent films ever made.[20] W. J. Lincoln directed many convict melodramas including It Is Never Too Late to Mend (1911), an adaptation of Charles Reade's 1856 novel about cruelties of the convict system; Moodyne (1913), based on John Boyle O'Reilly's novel; and Transported (1913). Other early titles include Sentenced for Life, The Mark of the Lash, One Hundred Years Ago, The Lady Outlaw and The Assigned Servant, all released in 1911. Few convict films were made after 1930; even the Australian New Wave of the 1970s, with its emphasis on Australia's colonial past, largely avoided the convict era in favour of nostalgic period pieces set in the bush around the time of Federation. One exception is Journey Among Women (1977), a feminist imagining of what life was like for convict women.[20] Alexander Pearce, the infamous Tasmanian convict and cannibal, is the inspiration for The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce (2008), Dying Breed (2008) and Van Diemen's Land (2009).","input":"Why did britain made australia a penal colony?"},{"output":"on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina","context":"Santa Elena, a Spanish settlement on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina, was the capital of Spanish Florida from 1566 to 1587. It was established under Pedro Menndez de Avils, the first governor of Spanish Florida.[1][2] There had been a number of earlier attempts to establish colonies in the area by both the Spanish and the French, who had been inspired by earlier accounts of the plentiful land of Chicora.[3] Menndez's Santa Elena settlement was intended as the new capital of the Spanish colony of La Florida, shifting the focus of Spanish colonial efforts north from St. Augustine, which had been established in 1565 to oust the French from their colony of Fort Caroline. Santa Elena was ultimately built at the site of the abandoned French outpost of Charlesfort, founded in 1562 by Jean Ribault.\\r\\nSanta Elena followed the destruction of the French Fort Caroline by Menndez in 1565. The settlement housed a sizeable community, and became the base of operations for the Jesuits and military working in the northern zone of Spanish Florida. From this base the Spanish founded a number of other ephemeral forts as far inland as the Appalachian Mountains, but resistance from local Native American tribes and the lack of interest of Spain in the area, caused these to be abandoned, relocated or destroyed. Santa Elena was ultimately abandoned in 1587, with its survivors relocating to St. Augustine. The Spanish never pressed their colonial claims to the area again, focusing on other areas of the American continent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInterest in the area was piqued following exploration of some part of what is now the coastal southeastern United States by Francisco Gordillo and Pedro de Quejo in 1521. Accounts of the region's abundance from Quejo and Francisco de Chicora, one of the 70 Indians the expedition brought to Hispaniola, inspired Lucas Vzquez de Ayll܇n to establish the short-lived colony of San Miguel de Gualdape. This was abandoned after only a few months. In 1540 Hernando de Soto's expedition found European goods in the wealthy town of Cofitachequi, and thus determined they were near the site of Ayll܇n's colony; their accounts of the wealthy land inspired further colonial ambitions. In 1559, Tristn de Luna y Arellano established a settlement at present-day Pensacola, Florida as a base for future colonization of Santa Elena, but this mission failed. The French also heard the early accounts and took an interest in the area; in 1562 Jean Ribault came to Parris Island and set up the short-lived settlement of Charlesfort there. However, this was abandoned the following year.[4]\\r\\nGovernor Pedro Menndez de Avils founded St. Augustine in 1565 in response to the establishment of the French Fort Caroline, in what is now Jacksonville, Florida, by Ren Goulaine de Laudonnire the previous year. Menndez burned Fort Caroline and dislodged the French from Florida. In 1566 the Spanish shifted their efforts back to colonizing Santa Elena, and a settlement was founded in 1566. Menndez then ordered an expedition, led by Captain Juan Pardo, to go from Santa Elena to the interior of North America. Pardo's mission was to pacify and convert the natives and find an overland route to silver mines in Mexico.[5] In December, 1566, a contingent of 125 men left on the first of two Pardo expeditions inland; with one fort constructed in eastern Tennessee.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Pardo expedition created the first Spanish and European settlement in the interior of what became North Carolina. Juan Pardo led his men to Joara, a large regional center of the Mississippian culture near present-day Morganton. Pardo renamed the village Cuenca, as he claimed it for Spain. The Spanish built Fort San Juan and made a base there for the winter. Pardo left a contingent of 30 men. In an expedition the following year, Pardo went on to build five more forts, leaving garrisons down the Appalachian spine. He returned to Santa Elena without going back through Joara. After 18 months, the natives attacked the soldiers, killing all but one of the 120 at the various forts and burning all the forts. The Spanish never returned to press their colonial claim in the interior.[6]\\r\\nIn 1576, natives of nearby Orista and Escamacu settlements burned Santa Elena. The Spanish abandoned Fort San Felipe, which was also burned. A year later, the Spanish returned and rebuilt the settlement, at the same time constructing a new battlement named Fort San Marcos. In 1580, the Spanish repelled an attack by 2,000 natives.[7] After nearly a decade, in the latter half of 1587, the Spanish retreated to present-day Florida, lost interest in the area, and totally abandoned Santa Elena deciding to focus on colonizing other areas of the continent. The Escamacu people, who converted to Roman Catholicism before the Spaniards abandoned the site in 1587, kept their religion, and survived as a tribe into the early 17th century. After that their survivors were assimilated into larger tribes.\\r\\nDuring its 21 years of Spanish occupation, Santa Elena was home to a series of fortifications, including Fort San Salvador, built by Menndez in 1566, Fort San Felipe, established after the arrival of additional troops and supplies, and Fort San Marcos, erected during the second occupation at Santa Elena. In recent years, the site of Santa Elena has been extensively studied through archaeological investigation.[8][9]\\r\\nCoordinates: 321823N 804032W? / ?32.3063N 80.6755W? / 32.3063; -80.6755","input":"Where was the spanish settlement santa elena located?"},{"output":"around 720 BCE","context":"According to the Hebrew Bible, the Kingdom of Israel (Hebrew: ????????? ???????????, Modern?Mamlekhet Yisra'el, Tiberian?Maml?e?

Historians often refer to the Kingdom of Israel as the \\"Northern Kingdom\\" or as the \\"Kingdom of Samaria\\" to differentiate it from the Southern Kingdom of Judah.\\r\\nModern scholarship, incorporating textual criticism and archaeology, has challenged the biblical account that the northern kingdom of Israel broke off from a united monarchy with the southern kingdom of Judah, suggesting instead that the northern civilization of Israel developed independently of Judah (a comparatively small and rural area), and that it first reached the political, economic, military and architectural sophistication of a kingdom under the Omride dynasty around 884 BCE.[1]:169ÿ195[2][3]\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Israel existed roughly from 930 BCE until 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The major cities of the kingdom were Shechem, Tirzah, and Shomron (Samaria).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the Kingdom of Israel has been referred to as the \\"House of Joseph\\".[4][5] It is also frequently referenced (particularly in poetry) as Ephraim, the tribe whose territory housed the capital cities and the royal families. It has also been referred to as \\"Israel in Samaria\\".[6]\\r\\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the territory of the Kingdom of Israel comprised the territories of the tribes of Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, Dan, Manasseh, Ephraim, Reuben and Gad. Its capital was Samaria according to the Book of Isaiah.\\r\\nThe United Kingdom of Israel and Judah is said to have existed from about 1030 to about 930 BCE. It was a union of all the twelve Israelite tribes living in the area that presently approximates modern Israel and the other Levantine territories including much of western Jordan, and western Syria\\r\\nAfter the death of Solomon in about 931 BCE, all the Israelite tribes except for Judah and Benjamin (called the ten northern tribes) refused to accept Rehoboam, the son and successor of Solomon, as their king.[7] The rebellion against Rehoboam arose after he refused to lighten the burden of taxation and services that his father had imposed on his subjects.[8]\\r\\nJeroboam, who was not of the Davidic line, was sent for from Egypt by the malcontents.[9] The Tribe of Ephraim and all Israel raised the old cry, \\"Every man to his tents, O Israel\\".[10] Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem,[11][12] and in 930 BCE (some date it in 920 BCE), Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all Israel at Shechem. After the revolt at Shechem at first only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David. But very soon after the tribe of Benjamin joined Judah. The northern kingdom continued to be called the Kingdom of Israel or Israel, while the southern kingdom was called the kingdom of Judah. 2 Chronicles 15:9[13] also says that members of the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon fled to Judah during the reign of Asa of Judah.\\r\\nBoth Eusebius and Josephus place the division in 997 BCE ÿ lunar dates of Venus can be mistaken as 64 years later (c. 930 BCE). (Crossing of sun over Mars as Tamuz would be 10 July 997 BCE.)\\r\\nShechem was the first capital of the Kingdom of Israel.[14] Afterwards it was Tirzah.[15] King Omri built his capital in Samaria (1 Kings 16:24), which continued as such until the destruction of the Kingdom by the Assyrians (2 Kings 17:5). During the three-year siege of Samaria by the Assyrians, Shalmaneser V died and was succeeded by Sargon II of Assyria, who himself records the capture of that city thus: \\"Samaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away\\" into Assyria. Thus, around 720 BCE, after two centuries, the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an end.\\r\\nToday, among archaeologists, Samaria is one of the most universally accepted archaeological sites from the biblical period[16] At around 850 BCE, the Mesha Stele, written in Old Hebrew alphabet, records a victory of King Mesha of Moab against king Omri of Israel and his son Ahab.[17]\\r\\nFor the first sixty years, the kings of Judah tried to re-establish their authority over the northern kingdom, and there was perpetual war between them. For the following eighty years, there was no open war between them, and, for the most part, they were in friendly alliance, co-operating against their common enemies, especially against Damascus.\\r\\nThe conflict between Israel and Judah was resolved when Jehoshaphat, King of Judah, allied himself with the house of Ahab through marriage. Later, Jehosophat's son and successor, Jehoram of Judah, married Ahab's daughter Athaliah, cementing the alliance. However, the sons of Ahab were slaughtered by Jehu following his coup d'tat around 840 BCE.\\r\\nIn c. 732 BCE, Pekah of Israel, while allied with Rezin, king of Aram, threatened Jerusalem. Ahaz, king of Judah, appealed to Tiglath-Pileser III, the king of Assyria, for help. After Ahaz paid tribute to Tiglath-Pileser[18] Tiglath-Pileser sacked Damascus and Israel, annexing Aram[19] and territory of the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh in Gilead including the desert outposts of Jetur, Naphish and Nodab. People from these tribes including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the Khabur River system. Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of Naphtali and the city of Janoah in Ephraim and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of Naphtali. According to 2 Kings 16:9 and 15:29, the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.\\r\\nIsrael continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom until around 720 BCE, when it was again invaded by Assyria and the rest of the population deported. The Bible relates that the population of Israel was exiled, becoming known as the Ten Lost Tribes, leaving only the Tribe of Judah, the Tribe of Simeon (that was \\"absorbed\\" into Judah), the Tribe of Benjamin and the people of the Tribe of Levi who lived among them of the original Israelites nation in the southern Kingdom of Judah. However, in their book The Bible Unearthed, authors Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman estimate that only a fifth of the population (about 40,000) were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II.[1]:221 Many also fled south to Jerusalem, which appears to have expanded in size fivefold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water (Siloam) to be provided by King Hezekiah.\\r\\nThe remainder of the northern kingdom was conquered by Sargon II, who captured the capital city Samaria in the territory of Ephraim. He took 27,290 people captive from the city of Samaria resettling some with the Israelites in the Khabur region and the rest in the land of the Medes thus establishing Hebrew communities in Ecbatana and Rages.\\r\\nThe Book of Tobit additionally records that Sargon had taken other captives from the northern kingdom to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, in particular Tobit from the town of Thisbe in Naphtali.\\r\\nIn medieval Rabbinic fable, the concept of the ten tribes who were taken away from the House of David (who continued the rule of the southern kingdom of Judah), becomes confounded with accounts of the Assyrian deportations leading to the myth of the \\"Ten Lost Tribes\\". The recorded history differs from this fable: No record exists of the Assyrians having exiled people from Dan, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun or western Manasseh. Descriptions of the deportation of people from Reuben, Gad, Manasseh in Gilead, Ephraim and Naphtali indicate that only a portion of these tribes were deported and the places to which they were deported are known locations given in the accounts. The deported communities are mentioned as still existing at the time of the composition of the books of Kings and Chronicles and did not disappear by assimilation. 2 Chronicles 30:1-11[20] explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians in particular people of Ephraim, Manasseh, Asher, Issachar and Zebulun and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem during the reign of Hezekiah.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Judah continued to exist as an independent state until 586 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire.\\r\\nThe religious climate of the Kingdom of Israel appears to have followed two major trends. The first, that of worship of Yahweh, and the second that of worship of Baal as detailed in the Hebrew Bible (1 Kings 16:31) and in the Baal cycle discovered at Ugarit.\\r\\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible Jeroboam built two places of worship, one at Bethel and one at far northern Dan, as alternatives to the Temple in Jerusalem.[23](1 Kings 12:29) He did not want the people of his kingdom to have religious ties to Jerusalem, the capital city of the rival Kingdom of Judah. He erected golden bulls at the entrance to the Temples to represent the national god.[24] The Hebrew Bible, written from the perspective of scribes in Jerusalem, referred to these acts as the way of Jeroboam or the errors of Jeroboam.[24] (1 Kings 12:26-29)\\r\\nThe Bible states that Ahab allowed the cult worship of Baal to become an acceptable religion of the kingdom. His wife Jezebel was a devotee to Baal worship.

Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General Ambrose Burnside, as part of the American Civil War. The Union Army's futile frontal attacks on December 13 against entrenched Confederate defenders on the heights behind the city are remembered as one of the most one-sided battles of the war, with Union casualties more than three times as heavy as those suffered by the Confederates. A visitor to the battlefield described the battle to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln as a \\"butchery.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nBurnside's plan was to cross the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg in mid-November and race to the Confederate capital of Richmond before Lee's army could stop him. Bureaucratic delays prevented Burnside from receiving the necessary pontoon bridges in time and Lee moved his army to block the crossings. When the Union army was finally able to build its bridges and cross under fire, urban combat in the city resulted on December 11ÿ12. Union troops prepared to assault Confederate defensive positions south of the city and on a strongly fortified ridge just west of the city known as Marye's Heights.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 13, the \\"grand division\\" of Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin was able to pierce the first defensive line of Confederate Lieutenant General Stonewall Jackson to the south, but was finally repulsed. Burnside ordered the grand divisions of Maj. Gens. Edwin V. Sumner and Joseph Hooker to make multiple frontal assaults against Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's position on Marye's Heights, all of which were repulsed with heavy losses. On December 15, Burnside withdrew his army, ending another failed Union campaign in the Eastern Theater.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1862, Lincoln needed to demonstrate the success of the Union war effort before the Northern public lost confidence in his administration. Confederate armies had been on the move earlier in the fall, invading Kentucky and Maryland, and although each had been turned back, those armies remained intact and capable of further action. Lincoln urged Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to advance against the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg, Mississippi. He replaced Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell with Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, hoping for a more aggressive posture against the Confederates in Tennessee, and on November 5, seeing that his replacement of Buell had not stimulated Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan into action, he issued orders to replace McClellan in command of the Army of the Potomac in Virginia. McClellan had stopped Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Antietam in Maryland, but had not been able to destroy Lee's army, nor did he pursue Lee back into Virginia aggressively enough for Lincoln.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcClellan's replacement was Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, the commander of the IX Corps. Burnside had established a reputation as an independent commander, with successful operations earlier that year in coastal North Carolina and, unlike McClellan, had no apparent political ambitions. However, he felt himself unqualified for army-level command and objected when offered the position. He accepted only when it was made clear to him that McClellan would be replaced in any event and that an alternative choice for command was Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, whom Burnside disliked and distrusted. Burnside assumed command on November 7.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to prodding from Lincoln and general-in-chief Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, Burnside planned a late fall offensive; he communicated his plan to Halleck on November 9. The plan relied on quick movement and deception. He would concentrate his army in a visible fashion near Warrenton, feigning a movement on Culpeper Court House, Orange Court House, or Gordonsville. Then he would rapidly shift his army southeast and cross the Rappahannock River to Fredericksburg, hoping that Robert E. Lee would sit still, unclear as to Burnside's intentions, while the Union Army made a rapid movement against Richmond, south along the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad from Fredericksburg. Burnside selected this plan because he was concerned that if he were to move directly south from Warrenton, he would be exposed to a flanking attack from Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, whose corps was at that time in the Shenandoah Valley south of Winchester. He also believed that the Orange and Alexandria Railroad would be an inadequate supply line. (Burnside was also influenced by plans McClellan began developing just prior to being relieved. Aware that Lee had blocked the O&A, McClellan considered a route through Fredericksburg and ordered a small group of cavalrymen commanded by Capt. Ulric Dahlgren to investigate the condition of the RF&P.) While Burnside began assembling a supply base at Falmouth, near Fredericksburg, the Lincoln administration entertained a lengthy debate about the wisdom of his plan, which differed from the president's preference of a movement south on the O&A and a direct confrontation with Lee's army instead of the movement focused on the city of Richmond. Lincoln reluctantly approved the plan on November 14 but cautioned his general to move with great speed, certainly doubting that Lee would react as Burnside anticipated.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Army began marching on November 15, and the first elements arrived in Falmouth on November 17. Burnside's plan quickly went awryhe had ordered pontoon bridges to be sent to the front and assembled for his quick crossing of the Rappahannock, but because of administrative bungling, the bridges did not arrive on time. Burnside first requisitioned the pontoon bridging (along with many other provisions) on November 7 when he detailed his plan to Halleck. The plan was sent to the attention of Brig. Gen. George Washington Cullum, the chief of staff in Washington (received on November 9). Plans called for both riverine and overland movement of the pontoon trains to Falmouth. On November 14, the 50th New York Engineers reported the pontoons were ready to move, except for a lack of the 270 horses needed to move them. Unknown to Burnside, most of the bridging was still on the upper Potomac. Communications between Burnside's staff engineer Cyrus B. Comstock and the Engineer Brigade commander Daniel P. Woodbury indicate that Burnside had assumed the bridging was en route to Washington based on orders given on November 6.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner arrived, he strongly urged an immediate crossing of the river to scatter the token Confederate force of 500 men in the town and occupying the commanding heights to the west. Burnside became anxious, concerned that the increasing autumn rains would make the fording points unusable and that Sumner might be cut off and destroyed, ordering Sumner to wait in Falmouth.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nLee at first anticipated that Burnside would beat him across the Rappahannock and that to protect Richmond, he would assume the next defensible position to the south, the North Anna River. But when he saw how slowly Burnside was moving (and Confederate President Jefferson Davis expressed reservations about planning for a battle so close to Richmond), he directed all of his army toward Fredericksburg. By November 23, all of Longstreet's corps had arrived and Lee placed them on the ridge known as Marye's Heights to the west of town, with Anderson's division on the far left, McLaws's directly behind the town, and Pickett's and Hood's to the right. He sent for Jackson on November 26, but his Second Corps commander had anticipated the need and began forced-marching his troops from Winchester on November 22, covering as many as 20 miles a day. Jackson arrived at Lee's headquarters on November 29 and his divisions were deployed to prevent Burnside crossing downstream from Fredericksburg: D.H. Hill's division moved to Port Royal, 18 miles down river; Early's 12 miles down river at Skinker's Neck; A.P. Hill's at Thomas Yerby's house, \\"Belvoir\\", about 6 miles southeast of town; and Taliaferro's along the RF&P Railroad, 4 miles south at Guinea Station.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boats and equipment for a single pontoon bridge arrived at Falmouth on November 25, much too late to enable the Army of the Potomac to cross the river without opposition. Burnside still had an opportunity, however, because by then he was facing only half of Lee's army, not yet dug in, and if he acted quickly, he might have been able to attack Longstreet and defeat him before Jackson arrived. Once again he squandered his opportunity. The full complement of bridges arrived at the end of the month, but by this time Jackson was present and Longstreet was preparing strong defenses.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBurnside originally planned to cross his army east of Fredericksburg at Skinker's Neck, but an advance movement by Federal gunboats to there was fired upon and drew Early's and D.H. Hill's divisions into that area, a movement spotted by Union balloon observers. Now assuming that Lee had anticipated his plan, Burnside guessed that the Confederates had weakened their left and center to concentrate against him on their right. So he decided to cross directly at Fredericksburg. On December 9, he wrote to Halleck, \\"I think now the enemy will be more surprised by a crossing immediately in our front than any other part of the river. ... I'm convinced that a large force of the enemy is now concentrated at Port Royal, its left resting on Fredericksburg, which we hope to turn.\\" In addition to his numerical advantage in troop strength, Burnside also had the advantage of knowing his army could not be attacked effectively. On the other side of the Rappahannock, 220 artillery pieces had been located on the ridge known as Stafford Heights to prevent Lee's army from mounting any major counterattacks.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nBurnside organized his Army of the Potomac into three so-called Grand Divisions, organizations that included infantry corps, cavalry, and artillery, comprising 120,000 men, of whom 114,000 would be engaged in the coming battle:[5][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia had nearly 79,000 men,[8] with 72,500[9] engaged. His organization of the army in corps was approved by an act of the Confederate Congress on November 6, 1862 and consisted of:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two armies at Fredericksburg represented the largest number of armed men that ever confronted each other for combat during the Civil War.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion Army pontoon boats mobilized for deployment\\r\\n\\r\\nModel of a portion of the pontoon bridge built for the film Gods and Generals, displayed at the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park\\r\\n\\r\\nPontoon bridges at Franklin's Crossing\\r\\n\\r\\nBarksdale's Mississippi brigade fires at the Union engineers\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion engineers began to assemble six pontoon bridges before dawn on December 11, two just north of the town center, a third on the southern end of town, and three farther south, near the confluence of the Rappahannock and Deep Run. The engineers constructing the bridge directly across from the city came under punishing fire from Confederate sharpshooters, primarily from the Mississippi brigade of Brig. Gen. William Barksdale, in command of the town defenses. Union artillery attempted to dislodge the sharpshooters, but their positions in the cellars of houses rendered the fire from 150 guns mostly ineffective. Eventually Burnside's artillery commander, Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt, convinced him to send infantry landing parties over in the pontoon boats to secure a small bridgehead and rout the sharpshooters. Col. Norman J. Hall volunteered his brigade for this assignment. Burnside suddenly turned reluctant, lamenting to Hall in front of his men that \\"the effort meant death to most of those who should undertake the voyage.\\" When his men responded to Hall's request with three cheers, Burnside relented. At 3 p.m., the Union artillery began a preparatory bombardment and 135 infantrymen from the 7th Michigan and the 19th Massachusetts crowded into the small boats, and the 20th Massachusetts followed soon after. They crossed successfully and spread out in a skirmish line to clear the sharpshooters. Although some of the Confederates surrendered, fighting proceeded street by street through the town as the engineers completed the bridges. Sumner's Right Grand Division began crossing at 4:30?p.m., but the bulk of his men did not cross until December 12. Hooker's Center Grand Division crossed on December 13, using both the northern and southern bridges.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clearing of the city buildings by Sumner's infantry and by artillery fire from across the river began the first major urban combat of the war. Union gunners sent more than 5,000 shells against the town and the ridges to the west. By nightfall, four brigades of Union troops occupied the town, which they looted with a fury that had not been seen in the war up to that point. This behavior enraged Lee, who compared their depredations with those of the ancient Vandals. The destruction also angered the Confederate troops, many of whom were native Virginians. Many on the Union side were also shocked by the destruction inflicted on Fredericksburg. Civilian casualties were unusually sparse in the midst of such widespread violence; George Rable estimates no more than four civilian deaths.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiver crossings south of the city by Franklin's Left Grand Division were much less eventful. Both bridges were completed by 11 a.m. on December 11 while five batteries of Union artillery suppressed most sniper fire against the engineers. Franklin was ordered at 4 p.m. to cross his entire command, but only a single brigade was sent out before dark. Crossings resumed at dawn and were completed by 1 p.m. on December 12. Early on December 13, Jackson recalled his divisions under Jubal Early and D.H. Hill from down river positions to join his main defensive lines south of the city.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nBurnside's verbal instructions on December 12 outlined a main attack by Franklin, supported by Hooker, on the southern flank, while Sumner made a secondary attack on the northern. His actual orders on December 13 were vague and confusing to his subordinates. At 5 p.m. on December 12, he made a cursory inspection of the southern flank, where Franklin and his subordinates pressed him to give definite orders for a morning attack by the grand division, so they would have adequate time to position their forces overnight. However, Burnside demurred and the order did not reach Franklin until 7:15 or 7:45?a.m. When it arrived, it was not as Franklin expected. Rather than ordering an attack by the entire grand division of almost 60,000 men, Franklin was to keep his men in position, but was to send \\"a division at least\\" to seize the high ground (Prospect Hill) around Hamilton's Crossing, Sumner was to send one division through the city and up Telegraph Road, and both flanks were to be prepared to commit their entire commands. Burnside was apparently expecting these weak attacks to intimidate Lee, causing him to withdraw. Franklin, who had originally advocated a vigorous assault, chose to interpret Burnside's order very conservatively. Brig. Gen. James A. Hardie, who delivered the order, did not ensure that Burnside's intentions were understood by Franklin, and map inaccuracies about the road network made those intentions unclear. Furthermore, Burnside's choice of the verb \\"to seize\\" was less forceful in 19th century military terminology than an order \\"to carry\\" the heights.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember 13 began cold and overcast. A dense fog blanketed the ground and made it impossible for the armies to see each other. Franklin ordered his I Corps commander, Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds, to select a division for the attack. Reynolds chose his smallest division, about 4,500 men commanded by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, and assigned Brig. Gen. John Gibbon's division to support Meade's attack. His reserve division, under Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday, was to face south and protect the left flank between the Richmond Road and the river. Meade's division began moving out at 8:30?a.m., with Gibbon following behind. At around 10:30, the fog started lifting. They moved parallel to the river initially, turning right to face the Richmond Road, where they began to be struck by enfilading fire from the Virginia Horse Artillery under Major John Pelham. Pelham started with two cannonsa 12-pounder Napoleon smoothbore and a rifled Blakelybut continued with only one after the latter was disabled by counter-battery fire. \\"Jeb\\" Stuart sent word to Pelham that he should feel free to withdraw from his dangerous position at any time, to which Pelham responded, \\"Tell the General I can hold my ground.\\" The Iron Brigade (formerly Gibbon's command, but now led by Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith) was sent out to deal with the Confederate horse artillery. This action was mainly conducted by the 24th Michigan Infantry, a newly enlisted regiment that had joined the brigade in October. After about an hour, Pelham's ammunition began to run low and he withdrew. General Lee observed the action and commented about Pelham, age 24, \\"It is glorious to see such courage in one so young.\\" The most prominent victim of Pelham's fire was Brig. Gen. George D. Bayard, a cavalry general mortally wounded by a shell while standing in reserve near Franklin's headquarters. Jackson's main artillery batteries had remained silent in the fog during this exchange, but the Union troops soon began to receive direct fire from Prospect Hill, principally five batteries directed by Lt. Col. Reuben Lindsay Walker, and Meade's attack was stalled about 600 yards from his initial objective for almost two hours by these combined artillery attacks.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union artillery fire was lifted as Meade's men moved forward around 1 p.m. Jackson's force of about 35,000 remained concealed on the wooded ridge to Meade's front. His formidable defensive line had an unforeseen flaw. In A.P. Hill's division's line, a triangular patch of the woods that extended beyond the railroad was swampy and covered with thick underbrush and the Confederates had left a 600-yard gap there between the brigades of Brig. Gens. James H. Lane and James J. Archer. Brig. Gen. Maxcy Gregg's brigade stood about a quarter mile behind the gap. Meade's 1st Brigade (Col. William Sinclair) entered the gap, climbed the railroad embankment, and turned right into the underbrush, striking Lane's brigade in the flank. Following immediately behind, his 3rd Brigade (Brig. Gen. Feger Jackson) turned left and hit Archer's flank. The 2nd Brigade (Col. Albert L. Magilton) came up in support and intermixed with the leading brigades. As the gap widened with pressure on the flanks, thousands of Meade's men reached the top of the ridge and ran into Gregg's brigade. Many of these Confederates had stacked arms while taking cover from Union artillery and were not expecting to be attacked at that moment, so were killed or captured unarmed. Gregg at first mistook the Union soldiers for fleeing Confederate troops and ordered his men not to fire on them. While he rode prominently in front of his lines, the partially deaf Gregg could not hear the approaching Federals or their bullets flying around him. In the confusion, a bullet struck his spine and fatally wounded him; he died two days later. Col. Daniel Hamilton of the 1st South Carolina assumed command, but Gregg's brigade was totally routed and was no longer an organized unit for the rest of the day. James Archer meanwhile was being pressed hard on his left flank and sent word for Gregg to reinforce him, unaware that he had been shot and his brigade had disintegrated. The 19th Georgia's flag was captured by the adjutant of the 7th Pennsylvania Reserves; it was the only Confederate regimental flag captured and retained by the Army of the Potomac in the battle.[30] The Georgians broke and ran. The 14th Tennessee resisted the onslaught for a time before also breaking; a sizable number of its men were taken prisoner. Archer frantically sent messages to the rear, calling on John Brockenbrough and Edmund Atkinson's brigades for help. With ammunition on both sides running low, hand-to-hand fighting ensued with soldiers stabbing at each other with bayonets and using muskets as clubs. Most of the regimental officers on both sides went down as well; on the Confederate side, the 1st Tennessee went through three commanders in a matter of minutes. Meade's 15 regiments also lost most of their officers, although Meade himself survived the battle unscathed despite being exposed to heavy artillery fire.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nConfederate reservesthe divisions of Brig. Gens. Jubal A. Early and William B. Taliaferromoved into the fray from behind Gregg's original position. Inspired by their attack, regiments from Lane's and Archer's brigades rallied and formed a new defensive line in the gap. Now Meade's men were receiving fire from three sides and could not withstand the pressure. Feger Jackson attempted to flank a Confederate battery, but after his horse was shot and he began to lead on foot, he was shot in the head by a volley and his brigade fell back, leaderless (Col. Joseph W. Fisher soon replaced Jackson in command).[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOverview of the battle, December 13, 1862 (additional map 1).\\r\\n\\r\\nOverview of the battle, December 13, 1862 (additional map 2).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Meade's right, Gibbon's division prepared to move forward at 1 p.m. Brig. Gen. Nelson Taylor proposed to Gibbon that they supplement Meade's assault with a bayonet charge against Lane's position. However, Gibbon stated that this would violate his orders, so Taylor's brigade did not move forward until 1:30?p.m. The attack did not have the benefit of a gap to exploit, nor did the Union soldiers have any wooded cover for their advance, so progress was slow under heavy fire from Lane's brigade and Confederate artillery. Immediately following Taylor was the brigade of Col. Peter Lyle, and the advance of the two brigades ground to a halt before they reached the railroad. Committing his reserve at 1:45?p.m., Gibbon sent forward his brigade under Col. Adrian R. Root, which moved through the survivors of the first two brigades, but they were soon brought to a halt as well. Eventually some of the Federals reached the crest of the ridge and had some success during hand-to-hand fightingmen on both sides had depleted their ammunition and resorted to bayonets and rifle butts, and even empty rifles with bayonets thrown like javelinsbut they were forced to withdraw back across the railroad embankment along with Meade's men to their left. Gibbon's attack, despite heavy casualties, had failed to support Meade's temporary breakthrough and Gibbon himself was wounded when a shell fragment struck his right hand. Brig. Gen Nelson Taylor took over command of the division.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaj. Gen. George G. Meade to Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds, afternoon of December 13[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nGen. Robert E. Lee, watching the carnage of the Confederate counterattack from the center of his line, a position now known as Lee's Hill[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the battle Meade complained that some of Gibbon's officers had not charged quickly enough. But his primary frustration was with Brig. Gen. David B. Birney, whose division of the III Corps had been designated to support the attack as well. Birney claimed that his men had been subjected to damaging artillery fire as they formed up, that he had not understood the importance of Meade's attack, and that Reynolds had not ordered his division forward. When Meade galloped to the rear to confront Birney with a string of fierce profanities that, in the words of one staff lieutenant, \\"almost makes the stones creep,\\" he was finally able to order the brigadier forward under his own responsibility, but harbored resentment for weeks. By this time, however, it was too late to accomplish any further offensive action.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly's division began a counterattack, led initially by Col. Edmund N. Atkinson's Georgia brigade, which inspired the men from the brigades of Col. Robert Hoke, Brig. Gen. James J. Archer, and Col. John M. Brockenbrough to charge forward out of the railroad ditches, driving Meade's men from the woods in a disorderly retreat, followed closely by Gibbon's. Early's orders to his brigades were to pursue as far as the railroad, but in the chaos many kept up the pressure over the open fields as far as the old Richmond Road. Union artillery crews proceeded to unleash a blast of close-range canister shot, firing as fast as they could load their guns. The Confederates were also struck by the leading brigade of Birney's belated advance, commanded by Brig. Gen. J. H. Hobart Ward. Birney followed up with the brigades of Brig. Gens. Hiram G. Berry and John C. Robinson, which broke the Rebel advance that had threatened to drive the Union into the river. Col. Atkinson was struck in the shoulder by canister shot and abandoned by his own brigade; Union soldiers later found and took him prisoner. Any further Confederate advance was deterred by the arrival of the III Corps division of Brig. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles on the right. General Burnside, who by this time was focused on his attacks on Marye's Heights, was dismayed that his left flank attack had not achieved the success he assumed earlier in the day. He ordered Franklin to \\"advance his right and front,\\" but despite repeated entreaties, Franklin refused, claiming that all of his forces had been engaged. This was not true, however, as the entire VI Corps and Brig. Gen. Abner Doubleday's division of the I Corps had been mostly idle, suffering only a few casualties from artillery fire while they waited in reserve.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Confederates withdrew back to the safety of the hills south of town. Stonewall Jackson considered mounting a resumed counterattack, but the Federal artillery and impending darkness changed his mind. A fortuitous Union breakthrough had been wasted because Franklin did not reinforce Meade's success with some of the 20,000 men standing in reserve. Neither Franklin nor Reynolds took any personal involvement in the battle, and were unavailable to their subordinates at the critical point. Franklin's losses were about 5,000 casualties in comparison to Stonewall Jackson's 3,400, demonstrating the ferocity of the fighting. Skirmishing and artillery duels continued until dark, but no additional major attacks took place, while the center of the battle moved north to Marye's Heights. Brig. Gen George D. Bayard, who commanded a cavalry brigade in the VI Corps, was struck in the leg by a shell fragment and died two days later.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the fighting south of Fredericksburg died down, the air was filled with the screams of hundreds of wounded men and horses. Dry sage grass around them caught fire and burned many men alive.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the northern end of the battlefield, Brig. Gen. William H. French's division of the II Corps prepared to move forward, subjected to Confederate artillery fire that was descending on the fog-covered city of Fredericksburg. General Burnside's orders to Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner, commander of the Right Grand Division, was to send \\"a division or more\\" to seize the high ground to the west of the city, assuming that his assault on the southern end of the Confederate line would be the decisive action of the battle. The avenue of approach was difficultmostly open fields, but interrupted by scattered houses, fences, and gardens that would restrict the movement of battle lines. A canal stood about 200 yards west of the town, crossed by three narrow bridges, which would require the Union troops to funnel themselves into columns before proceeding. About 600 yards to the west of Fredericksburg was the low ridge known as Marye's Heights, rising 40ÿ50 feet above the plain. (Although popularly known as Marye's Heights, the ridge was composed of several hills separated by ravines, from north to south: Taylor's Hill, Stansbury Hill, Marye's Hill, and Willis Hill.) Near the crest of the portion of the ridge comprising Marye's Hill and Willis Hill, a narrow lane in a slight cutthe Telegraph Road, known after the battle as the Sunken Roadwas protected by a 4-foot stone wall, enhanced in places with log breastworks and abatis, making it a perfect infantry defensive position. Confederate Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws initially had about 2,000 men on the front line of Marye's Heights and there were an additional 7,000 men in reserve on the crest and behind the ridge. Massed artillery provided almost uninterrupted coverage of the plain below. General Longstreet had been assured by his artillery commander, Lt. Col. Edward Porter Alexander, \\"General, we cover that ground now so well that we will comb it as with a fine-tooth comb. A chicken could not live on that field when we open on it.\\"[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fog lifted from the town around 10 a.m. and Sumner gave his order to advance an hour later. French's brigade under Brig. Gen. Nathan Kimball began to move around noon. They advanced slowly through heavy artillery fire, crossed the canal in columns over the narrow bridges, and formed in line, with fixed bayonets, behind the protection of a shallow bluff. In perfect line of battle, they advanced up the muddy slope until they were cut down at about 125 yards from the stone wall by repeated rifle volleys. Some soldiers were able to get as close as 40 yards, but having suffered severe casualties from both the artillery and infantry fire, the survivors clung to the ground. Kimball was severely wounded during the assault, and his brigade suffered 25% casualties. French's brigades under Col. John W. Andrews and Col. Oliver H. Palmer followed, with casualty rates of almost 50%.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nSumner's original order called for the division of Brig. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock to support French and Hancock sent forward his brigade under Col. Samuel K. Zook behind Palmer's. They met a similar fate. Next was his Irish Brigade under Brig. Gen. Thomas F. Meagher. By coincidence, they attacked the area defended by fellow Irishmen of Col. Robert McMillan's 24th Georgia Infantry. One Confederate who spotted the green regimental flags approaching cried out, \\"Oh God, what a pity! Here comes Meagher's fellows.\\" But McMillan exhorted his troops: \\"Give it to them now, boys! Now's the time! Give it to them!\\" Hancock's final brigade was led by Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell. Leading his two regiments on the left, Col. Nelson A. Miles suggested to Caldwell that the practice of marching in formation, firing, and stopping to reload, made the Union soldiers easy targets, and that a concerted bayonet charge might be effective in carrying the works. Caldwell denied permission. Miles was struck by a bullet in the throat as he led his men to within 40 yards of the wall, where they were pinned down as their predecessors had been. Caldwell himself was soon struck by two bullets and put out of action.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commander of the II Corps, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch, was dismayed at the carnage wrought upon his two divisions in the hour of fighting and, like Col. Miles, realized that the tactics were not working. He first considered a massive bayonet charge to overwhelm the defenders, but as he surveyed the front, he quickly realized that French's and Hancock's divisions were in no shape to move forward again. He next planned for his final division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, to swing to the right and attempt to envelop the Confederate left, but upon receiving urgent requests for help from French and Hancock, he sent Howard's men over and around the fallen troops instead. The brigade of Col. Joshua Owen went in first, reinforced by Col. Norman J. Hall's brigade, and then two regiments of Brig. Gen. Alfred Sully's brigade. The other corps in Sumner's grand division was the IX Corps, and he sent in one of its divisions under Brig. Gen. Samuel Sturgis. After two hours of desperate fighting, four Union divisions had failed in the mission Burnside had originally assigned to one. Casualties were heavy: II Corps losses for the afternoon were 4,114, Sturgis's division 1,011.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Union Army paused, Longstreet reinforced his line so that there were four ranks of infantrymen behind the stone wall. Brig. Gen. Thomas R. R. Cobb of Georgia, who had commanded the key sector of the line, was mortally wounded by an exploding artillery shell and was replaced by Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw. General Lee expressed concerns to Longstreet about the massing troops breaking his line, but Longstreet assured his commander, \\"General, if you put every man on the other side of the Potomac on that field to approach me over the same line, and give me plenty of ammunition, I will kill them all before they reach my line.\\"[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy midafternoon, Burnside had failed on both flanks to make progress against the Confederates. Rather than reconsidering his approach in the face of heavy casualties, he stubbornly decided to continue on the same path. He sent orders to Franklin to renew the assault on the left (which, as described earlier, the Left Grand Division commander ignored) and ordered his Center Grand Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, to cross the Rappahannock into Fredericksburg and continue the attack on Marye's Heights. Hooker performed a personal reconnaissance (something that neither Burnside nor Sumner had done, both remaining east of the river during the failed assaults) and returned to Burnside's headquarters to advise against the attack.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrig. Gen. Daniel Butterfield, commanding Hooker's V Corps, while waiting for Hooker to return from his conference with Burnside, sent his division under Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin to relieve Sturgis's men. By this time, Maj. Gen. George Pickett's Confederate division and one of Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's brigades had marched north to reinforce Marye's Heights. Griffin smashed his three brigades against the Confederate position, one by one. Also concerned about Sturgis, Couch sent the six guns of Capt. John G. Hazard's Battery B, 1st Rhode Island Light Artillery, to within 150 yards of the Confederate line. They were hit hard by Confederate sharpshooter and artillery fire and provided no effective relief to Sturgis.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nA soldier in Hancock's division reported movement in the Confederate line that led some to believe that the enemy might be retreating. Despite the unlikeliness of this supposition, the V Corps division of Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys was ordered to attack and capitalize on the situation. Humphreys led his first brigade on horseback, with his men moving over and around fallen troops with fixed bayonets and unloaded rifles; some of the fallen men clutched at the passing pant legs, urging their comrades not to go forward, causing the brigade to become disorganized in their advance. The charge reached to within 50 yards before being cut down by concentrated rifle fire. Brig. Gen. George Sykes was ordered to move forward with his V Corps regular army division to support Humphreys's retreat, but his men were caught in a crossfire and pinned down.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 4 p.m., Hooker had returned from his meeting with Burnside, having failed to convince the commanding general to abandon the attacks. While Humphreys was still attacking, Hooker reluctantly ordered the IX Corps division of Brig. Gen. George W. Getty to attack as well, but this time to the leftmost portion of Marye's Heights, Willis Hill. Col. Rush Hawkins's brigade, followed by Col. Edward Harland's brigade, moved along an unfinished railroad line just north of Hazel Run, approaching close to the Confederate line without detection in the gathering twilight, but they were eventually detected, fired on, and repulsed.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven Union divisions had been sent in, generally one brigade at a time, for a total of fourteen individual charges,[49] all of which failed, costing them from 6,000 to 8,000 casualties.[50] Confederate losses at Marye's Heights totaled around 1,200.[51] The falling of darkness and the pleas of Burnside's subordinates were enough to put an end to the attacks. Longstreet later wrote, \\"The charges had been desperate and bloody, but utterly hopeless.\\"[52] Thousands of Union soldiers spent the cold December night on the fields leading to the heights, unable to move or assist the wounded because of Confederate fire. That night, Burnside attempted to blame his subordinates for the disastrous attacks, but they argued that it was entirely his fault and no one else's.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a dinner meeting the evening of December 13, Burnside dramatically announced that he would personally lead his old IX Corps in one final attack on Marye's Heights, but his generals talked him out of it the following morning. The armies remained in position throughout the day on December 14. That afternoon, Burnside asked Lee for a truce to attend to his wounded, which the latter graciously granted. The next day the Federal forces retreated across the river, and the campaign came to an end.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nTestament to the extent of the carnage and suffering during the battle was the story of Richard Rowland Kirkland, a Confederate Army sergeant with Company G, 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry. Stationed at the stone wall by the sunken road below Marye's Heights, Kirkland had a close up view to the suffering and like so many others was appalled at the cries for help of the Union wounded throughout the cold winter night of December 13, 1862. After obtaining permission from his commander, Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw, Kirkland gathered canteens and in broad daylight, without the benefit of a cease fire or a flag of truce (refused by Kershaw), provided water to numerous Union wounded lying on the field of battle. Union soldiers held their fire as it was obvious what Kirkland's intent was. Kirkland was nicknamed the \\"Angel of Marye's Heights\\" for these actions, and is memorialized with a statue by Felix de Weldon on the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park where he carried out his actions.[56] Details of this story (first recorded in 1880) conflict with multiple after-action reports and may have been embellished and personalized for effect.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the night of December 14, the Aurora Borealis made an appearance unusual for that latitude, presumably caused by a large solar flare. One witness described that \\"the wonderful spectacle of the Aurora Borealis was seen in the Gulf States. The whole sky was a ruddy glow as if from an enormous conflagration, but marked by the darting rays peculiar to the Northern light.\\" The event was noted in the diaries and letters of many soldiers at Fredericksburg, such as John W. Thompson, Jr., who wrote \\"Louisiana sent those famous cosmopolitan Zouaves called the Louisiana Tigers, and there were Florida troops who, undismayed in fire, stampeded the night after Fredericksburg, when the Aurora Borealis snapped and crackled over that field of the frozen dead hard by the Rappahannock ...\\"[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nWestern view from Fredericksburg down Telegraph Road with Marye's Heights visible in the distant center\\r\\n\\r\\nMarye's House upon Marye's Heights was the center of the Confederate position during the battle.

Burnside observed the battle primarily from this location.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union army suffered 12,653 casualties (1,284 killed, 9,600 wounded, 1,769 captured/missing).[11][59] Two Union generals were mortally wounded: Brig. Gens. George D. Bayard and Conrad F. Jackson. The Confederate army lost 5,377 (608 killed, 4,116 wounded, 653 captured/missing),[13][60] most of them in the early fighting on Jackson's front. Confederate Brig. Gens. Maxcy Gregg and T. R. R. Cobb were both mortally wounded. The casualties sustained by each army showed clearly how disastrous the Union army's tactics were. Although the fighting on the southern flank produced roughly equal casualties (about 4,000 Confederate, 5,000 Union), the northern flank was completely lopsided, with about eight Union casualties for each Confederate. Burnside's men had suffered considerably more in the attack originally meant as a diversion than in his main effort.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South erupted in jubilation over their great victory. The Richmond Examiner described it as a \\"stunning defeat to the invader, a splendid victory to the defender of the sacred soil.\\" General Lee, normally reserved, was described by the Charleston Mercury as \\"jubilant, almost off-balance, and seemingly desirous of embracing everyone who calls on him.\\" The newspaper also exclaimed that, \\"General Lee knows his business and the army has yet known no such word as fail.\\"[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nReactions were opposite in the North, and both the Army and President Lincoln came under strong attacks from politicians and the press. The Cincinnati Commercial wrote, \\"It can hardly be in human nature for men to show more valor or generals to manifest less judgment, than were perceptible on our side that day.\\" Senator Zachariah Chandler, a Radical Republican, wrote that, \\"The President is a weak man, too weak for the occasion, and those fool or traitor generals are wasting time and yet more precious blood in indecisive battles and delays.\\" Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin visited the White House after a trip to the battlefield. He told the president, \\"It was not a battle, it was a butchery.\\" Curtin reported that the president was \\"heart-broken at the recital, and soon reached a state of nervous excitement bordering on insanity.\\" Lincoln himself wrote, \\"If there is a worse place than hell, I am in it.\\"[14] Burnside was relieved of command a month later, following an unsuccessful attempt to purge some of his subordinates from the Army and the humiliating failure of his \\"Mud March\\" in January.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, was established in 1927 under the War Department and transferred to the National Park Service in 1933. It consists of more than 8,300 acres that cover parts of four Civil War battlefields?ÿ Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania Court House, The Wilderness and Chancellorsville.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2003, the Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) announced the beginning of a $12 million national campaign to preserve the historic Slaughter Pen Farm, a key part of the Fredericksburg battlefield. The 208-acre (0.84?km2) farm, known locally as the Pierson Tract, was the scene of bloody struggle on December 13, 1862. Over this ground Federal troops under Maj. Gen. George Meade and Brig. Gen. John Gibbon launched their assault against Lt. Gen. Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's Confederates holding the southern portion of the Army of Northern Virginia's line at Fredericksburg. Despite suffering enormous casualties the Federal troops under Meade were able to temporarily penetrate the Confederate line and for a time represented the North's best chance of winning the Battle of Fredericksburg. The fighting on this southern portion of the battlefield, later named the Slaughter Pen, produced 5,000 casualties and five Medal of Honor recipients.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Slaughter Pen Farm was considered to be the largest remaining unprotected part of the Fredericksburg battlefield. It is also the only place on the battlefield where a visitor can still follow the Union assault of December 13 from beginning to end. Nearly all the other land associated with Union attacks at Fredericksburgeither on the southern end of the battlefield or in front of Marye's Heightshas been degraded by development. The $12 million acquisition of the Slaughter Pen Farm at the Fredericksburg battlefield has been called the most ambitious nonprofit battlefield acquisition in American history.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2006, the Department of the Interior awarded a $2 million grant based on the significance of the Slaughter Pen Farm. The money was provided through a U.S. Congressional appropriation from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The fund supports non-federal efforts to acquire and preserve meaningful American Civil War battlefield lands. The program is administered by the American Battlefield Protection Program, an arm of the National Park Service. In addition, the Central Virginia Battlefields Trust (CVBT) committed $1 million toward the Slaughter Pen Farm fundraising campaign.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the preservation of the Slaughter Pen Farm, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved an additional 40 acres (0.16?km2) of the battlefield in five other acquisitions.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2012, during archaeological investigations at the construction site for a new courthouse, remains of Union artifacts were recovered. These included ammunition, smoking pipes, and food tins.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of Fredericksburg was depicted in the 2003 film Gods and Generals, based on the novel of the same name, a prequel of The Killer Angels from which the earlier film Gettysburg was adapted. Both the novel and film focused primarily on the disastrous charges on Marye's Heights, with the movie highlighting the charges of Hancock's division of II Corps, the Irish Brigade, Caldwell's brigade, and Zook's brigade, and the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment (V Corps).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican author Louisa May Alcott fictionalized her experience nursing soldiers injured in the Battle of Fredericksburg in her book Hospital Sketches (1863).[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican heavy metal band Iced Earth wrote a song inspired by the battle, titled \\"Clear The Way (December 13th, 1862)\\", and included it in their 2017 album Incorruptible.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle of Fredericksburg and what led up to it, and the nearly disastrous aftermath of the battle on Lincolns administration, which faced U.S. Senate efforts to usurp Lincolns role as commander in chief, is the subject of the novel \\"The Wastage,\\" by Dean Halliday Smith.","input":"What state was the battle of fredericksburg fought in?"},{"output":"September 6, 1787","context":"","input":"When did the electoral college come into existence?"},{"output":"Mahiyangana, Uva Province","context":"Stupas, also called dagobas and cetiyas, are considered an outstanding type of architectural creation of ancient Sri Lanka. Under the influence of Buddhism, there were several changes in the field of architecture in Sri Lanka. The stupa commands a prominent place among these changes. The Stupa is also known by synonymous names such as Chaithya, Dagaba, Thupa, Seya and Vehera.[1] Stupas designed and constructed in Sri Lanka are the largest brick structures known to the pre-modern world.[2]\\r\\nAfter Mahinda introduced Buddhism during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura (307-267 BCE), in the Sri Lankas ancient sacred capital of Anuradhapura, the king built the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya, a mahavihara, after dedicating the Nandana and Mahamega royal pleasure gardens to the Maha Sangha. The earliest monument found in Sri Lanka is the Stupa, which is described as a hemispherical dome surmounted with a spire (kota).\\r\\nMahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara in Mahiyangana, Uva Province is regarded as the first stupa of ancient Sri Lanka[3]The first historical stupa constructed after the arrival of Mahinda in Sri Lanka is Thuparamaya, which was built during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa.[4] Afterwards many stupas were built, some colossal stupas, biggest of which is Jetavanaramaya.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two recorded instances regarding the construction of stupas in Sri Lanka in the lifetime of Gautama Buddha. One of those instances is the construction of the cetiya at Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara at Mahiyangana in the valley of Mahaweli, which enshrines the Buddha's Hair Relic reputedly presented by the Buddha to Saman, a deva.The other instance is the construction of a stupa at Tiriyaya enshrining the Hair Relics presented to the tradesman brothers Tapassu and Balluka. This event is mentioned in an inscription written in Sanskrit found at this site.[1]\\r\\nDuring the time of Ashoka, numerous stupas were built at hallowed sites in India. In these were enshrined relics of the Buddha which people venerated. When it was observed that there were no Buddha relics in Sri Lanka, the king, at Mahindas suggestion, appealed to Emperor Asoka to send some relics. He responded to the kings request and sent the right collarbone relic of the Buddha. King Devanam Piya Tissa built the Thuparamaya to enshrine this relic, the right collarbone of the Buddha. The Thuparamaya is regarded as the first ever historical stupa built in Sri Lanka. The building of colossal stupas started during the reign of King Dutugamunu. Afterward many kings built stupas.[1]\\r\\nThe construction of stupas were considered acts of great merit. The purpose of stupas were mainly to enshrine relics of Buddha. The design specifications are consistent within most of the stupas, entrances to stupas are laid out so that their centre lines point to the relic chambers.[6]\\r\\nThe stupas were covered with a coating of lime plaster, plaster combinations changed with the requirements of the design, items used included lime, clay, sand, pebbles, crushed seashells, sugar syrup, white of egg, coconut water, plant resin, drying oil, glues and saliva of white ants.[6] The fine plaster at Kiri Vehera used small pebbles, crushed seashells mixed with lime and sand were used in the stupas from the fifth to twelfth centuries.\\r\\nA stupa usually has six parts:[5]\\r\\nA stupa consists of three such berms at its base. The three berms rising from the base gradually reduce in size.\\r\\nThe hemispherical dome is constructed on the three berms. In the middle of the dagaba was built a relic chamber (Dhathu garbhaya). The Buddha's relics are enshrined there. In the centre of the Relic Chamber was placed a bo-tree made of precious metals, and an image of the Buddha round which were groups of figures representing various events in the life of the Buddha.\\r\\nRelics are enshrined in this part too.\\r\\nThis is built on the Hatharas Kotuwa. Figures of deities are carved on the surface.\\r\\nThis is built on the Devatha Kotuwa. A crystal (chudamanikya) on a pinnacle made of metal is placed at the top of the spire to adorn it.\\r\\nThere are other constructions associated with the stupa:\\r\\nThis is a structure constructed joining the stupa at its four cardinal directions as a decorative flourish. Later these frontispieces came to be decorated or embellished with designs such as the creeper design. Stone slabs erected for the purpose of offering flower at the stupa too have been added to these frontispieces.\\r\\nThe chetiyagara is a structure constructed as a protection chamber for the stupa. There is evidence to show that such chambers were erected to shelter the small stupas built during the early years. The roofs of these structures are believed to have been wooden.[1]\\r\\nBasically, a stupa has several salient features. Buddhist literature mentions six types of stupas differing according to the shape of the dome or body of a dagaba.[1] This is mentioned in \\"Vijayantha Potha\\".[5]\\r\\nThey are:\\r\\ne.g.?: Kelaniya stupa\\r\\ne.g.?: Ambastala dagaba at Mihintale\\r\\ne.g.?: Ruwanweli Maha Seya at Anuradhapura, Rankoth Vehera & Kiri Vehera at Pollonnaruwa\\r\\ne.g.?: Situlpavwa, Somawathiya, Kiri Vehera at Kataragama\\r\\ne.g.?: Vijayarama at Anuradhapura, Puliyankulama, Indikatu Seya at Mihintale\\r\\nNo records exist of the finding of this type of stupa in Sri Lanka.\\r\\nAnother type of stupa is mentioned in the book \\"Manju Sri Vasthu Vidya Shastra\\"\\r\\ne.g.?: Nadigamvila stupa[5]\\r\\nKing Devanam Piya Tissa built the Thuparama dagaba to enshrine the Right Collar Bone of Lord Buddha. The Thuparama is regarded as the first ever historical stupa built in Sri Lanka.[1] Originally it was in the shape of a heap of paddy but as restorations were done in later years, it took the form as seen today. It has a diameter of 59?feet 6?inches (18.14?m) at the base. As the name suggests, Thuparama comprised a stupa and an arama, a residential complex. Ruins of such a complex can be seen within an area of over 3 acres (12,000?m2) around the stupa.\\r\\nThe stupas built later on were much larger than the Thuparama.It is accepted that the building of colossal stupas started during the reigh of King Dutugemunu. King Dutugemunu (161-137 BC) built the Mirisaveti which has a diameter of 168 feet (51?m) at the base and the most venerated stupa - Ruvanvali Mahaseya, also known as Ratnamali Mahathupa. While the base has a diameter of 289 feet (88?m), the height is given as 120 cubits (riyan), equivalent to around 300 feet (91?m). It took the form of bubbulakara or bubble shape. When the Abhyayagiri dagaba was originally built by King Vattagamani (Valagamba - 103 BC) it was not very large but later enlargements made it larger than the Mahathupa.\\r\\nKing Mahasena (276-303 CE) is credited with building the largest of them all - the Jetavana, which has a diameter of 367 feet (112?m) at the base. Though the present height is estimated at 232 feet (71?m), the original height is supposed to have been 400 feet. The main feature of Jetavana is its foundation, which goes all the way to the bedrock and 25 feet (7.6?m) deep. The height of Jetavana and the depth of the footing is approximately equal. Large stupas were also built at Mihintale at the site where Arahat Mahinda met the king, Magama, Dighavapi (near Ampara), Kataragama and other places. The builders of stupas in Sri Lanka had closely followed the designs of such monuments built in Sanchi and other places in India. In huge monuments, the dome rose from a triple-based platform. The dome was surmounted by a square railing of wood or stone which later became a cube of masonry. A stone pillar embedded in the dome rose above the railing. The stupa was crowned by an umbrella (chattra) or a series of umbrellas.\\r\\nThe Kantaka Chaitya in Mihintale is a fine example of a small dagoba. It features some of the finest stone carvings and terra cotta figures. They are well preserved to this day. The presence of a vahalkada or front piece is another interesting feature in this chaitya. There are carvings of animal figures, pot and foliage and other familiar ornamental motifs. These front pieces seen in most dagobas project from the base and face the cardinal points.\\r\\nIt can be observed that after the 4th century, the building of colossal dagobas has virtually ended. Thereafter smaller ones have been built using Thuparama in Anuradhapura as a model. This type came to be known as vatadage or rotunda. It is a circular relic house and apart from Thuparama and Lankarama in Anuradhapura, the best example is seen in Polonnaruwa.\\r\\nThere are two other beautiful ones at Medirigiriya close to Polonnaruwa and Tiriyaya off the Anuradhapura-Trincomalee road. These circular shrines enclosed stupas of smaller size and had wooden pillars right round. Later they were replaced by carved stone pillars. The pillars are arranged in four to two concentric circles, diminishing in size outwards.\\r\\nIt is important to examine the technology applied in the construction of stupas comprising the features mentioned above. Examining the building of the foundation of a stupa to suit its size, one can get an idea of the application of the knowledge of science and geometry prevalent in ancient times. The Jetavana excavations conducted recently confirm that the construction of the platform or base on which a stupa stands has been very solid and strong. The skill shown by the craftsmen in maintaining the shape of the stupa reveals the advanced state of technology prevalent at the time. One wonders how the materials used in building Jetavanaramaya could have been carried to such a height.[1]\\r\\nParanavitana, S, Stupa in Ceylon\\r\\nvon Schroeder, Ulrich. (1990).

He was scrupulous in documenting the sources of his works, which frequently combined stylistic influences from various performers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHandy was born in Florence, Alabama, the son of Elizabeth Brewer and Charles Barnard Handy. His father was the pastor of a small church in Guntersville, a small town in northeast central Alabama. Handy wrote in his 1941 autobiography, Father of the Blues, that he was born in the log cabin built by his grandfather William Wise Handy, who became an African Methodist Episcopal minister after emancipation. The log cabin of Handy's birth has been preserved near downtown Florence.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing up he apprenticed in carpentry, shoemaking and plastering. Handy was deeply religious, and his musical style was influenced by the church music he sang and played as a youth. It was also influenced by the sounds of the natural world. He cited as inspiration the sounds of \\"whippoorwills, bats and hoot owls and their outlandish noises\\", the sound of Cypress Creek washing on the fringes of the woodland, and \\"the music of every songbird and all the symphonies of their unpremeditated art\\".[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHandy's father believed that musical instruments were tools of the devil.[4] Without his parents' permission, Handy bought his first guitar, which he had seen in a local shop window and secretly saved for by picking berries and nuts and making lye soap. Upon seeing the guitar, his father asked him, \\"What possessed you to bring a sinful thing like that into our Christian home?\\" and ordered him to \\"take it back where it came from\\", but he also arranged for his son to take organ lessons. The organ lessons did not last long, but Handy moved on to learn to play the cornet. He joined a local band as a teenager, but he kept this fact a secret from his parents. He purchased a cornet from a fellow band member and spent every free minute practicing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe worked on a \\"shovel brigade\\" at the McNabb furnace and described the music made by the workers as they beat shovels, altering the tone while thrusting and withdrawing the metal part against the iron buggies to pass the time while waiting for the overfilled furnace to digest its ore. \\"With a dozen men participating, the effect was sometimes remarkable?... It was better to us than the music of a martial drum corps, and our rhythms were far more complicated.\\"[5] He wrote, \\"Southern Negroes sang about everything.?... They accompany themselves on anything from which they can extract a musical sound or rhythmical effect?...\\" He would later reflect that \\"In this way, and from these materials, they set the mood for what we now call blues\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1892, Handy travelled to Birmingham, Alabama, to take a teaching exam. He passed it easily, and gained a teaching job in the city. Learning that it paid poorly, he quit the position and found employment at a pipe works plant in nearby Bessemer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his time off from his job, he organized a small string orchestra and taught musicians how to read music. He later organized the Lauzetta Quartet. When the group read about the upcoming World's Fair in Chicago, they decided to attend. To pay their way, they performed odd jobs along the way. They arrived in Chicago only to learn that the World's Fair had been postponed for a year. Next they headed to St. Louis, Missouri, but found working conditions were bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the quartet disbanded, Handy went to Evansville, Indiana. He played the cornet in the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. In Evansville, Handy joined a successful band that performed throughout the neighboring cities and states. His musical endeavors were varied: he sang first tenor in a minstrel show, worked as a band director, choral director, cornetist and trumpeter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of 23, Handy became the bandmaster of Mahara's Colored Minstrels. In a three-year tour they traveled to Chicago, throughout Texas and Oklahoma, to Tennessee, Georgia and Florida, and on to Cuba. Handy was paid a salary of $6 per week. Returning from Cuba the band traveled north through Alabama, where they stopped to perform in Huntsville. Weary of life on the road, he and his wife, Elizabeth, decided to stay with relatives in his nearby hometown of Florence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1896, while performing at a barbecue in Henderson, Kentucky, Handy met Elizabeth Price. They married on July 19, 1896. She gave birth to Lucille, the first of their six children, on June 29, 1900, after they had settled in Florence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround that time, William Hooper Councill, the president of the Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes (AAMC) (now Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University), in Normal, Alabama, recruited Handy to teach music at the college. Handy became a faculty member in September 1900 and taught through much of 1902.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis enthusiasm for the distinctive style of uniquely American music, then often considered inferior to European classical music, was part of his development. He was disheartened to discover that the college emphasized teaching European music considered to be \\"classical\\". Handy felt he was underpaid and could make more money touring with a minstrel group.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1902 Handy traveled throughout Mississippi listening to various styles of black popular music. The state was mostly rural, and music was part of the cultureespecially in cotton plantations in the Mississippi Delta. Musicians usually played the guitar or banjo or, to a much lesser extent, piano. Handy's remarkable memory enabled him to recall and transcribe the music heard in his travels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a dispute with AAMC President Council, Handy resigned his teaching position to rejoin the Mahara Minstrels and tour the Midwest and Pacific Northwest. In 1903 he became the director of a black band organized by the Knights of Pythias, located in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Handy and his family lived there for six years. In 1903, while waiting for a train in Tutwiler, in the Mississippi Delta, Handy had the following experience: \\r\\n\\r\\nA lean loose-jointed Negro had commenced plunking a guitar beside me while I slept?... As he played, he pressed a knife on the strings of the guitar in a manner popularized by Hawaiian guitarists who used steel bars.?... The singer repeated the line three times, accompanying himself on the guitar with the weirdest music I had ever heard.[6][7]\\r\\nAbout 1905, while playing a dance in Cleveland, Mississippi, Handy was given a note asking for \\"our native music\\".[8] He played an old-time Southern melody, but was asked if a local colored band could play a few numbers. Three young men with a battered guitar, mandolin, and a worn-out bass took the stage.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey struck up one of those over and over strains that seem to have no beginning and certainly no ending at all. The strumming attained a disturbing monotony, but on and on it went, a kind of stuff associated with [sugar] cane rows and levee camps. Thump-thump-thump went their feet on the floor. It was not really annoying or unpleasant. Perhaps \\"haunting\\" is the better word.[9][11]\\r\\nHandy noted square dancing by Mississippi blacks with \\"one of their own calling the figures, and crooning all of his calls in the key of G.\\"[12] He remembered this when deciding on the key of \\"Saint Louis Blues\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the memory of that old gent who called figures for the Kentucky breakdownthe one who everlastingly pitched his tones in the key of G and moaned the calls like a presiding elder preaching at a revival meeting. Ah, there was my key?ÿ I'd do the song in G.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn describing \\"blind singers and footloose bards\\" around Clarksdale, Handy wrote,\\r\\nsurrounded by crowds of country folks, they would pour their hearts out in song?... They earned their living by selling their own songs  \\"ballets,\\" as they called them  and I'm ready to say in their behalf that seldom did their creations lack imagination.[14]\\r\\nIn 1909 Handy and his band moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where they played in clubs on Beale Street. The genesis of his \\"Memphis Blues\\" was a campaign song written for Edward Crump, a successful Memphis mayoral candidate in 1909 (and future political boss). Handy later rewrote the tune and changed its name from \\"Mr. Crump\\" to \\"Memphis Blues.\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1912 publication of the sheet music of his \\"Memphis Blues\\" introduced his style of 12-bar blues; it was credited as the inspiration for the foxtrot dance step by Vernon and Irene Castle, a New York dance team. Some consider it to be the first blues song. Handy sold the rights to the song for US$100. By 1914, when he was 40, he had established his musical style, his popularity had greatly increased, and he was a prolific composer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHandy wrote about using folk songs: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe primitive southern Negro, as he sang, was sure to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, it was always the same. Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect?... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major?..., and I carried this device into my melody as well?... This was a distinct departure, but as it turned out, it touched the spot.[15]\\r\\nThe three-line structure I employed in my lyric was suggested by a song I heard Phil Jones sing in Evansville?... While I took the three-line stanza as a model for my lyric, I found its repetition too monotonous?... Consequently I adopted the style of making a statement, repeating the statement in the second line, and then telling in the third line why the statement was made.[16]\\r\\nRegarding the \\"three-chord basic harmonic structure\\" of the blues, Handy wrote that the \\"(tonic, subdominant, dominant seventh) was that already used by Negro roustabouts, honky-tonk piano players, wanderers and others of the underprivileged but undaunted class from Missouri to the Gulf, and had become a common medium through which any such individual might express his personal feeling in a sort of musical soliloquy.\\"[15] He noted,\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the folk blues the singer fills up occasional gaps with words like 'Oh, lawdy' or 'Oh, baby' and the like. This meant that in writing a melody to be sung in the blues manner one would have to provide gaps or waits.[17]\\r\\nWriting about the first time \\"Saint Louis Blues\\" was played, in 1914, Handy said, \\r\\n\\r\\nThe one-step and other dances had been done to the tempo of Memphis Blues.?... When St Louis Blues was written the tango was in vogue. I tricked the dancers by arranging a tango introduction, breaking abruptly into a low-down blues. My eyes swept the floor anxiously, then suddenly I saw lightning strike. The dancers seemed electrified. Something within them came suddenly to life. An instinct that wanted so much to live, to fling its arms to spread joy, took them by the heels.[18]\\r\\nHis published musical works were groundbreaking because of his ethnicity, and he was among the first blacks to achieve economic success from publishing.[citation needed] In 1912, Handy met Harry H. Pace at the Solvent Savings Bank in Memphis. Pace was the valedictorian of his graduating class at Atlanta University and a student of W. E. B. Du Bois. By the time of their meeting, Pace had already demonstrated a strong understanding of business. He earned his reputation by recreating failing businesses. Handy liked him, and Pace later became the manager of Pace and Handy Sheet Music. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile in New York City, Handy wrote: \\r\\n\\r\\nI was under the impression that these Negro musicians would jump at the chance to patronize one of their own publishers. They didn't?... The Negro musicians simply played the hits of the day?... They followed the parade. Many white bands and orchestra leaders, on the other hand, were on the alert for novelties. They were therefore the ones most ready to introduce our numbers. [But] Negro vaudeville artists?... wanted songs that would not conflict with white acts on the bill. The result was that these performers became our most effective pluggers.[19]\\r\\nIn 1917, he and his publishing business moved to New York City, where he had offices in the Gaiety Theatre office building in Times Square.[20] By the end of that year, his most successful songs had been published: \\"Memphis Blues\\", \\"Beale Street Blues\\", and \\"Saint Louis Blues\\". That year the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, a white New Orleans jazz ensemble, had recorded the first jazz record, introducing the style to a wide segment of the American public. Handy initially had little fondness for this new form, jazz, but bands dove into his repertoire with enthusiasm, making many of them jazz standards.\\r\\n\\r\\nHandy encouraged performers such as Al Bernard, \\"a young white man\\" with a \\"soft Southern accent\\" who \\"could sing all my Blues\\". Handy sent Bernard to Thomas Edison to be recorded, which resulted in \\"an impressive series of successes for the young artist, successes in which we proudly shared.\\" Handy also published the original \\"Shake Rattle and Roll\\" and \\"Saxophone Blues\\", both written by Bernard. \\"Two young white ladies from Selma, Alabama (Madelyn Sheppard and Annelu Burns) contributed the songs \\"Pickaninny Rose\\" and \\"O Saroo\\", with the music published by Handy's company. These numbers, plus our blues, gave us a reputation as publishers of Negro music.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nExpecting to make only \\"another hundred or so\\" on a third recording of his, \\"Yellow Dog Blues\\" (originally entitled \\"Yellow Dog Rag\\"[22]\\r\\n), Handy signed a deal with the Victor company. The Joe Smith[23] recording of this song in 1919 became the best-selling recording of Handy's music to date.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nHandy tried to interest black women singers in his music but was initially unsuccessful. In 1920 Perry Bradford persuaded Mamie Smith to record two of his non-blues songs, published by Handy, accompanied by a white band: \\"That Thing Called Love\\" and \\"You Can't Keep a Good Man Down\\". When Bradford's \\"Crazy Blues\\" became a hit as recorded by Smith, African-American blues singers became increasingly popular. Handy's business began to decrease because of the competition.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1920 Pace amicably dissolved his long-standing partnership with Handy, with whom he also collaborated as lyricist. As Handy wrote,\\r\\n\\r\\nTo add to my woes, my partner withdrew from the business. He disagreed with some of my business methods, but no harsh words were involved. He simply chose this time to sever connection with our firm in order that he might organize Pace Phonograph Company, issuing Black Swan Records and making a serious bid for the Negro market.?... With Pace went a large number of our employees.?... Still more confusion and anguish grew out of the fact that people did not generally know that I had no stake in the Black Swan Record Company.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Handy's partnership with Pace was dissolved, he continued to operate the publishing company as a family-owned business. He published works of other black composers as well as his own, which included more than 150 sacred compositions and folk song arrangements and about 60 blues compositions.  In the 1920s, he founded the Handy Record Company in New York City. Bessie Smith's January 14, 1925, Columbia Records recording of \\"Saint Louis Blues\\" with Louis Armstrong is considered by many to be one of the finest recordings of the 1920s.[by whom?] So successful was Handy's \\"Saint Louis Blues\\" that in 1929, he and director Dudley Murphy collaborated on a RCA motion picture of the same name, which was to be shown before the main attraction. Handy suggested the blues singer Bessie Smith for the starring role, since she had gained widespread popularity with her recording of the song. The picture was filmed in June and was shown in movie houses throughout the United States from 1929 to 1932.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1926 Handy wrote and edited a work entitled Blues: An AnthologyComplete Words and Music of 53 Great Songs. It is probably the first work to attempt to record, analyze and describe the blues as an integral part of the South and the history of the United States. To celebrate the publication of the book and to honor Handy, Small's Paradise in Harlem hosted a party, \\"Handy Night\\", on Tuesday October 5, which contained the best of jazz and blues selections provided by the entertainers Adelaide Hall, Lottie Gee, Maude White and Chic Collins.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genre of the blues was a hallmark of American society and culture in the 1920s and 1930s. So great was its influence, and so much was it recognized as Handy's hallmark, that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in his novel The Great Gatsby that\\r\\n\\r\\nAll night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the \\"Beale Street Blues\\" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the gray tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.[citation needed][full citation needed][page?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the publication of his autobiography, Handy published a book on African-American musicians, Unsung Americans Sung (1944). He wrote three other books: Blues: An Anthology: Complete Words and Music of 53 Great Songs, Book of Negro Spirituals and Negro Authors and Composers of the United States,\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time, he lived on Strivers' Row in Harlem. He became blind following an accidental fall from a subway platform in 1943. After the death of his first wife, he remarried in 1954, when he was 80. His new bride was his secretary, the former Irma Louise Logan, who he frequently said had become his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1955, Handy suffered a stroke, after which he began to use a wheelchair. More than eight hundred attended his 84th birthday party at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 28, 1958, Handy died of bronchial pneumonia at Sydenham Hospital in New York City.[29] Over 25,000 people attended his funeral in Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church. Over 150,000 people gathered in the streets near the church to pay their respects. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, in the Bronx.\\r\\n\\r\\nHandy's music does not always follow the classic 12-bar pattern, often having 8- or 16-bar bridges between 12-bar verses.","input":"Who was considered the father of the blues?"},{"output":"migration","context":"A social space is physical or virtual space such as a social center, online social media, or other gathering place where people gather and interact. Some social spaces such as town squares or parks are public places; others such as pubs, websites. or shopping malls are privately owned and regulated.[1]\\r\\nHenri Lefebvre emphasised that in human society all 'space is social: it involves assigning more or less appropriated places to social relations....social space has thus always been a social product'.[2] Social space becomes thereby a metaphor for the very experience of social life - 'society experienced alternatively as a deterministic environment or force (milieu) and as our very element or beneficent shell (ambience)'.[3] In this sense 'social space spans the dichotomy between \\"public\\" and \\"private\\" space...is also linked to subjective and phenomenological space'.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs metaphor, 'social space contributes a relational rather than an abstract dimension...has received a large variety of attributes, interpretations, and metaphors'.[5] Such 'social space...i[s] an intricate space of obligations, duties, entitlements, prohibitions, debts, affections, insults, allies, contracts, enemies, infatuations, compromises, mutual love, legitimate expectations, and collective ideals'.[6]\\r\\nFor Lefebvre, 'the family, the school, the workplace, the church, and so on - each possesses an \\"appropriate\\" space...for a use specified within the social division of labor'.[7] Within such social spaces 'a system of \\"adapted\\" expectations and responses - rarely articulated as such because they seem obvious - acquire a quasi-natural self-evidence in everyday life and common sense': thus everybody consensually 'knows what he is talking about when he refers to the town hall, the post office, the police station, the grocery store, the bus and the train, train stations, and bistros' - all underlying aspects of 'a social space as such. an (artificial) edifice of hierarchically ordered institutions, of laws and conventions'.[8]\\r\\nDefining a stratified morphology as a series of 'discrete units embedded within one another in a definite order', one can see that a distinct 'morphology exists in social space - from the \\"room\\" or hut to the house and the building; from the building to the group of houses, to the village and the neighbourhood; from the neighbourhood to the city, the region, the nation, and the State...continent [&] planet'.[9]\\r\\nThe interaction of different levels may be symbiotic or it may be conflictual: as a Michigan cabinet member put it to two Southern colleagues shortly before the American Civil War, '\\"I see how it is; you are a Virginian and you are a South Carolinian; I am not a Michigander, I am an American\\"'.[10]\\r\\nFor the individual, as well as the social institution, different levels of social space come to the fore at different times. To a Britisher, for example, '\\"we\\" sometimes narrows to southern England, sometimes broadens to refer to \\"Britain and America\\" or \\"Europe\\" or \\"the west\\"'.[11] In precisely the same way, 'a resident of Rome may define himself with varying degrees of intensity as a Roman, an Italian, a Catholic, a Christian, a European, a Westerner'[12] - a sequence of stratified social spaces.\\r\\n'In premodern societies, space and place largely coincided....Modernity increasingly tears space away from place'.[13] Whereas in the premodern 'every thing has its assigned place in social space',[14] postmodernists would proudly proclaim that 'we need to substitute for the magisterial space of the past...a less upright, less Euclidean space where no one would ever be in his final place '.[15]\\r\\nThe way 'migration, seen as a metaphor, is everywhere' in postmodernity - 'we are migrants and perhaps hybrids, in but not of any situation in which we find ourselves'[16] - is rooted in the postmodern forms of production of social space.\\r\\nLefebvre considered globalization as the creation, and superimposition on nature, of 'worldwide-social space...with strong points (the centers) and weaker and dominated bases (the peripheries)'.[17]\\r\\nEducation, formal and informal, might be described as in large part a process whereby the new recruit to the human race 'must learn to represent the many dimensions of the local social space...through the veil of degraded inputs, chronic ambiguity, and the occasional deliberate deception'.[18] Faced with such intricacies, R. D. Laing concluded that 'it is just as well that man is a social animal, since the sheer complexity and contradiction of the social field in which he has to live is so formidable'.[19]\\r\\nThe madman, by contrast, is not 'someone to be counted on to know his place': in many ways, 'mental symptoms are wilful situational improprieties'.[20] Whereas in 'public and semi-public places - streets, shops, neighbourhoods, public transportation, and the like -...a fine mesh of obligations obtains which ensures the orderly traffic and co-mingling of participants...many classic symptoms of psychosis are precise and pointed violations of these territorial arrangements'.[21]\\r\\nLacan considered that 'it would be worthwhile mapping the places in social space that our culture has assigned to these [psychotic] subjects', and saw their difficulties as in part 'the effects of the breakdown produced by the symbolic discordances that characterize the complex structures of civilization':[22] what Goffman termed '\\"The Insanity of Place\\"'.[23]","input":"What is a common element of postmodern place?"},{"output":"March 2018","context":"","input":"When do the red hot chili peppers tour?"},{"output":"a decade before the events of the original Star Trek series and separate from the timeline of the concurrently produced feature films","context":"Star Trek: Discovery is an American television series created for CBS All Access by Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman. It is the first series developed specifically for that service, and the first Star Trek series since Star Trek: Enterprise concluded in 2005. Set roughly a decade before the events of the original Star Trek series and separate from the timeline of the concurrently produced feature films, Discovery explores the FederationÿKlingon war while following the crew of the USS Discovery.

Doug Jones, Shazad Latif, Anthony Rapp, Mary Wiseman, and Jason Isaacs also star. The new series was announced in November 2015, with Fuller joining as showrunner and wanting to make an anthology series. CBS asked him to make a single, serialized show first, with the prequel to the original series idea further developed. After further disagreements with CBS and struggles with other commitments, Fuller left the series in October 2016, replaced as showrunner by Berg and Harberts.\\r\\nStar Trek: Discovery premiered on September 19, 2017, at ArcLight Hollywood, before debuting on CBS and All Access on September 24. The rest of the 15-episode first season are streaming weekly on All Access. The series' release led to record subscriptions for All Access, and positive reviews from critics who highlighted Martin-Green's performance. A second season was ordered in October 2017.\\r\\nSet roughly ten years before the events of Star Trek: The Original Series,[1] the show sees the united Klingon houses in a war with the United Federation of Planets that involves the crew of the USS Discovery.[2][3]\\r\\nOn November 2, 2015, CBS announced a new Star Trek television series to premiere in January 2017, \\"on the heels\\" of the original series' 50th anniversary in 2016. It is the first Star Trek series since Star Trek: Enterprise concluded in 2005, and the first show to be developed specifically for the CBS All Access on demand service. Alex Kurtzman, co-writer of the films Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness, and Heather Kadin were set as executive producers on the series, which is \\"not related\\" to the 2016 film Star Trek Beyond.[28][29] The January 2017 date was the earliest that CBS could release a new Star Trek series after an agreement the company made when it split with Viacom in 2005.[30] Showtime, Netflix, and Amazon Video all offered \\"a lot of money\\" for the rights to release the series,[31] but after heavily investing in the new All Access service, CBS believed that a returning Star Trek could be \\"the franchise that really puts All Access on the map\\" and could earn more money in the long run.[30][31]\\r\\nIn January 2016, CBS president Glenn Geller revealed that he and the CBS network were not involved in the production of the series, saying, \\"It really is for All Access. While the network will be broadcasting the pilot, I actually can't answer any creative questions about it.\\"[32] The next month, Bryan Fuller, who began his career writing for the series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager, was announced as the new series' showrunner and co-creator alongside Kurtzman.[33][34] Nicholas Meyer, writer and director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, also joined the series as a writer and consulting producer.[35] In March, Rod Roddenberry, the son of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, and Trevor Roth of Roddenberry Entertainment also joined the series, as executive producers.[36] Fuller said that working with people previously involved with Star Trek was \\"really about making sure that we maintain authenticity\\", and said that Meyerwho is widely considered to have made the best Star Trek film in The Wrath of Khanbrings \\"a clarity and a cleanliness to the storytelling. An ability to ground science-fiction in a relatable way, and also making sure that we're telling character stories.\\"[37] Fuller had publicly called for Star Trek to return to television for years, particularly because of its impact on minority groups, as he explained, \\"I couldn't stop thinking about how many black people were inspired by seeing Nichelle Nichols on the bridge of a ship. I couldn't stop thinking about how many Asian people were inspired by seeing George Takei and feeling that gave them hope for their place in the future. I wanted to be part of that representation for a new era.\\"[38] When Fuller first met with CBS about the series, the company did not have a plan for what the new show would be.[39] He proposed an anthology series with each season being a standalone, serialized show set in a different era, beginning with a prequel to the original series, then stories set during the original series, during Star Trek: The Next Generation, and then \\"beyond to a time in Trek that's never been seen before\\". Fuller compared this to what American Horror Story did for horror, and described the proposal as a platform for \\"a universe of Trek shows\\". CBS instead suggested a single serialized show to see how that performed first, and he began further developing the concept of a prequel to the original series.[38]\\r\\nFuller announced in June 2016 that the first season would consist of 13 episodes,[39] though he would prefer to produce 10 episodes a season.[6] A month later, Fuller announced the series' title to be Star Trek: Discovery,[40] and revealed that it would be set in the \\"Prime Timeline\\" (which includes the previous Star Trek series, but not the modern reboot films) to keep the concurrent series and films separate, so \\"we don't have to track anything [happening in the films] and they don't have to track what we're doing\\".[41][6] Also in July, CBS Studios International licensed the series to Netflix for release outside the United States and Canada,[34] a \\"blockbuster\\" deal that paid for the show's entire budget (around US$6ÿ7 million per episode).[42][43] During pre-production on the series, Fuller and CBS continued to disagree on the direction of the show, which was starting to overrun its per-episode budget, and was falling behind schedule due to Fuller supervising all aspects of the series as well as another new show, American Gods. This caused frustration among CBS executives who felt Fuller should be focused on having Discovery ready for release by the January 2017 premiere date.[38] By August 2016, Fuller had hired Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts, who he had worked with on Pushing Daisies, to serve as co-showrunners with him.[6][43] A month later, he and Kurtzman asked CBS to delay the series' release so they could meet the high expectations for it, and the studio pushed the series premiere back to May 2017.\\"[44] At the end of October, CBS asked Fuller to step down as showrunner,[38] and announced a restructuring of the production: Berg and Harberts were made sole showrunners, working from a broad story arc and overall mythology established by Fuller; Kurtzman and Fuller would continue as executive producers, but with Fuller moving his attention fully to American Gods; and Akiva Goldsman would join the series in a supporting producer role, similar to the role he held on Fringe alongside Kurtzman. CBS reiterated that they were \\"extremely happy with [Fuller's] creative direction\\" for the series,[43] though some elements of the series that came directly from Fuller were dropped, including some designs and \\"more heavily allegorical and complex story\\" points.[38] Fuller later confirmed that he was no longer involved with the series, but expressed interest in returning for future seasons.[45]\\r\\nWith production set to finally begin in January, \\"a lot of careful deliberation [was] continuing to go into making Discovery special, from the choice of directors, to set design, to the special effects.\\"[46] Ted Sullivan also joined the series to serve as supervising writing producer.[47][48] At CBS's 2017 upfront presentation, CBS Interactive president Marc DeBevoise confirmed a \\"fall\\" release date for the series, and announced that the episode order for the first season had been expanded to 15 episodes.[49][50] In June, CBS announced a new premiere date of September 24, 2017, with the season airing through November 2017, and then beginning again in January 2018. This break gave more time to complete post-production on the second half of the season.[25] Also that month, Kurtzman said that he and Fuller had discussed future seasons before the latter's departure, and promised that \\"what's there in terms of story and certainly in terms of set-up, character, big ideas, the big movement of the season, that's all stuff that Bryan and I talked about\\" and would not be altered.[51] Goldsman said in August that the producers wanted \\"a hybridized [anthology] approach. I don't think we're looking for an endless, continuing nine or 10 year story. We're looking at arcs which will have characters that we know and characters that we don't know.\\"[8] Kurtzman added that the success of Discovery could lead to other new Star Trek series that could potentially use the anthology format.[52] By the end of August, Berg and Harberts had developed a \\"road map\\" for a second season, and \\"the beginnings of one\\" for a third. It was also revealed that an average episode of the first season had ultimately cost US$8ÿ8.5 million each, making it one of the most expensive television series ever and exceeding the original Netflix deal, though CBS still considered the series to be paid for already due to the number of new All Access subscribers that the show was expected to draw.[53] After the series' premiere, Kurtzman said that the producers wanted to avoid announcing release dates and having to delay those for any future seasons, due to the external pressure that caused with the first season, but that he hoped a second season would be available in early 2019.[54] The second season was officially ordered a month later in October 2017.[55]\\r\\nThe series' writers are based in Los Angeles,[57] and include \\"fans who all have very different relationships to Trek,\\" which Kurtzman said is \\"a healthy thing and it's a good thing\\".[51] Fuller wanted to differentiate the series from the previous 700+ episodes of Star Trek by taking advantage of the streaming format of All Access and telling a single story arc across the entire first season. He and Kurtzman developed this story from \\"so many elements of Star Trek\\", taking certain episodes of the original series and using their \\"DNA\\" to find \\"the spirit of what Star Trek offers, both in terms of high-concept science fiction storytelling and really wonderful metaphors for the human condition\\".[39] Berg said that the series' writers \\"are so in love with\\" The Original Series, The Next Generation, and the family aspect of those series, while Harberts added that Meyer's Star Trek films were an especial influence on Discovery because \\"his storytelling is complex and intellectual and yet there's a lot of room for character voices\\".[58]\\r\\nThe titular ship was named after Discovery One from 2001: A Space Odyssey, NASA's Space Shuttle Discovery, and \\"the sense of discovery ... what [that] means to Star Trek audiences who have been promised a future by Gene Roddenberry where we come together as a planet and seek new worlds and new alien races to explore and understand and collaborate with\\".[59] Fuller saw the series as a bridge between Enterprise and the original serieswhich are set around 150 years apartbut set much closer to the latter to allow the series to \\"play with all the iconography of those ships and those uniforms\\".[60] In May 2017, Sullivan described the series as \\"a genuine prequel\\" to the original series,[61] with Goldsman later adding that there were many classic Star Trek elements that fans among the writers wished to include in the series, but couldn't because they were included in the original series as something being discovered by Starfleet for the first time then.[62] The choice to feature a single serialized story throughout the first season was inspired by the general change in television to tell more realistic and serialized stories rather than the \\"new destination-based adventure each week\\" format mostly used in previous Star Trek series. Fuller had been one of several writers during the 1990s pushing for Deep Space Nine and Voyager to move towards this style.[63] Also inspired by modern, \\"peak television\\" series such as Game of Thrones was a willingness to kill off major characters for dramatic reasons, though the writers wanted to avoid doing so gratuitously or for \\"shock value\\".[64]\\r\\nFuller said the series could \\"push the content envelope since it won't be constrained by broadcast standards\\", but \\"it's still Star Trek. It will probably be slightly more graphic content ... I imagine we're going to shoot scenes a couple of ways and see what feels more authentic in the editing room.\\"[1] Harberts ultimately described the series as a \\"hard PG-13\\", saying the series could include \\"some violent things or [a] tiny bit of language\\" but they still wanted the show to be for families and to \\"honor what the franchise is.\\"[65] On using time travel in the series, a plot device used in at least two episodes of every previous live-action Star Trek season, Fuller said that it had not yet been used for any episode by the end of August 2016, and, \\"You never know when you want to pull out that device but I am not anticipating an over-reliance on time travel to tell this season's stories.\\"[6] The series' writers also chose to ignore Gene Roddenberry's longstanding rule that Starfleet crew members not have any significant conflict with one another or be depicted negatively (a rule that Roddenberry himself did not always strictly follow). Harberts explained, \\"We're trying to do stories that are complicated, with characters with strong points of view and strong passions. People have to make mistakesmistakes are still going to be made in the future. We're still going to argue in the future ... the thing we're taking from Roddenberry is how we solve those conflicts.\\"[63] Because of the show's position as a prequel to the original series, the producers felt it was more important for Discovery to build towards Roddenberry's ideals, and to show that \\"you can't simply be accepting and tolerant without working for it, and so this show is about that struggle.\\"[62]\\r\\nBy June 2016, Fuller had met with several actors, and said that \\"we want to carry on what Star Trek does best, which is being progressive. So it's fascinating to look at all of these roles through a colorblind prism and a gender-blind prism\\".[39] A month later, Kadin clarified that the series would feature minority, female, and LGBTQ characters.[66] In August, Fuller said the series would feature \\"about seven\\" lead characters,[67] and would star a lieutenant commander, rather than a starship captain like previous Star Trek series, to be played by a non-white actress. He said the series would also include more alien characters than other Star Trek series, and would feature at least one openly gay character. Fuller, who is gay himself, had been determined to see this happen since receiving hate mail while working on Voyager when a character on that show was rumored to be coming out as gay.[1] By this time, Fuller had discussed the series' casting with Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space (who made a cameo appearance in an episode of The Next Generation).[1][68]\\r\\nFuller anticipated casting announcements in October 2016,[6] but none had been made by the end of that month. The majority of the series main characters were believed to have been cast by then, but no actress had been cast for the series' lead role. This was a source of \\"some internal stress\\" at CBS.[43] Several African American and Latina actresses were being looked at for the role, with CBS \\"not seeking a huge star and [preferring] a fresh face for the part.\\"[69] In October, the cast was believed to include \\"a female admiral, a male Klingon captain, a male admiral, a male adviser and a British male doctor\\", with one of those male leads played by an openly gay actor.[70] The next month, Doug Jones and Anthony Rapp were revealed to be cast, as Science Officers Saru and Stamets, respectively.[9] The former is a Kelpien, an alien race created for the series,[10] while the latter is the first Star Trek character to be conceived and announced as gay.[9] Sonequa Martin-Green was cast in the lead role in December,[71] which was officially confirmed in April 2017, with the character's name revealed to be Michael Burnham.[5] Also in December, Shazad Latif was cast as the Klingon Kol.[72] In March 2017, Jason Isaacs was cast as Captain Lorca of the USS Discovery,[22] and Mary Wiseman joined as Tilly, a cadet.[19] At the end of April, Latif was revealed to have been recast to the role of Starfleet Lieutenant Tyler.[12]\\r\\nMark Worthington and Todd Cherniawsky served as initial production designers for the series;[73] Gersha Phillips and Suttirat Anne Larlarb designed the costumes;[3][74] veteran Star Trek designer John Eaves designed starships, along with Scott Schneider;[75][76] and Glenn Hetrick and Neville Page of Alchemy Studios provided prosthetics, props, and armor.[3][77] Page previously served as the concept and creature designer on the three \\"Kelvin Timeline\\" Star Trek films.[78] The series also employed seven art directors, over nine illustrators, more than thirty-five set designers, and over four hundred and fifty painters, carpenters, sculptors, model makers, welders, set dressers, and prop builders.[76]\\r\\nFuller said on the general approach to design on the show, \\"we're producing the show in 2016. We have to update the style of the effects, the style of the sets, the style of the makeup ... all of the other series have been produced [at a time that] isn't as sophisticated as we are now with what we can do production-wise, we're going to be reestablishing an entire look for the series\\" and for Star Trek moving forward.[1] Fuller had wanted the series' uniforms to reflect the primary colors of the original series, but this was discarded after his departure.[38] However, Fuller's designs for the Klingons, which he \\"really, really wanted\\" to redesign, were retained.[8][2] 3D Systems' \\"cutting edge\\" 3D printing techniques were widely used in the making of the series.[3][78] For the prosthetics, Page and Hetrick took detailed laser scans of the actors so they could simulate make-up and prosthetics in a virtual environment before creating the practical version.[79] Fabric for the Starfleet uniforms seen in the series were custom-dyed in Switzerland; the costumes were cut and assembled in Toronto by Phillips and her department. The main uniforms seen in the series are a navy blue specifically mixed for the show, with gold or silver embellishments depending on the division of the officer. Medical officers wear a \\"hospital white\\" variant, also custom-dyed in Switzerland, while the captain's uniform is the standard navy blue but with additional gold piping on the shoulders.[80] Starfleet insignia badges were molded from silicon bronze, and then polished and plated by a jeweler to create custom colors for the series, based on the division of the officer wearing the uniform: gold for command, silver for sciences and medical, and copper for operations. Props such as tricorders and hand scanners, communicators, and phasers were produced with 3D printing and heavily inspired by their designs in the original Star Trek series.[80]\\r\\nThe design of the USS Discovery is based on an unused Ralph McQuarrie design for the USS Enterprise from the unproduced film Star Trek: Planet of the Titans, which Fuller had noted in July 2016 was \\"to a point that we can't legally comment on it until [our legal team] figures out some things\\".[41] McQuarrie's designs were based on the concepts created by Ken Adam to feature a vessel with a flattened secondary hull.[81][82] Fuller wanted \\"something distinct about what our Star Trek was going to look\\" like, and after seeing McQuarrie's design \\"saw sort of harder lines of a ship and started talking about race cars and Lamborghinis in the '70s and James Bond cars and started working on the designs, taking those inspirations and coming up with something completely unique to us.\\"[83] The design for the Discovery went through several revisions and refinements before the final version was approved in December 2016.[84] The sickbay on the Discovery was inspired by that of the Enterprise from the original series.[85] Other Federation starships created for the show include the USS Shenzhou and the USS Europa.[86][87] Sets for the Discovery's interiors were described as a \\"tangle of corridors and rooms\\",[53] and were designed to match with the exterior design of the ship, so \\"the rooms [could believably] fit inside the house\\", but there was some artistic license taken in places. The graphics used for the Starfleet computer systems were designed to be believably more advanced than modern technology, but to also \\"honor the look and feel\\" of the designs used in previous series. The initial colors allowed for the graphics were mostly restricted to blues, with the intention of these becoming more colorful the closer the series gets to the time period of the original series.[76]\\r\\nStar Trek: Discovery is filmed at Pinewood Toronto Studios,[88] with Vincenzo Natali serving as producing director for the series.[39] Some of the series' sets took over six weeks to create,[86] and new sets were being built up until the end of production of the season.[89] Discovery took advantage of multiple soundstages at the studio, including the largest soundstage in North America.[53] Some episodes for the show were filmed solely on existing sets, making them bottle episodes, though Harberts said the series would not do anything \\"as bottle-y as 'everyone is stuck in the mess hall!'\\"[89]\\r\\nFor the visual scope of the series, Kurtzman felt that the show had to \\"justify being on a premium cable service\\".[90] The showrunners were particularly inspired by Star Trek: The Motion Picture and its \\"wider scope\\", with Harberts explaining that the series is shot in a 2:1 aspect ratio which \\"just lends itself to a very lyrical way of telling the story.\\" He added that some of the series' visuals were influenced by the modern Star Trek films from J. J. Abrams.[58] Some of these influences, per Goldsman, are \\"the ability to be creative cinematicallythe intimate discourse, the humanistic storytelling with the giant canvas that is Star Trek. A more kinetic camera, a more dynamic way of existing, a much greater use of practical sets so when youre running down a corridor, youre running down a corridor. A sense of rhythmthere is a sense of litheness, a kind of fluidity in the characterizations.\\"[91] The producers worked closely with pilot director David Semel to make the series look as cinematic as possible, including filming the bridge of Starfleet's ships in such a way as \\"not to shoot in a sort of proscenium boxto be able to get the camera into spaces where, you know, to shoot it in interesting ways, which is a combination of choreographing a scene to motivate the camera moving, and also lighting.\\"[56] The cinematographers for the series wanted to emphasize on set sourcing, with lighting built in wherever it would naturally appear to help create a more realistic feel, and distance the series from the \\"stage\\" feel of the original series.[89] The lighting could also be controlled to create completely different situations, such as the lighting of a Starfleet red alert.[76] Harberts said that the cinematographers wanted the series to have a \\"Rembrandt texture\\".[89]\\r\\nVisual effects producers were hired to begin work on the series during the initial writing period, with Fuller explaining that the series would require such things as \\"digital augmentation on certain alien species\\" and \\"the transporter beams\\". He said, \\"We're trying to cultivate distinct looks for all of those things that are unique to our version of Star Trek and carry through the themes we love seeing in fifty years of Star Trek, but doing a slightly different approach.\\"[39] Pixomondo is the primary visual effects vendor for the series,[87] with Spin VFX also working on the show.[92] Kurtzman noted that the series utilizes multiple CG environments which take several months to properly render.[56] The shuttle bay of the Discovery is completely computer-generated, with actors performing in front of a green screen for scenes in that environment; using the digital set is more expensive than any other set created for the series, including the practically-built ones.[93]\\r\\nThe first teaser for the series featured music composed by Fil Eisler, which he \\"threw together as an audition\\" within three weeks.[66] Before production on the series began, Charles Henri Avelange had also composed and recorded music for the series, which he described as \\"a showcase for CBS\\".[94] In July 2017, Jeff Russo was announced as composer for the series.[7] Russo recorded the series' score with a 60-piece orchestra.[90] The show's main theme incorporates elements from the original Star Trek theme.[62]\\r\\nThe first episode of Star Trek: Discovery aired in a \\"preview broadcast\\" on CBS in the United States on September 24, as well as being made available with the second episode on CBS All Access. Subsequent first-run episodes, making up the first chapter of the season, were streamed weekly on All Access through November 12. The second chapter will begin streaming January 2018.[25][26][95]\\r\\nCBS Studios International licensed the series to Bell Media for broadcast in Canada, and to Netflix for another 188 countries.[34] In Canada, the premiere was simulcast with CBS on September 24, 2017, on both the CTV Television Network and on the specialty channel Space before being streamed on CraveTV; it was also broadcast in French on the specialty channel Z.[34] Subsequent episodes will be released through Space, Z, and CraveTV,[34] with Space airing each episode 30 minutes before it's streamed on All Access.[96][97] In the other countries, Netflix will release each episode of the series for streaming within 24 hours of its U.S. debut.[34] This agreement also saw Bell Media and Netflix acquire all previous Star Trek series to stream in their entirety, and to broadcast on Bell Media television channels.[34]\\r\\nThe first full trailer for the series was released in May 2017.[98] Forbes's Merrill Barr noted that the trailer was a good sign for many who believed the series would never be released following the many production setbacks and delays, saying, \\"Having a legitimate trailer that can be watched over and over again brings signs of hope, particularly for fans that have been waiting over a year for this moment. Star Trek: Discovery is real, and now we have proof.\\"[99] Chris Harnick of E! News described the trailer as \\"gorgeous\\" and \\"truly cinematic\\", and because of the appearances of Sarek and the Klingons in the footage, \\"this is the Star Trek you know and love.\\"[100] Aja Romano at Vox called the trailer's visuals \\"sumptuous\\" and \\"modern, but still very much in keeping with the aesthetic of previous Trek series\\". She continued, \\"What gets short shrift in this trailer is the series' overarching plot ... In any case, seeing the Klingons in all their combative glory feels a bit like coming home for Trek fans.\\"[101] Also in May, McFarlane Toys signed a toy license deal with CBS to produce \\"figures, role play weapons and accessories\\" for Discovery. CBS Consumer Products senior vice president Veronica Hart explained that McFarlane was chosen as the first licensee for the series because of its \\"commitment to quality and dedication to fans\\". The deal will also see the company \\"create merchandise from the entire Star Trek universe, ranging from the classic Star Trek: The Original Series to its popular movie franchise.\\" The first merchandise produced under the deal are set for release in mid-2018.[102]\\r\\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the CBS broadcast of the first episode was watched by a \\"decent\\" audience of 9.5 million viewers.[103][104] The premiere of the series led to record subscriptions for All Access, with the service having its biggest day of signups, as well as its biggest week and month of signups thanks to the series.[105] According to \\"app analytics specialist\\" App Annie, the premiere of the series also caused the number of downloads of the All Access mobile app to more than double, with revenue from the app for CBS doubling compared to the average in-app revenue during the previous 30 days.[106]\\r\\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 83% approval rating for the first season, with an average rating of 7.13/10 based on 51 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Although it takes an episode to achieve liftoff, Star Trek: Discovery delivers a solid franchise installment for the next generationboldly led by the charismatic Sonequa Martin-Green.\\"[107] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 72 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[108]\\r\\nBy July 2016, CBS was working on an aftershow companion series to Discovery similar in format to AMC's Talking Dead, a companion to The Walking Dead. The show would air live after each episode of Discovery, and would feature \\"guests, celebrity Trekkies, former Star Trek actors, along with cast members and crew\\" from Discovery.[109] The companion series was confirmed in 2017, with the title After Trek and host Matt Mira. It is produced by Embassy Row in association with Roddenberry Entertainment.[110]\\r\\nIn September 2016, Discovery writer Kirsten Beyer announced that CBS was working with IDW and Simon & Schuster to produce more content revolving around the setting of the series, starting with at least one novel and a comic series tied to the television show. Beyer, the writer of many Star Trek: Voyager novels, explained that she would work with fellow Star Trek novelist David Mack and Star Trek comic writer Mike Johnson to ensure that all three media \\"are coming from the same place\\". The release of the books and comics was set to coincide with the series' premiere.[111] Mack described writing around the continuity of Discovery as \\"tricky to get right\\", as the time period \\"is light on detail and almost unique within the Star Trek continuity. That made it a challenge to represent that era faithfully while also staying true to the new elements being introduced\\" in the new series.[112]\\r\\nIn August 2017, Beyer explained the series' writers' intentions for the additional content, saying, \\"We want to be able to take the story opportunities that we're just frankly not going to have time to cover in the show, and go as deep into those into the various formats as we can. It's not that you have to read these stories to understand everything, but the story will be incredibly enhanced if you do.\\" Regarding whether this content would be considered canonical, Beyer said that the stories of the comics and novels are briefed back to the show's writing staff so \\"the stories we created get integrated into their brains\\", but she also said, \\"Because of the collaborative nature of this process, we're able to go farther, take bigger risks. The danger is that, in the future, somebody will come upon with an amazing story idea that would be incompatible with what we've already established and just like always, the series is going to take priority. But the hope is that we can carve out these places that are safe and that we can continue to protect because as much as possible we want this to be one integrated universewe're doing what we can to make sure these stories all fit together moving forward.\\"[113]\\r\\nThe first tie-in to the show is Desperate Hours, a prequel set a year before Discovery and a year after \\"The Cage\\". Written by Mack, the novel was released on September 26, and follows Burnham as she serves aboard the Shenzhou. Fuller had asked for a book to be written based on that premise, and Mack had worked with the Discovery writers to stay \\"in the loop throughout the season with all the scripts and the story development. There were a few false starts, but eventually it allowed us to collaboratively create this story\\". Mack hinted that the USS Enterprise could also appear in the novel. The second Discovery novel is being written by Dayton Ward, is set 10 years before the show, and is intended to be released in early 2018.[113]\\r\\nIn July 2017, IDW announced the first tie-in comic series, also titled Star Trek: Discovery, to be written by Johnson and Beyer with art by Tony Shasteen, who previously worked with Johnson on the comic Star Trek: Boldly Go. IDW described the comic as \\"Klingon-centric\\", and set the first issue for release on October 25.[114] Johnson compared working with Beyer on the comic to his work on the Star Trek: Countdown comic, a tie-in to the 2009 Star Trek film that he wrote with Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, saying that her position as a staff writer on the Discovery show \\"means we have all the inside access that we need. So the story in the comic will really matter and not just feel like a one-off. It is actually able to expand the story you guys are going to see in the show itself.\\"[115]\\r\\nIn August, it was clarified that the first comic would be a four-issue miniseries focused on T'Kuvma and his followers, and that IDW intended to create a series of comic miniseries based on different aspects of the series to create \\"targeted stories on some different subjects\\". Johnson stated that they were \\"building out the characters in the Klingon world with these comics, and we can't wait to show you.\\" He added that discussions were being held regarding the subject of the next miniseries. IDW editor Sarah Gaydos said, \\"The access we're getting to the show to create these comics that are integral to fleshing out the backstories of the characters is unheard of, and I do a lot of licensed comics.\\"[113]\\r\\nIn late 2017, \\"hours\\" of Discovery-based content will be added to the role playing video game Star Trek Timelines, including Michael Burnham and Saru as new crew members for the game and new ships from the show, both Federation and otherwise. A month long \\"Mega-Event\\" based on the series will also take place.[116]","input":"What period does star trek discovery take place?"},{"output":"15 August 1995","context":"India's telecommunication network is the second largest in the world by number of telephone users (both fixed and mobile phone) with 1.053 billion subscribers as on 31 August 2016. It has one of the lowest call tariffs in the world enabled by mega telecom operators and hyper-competition among them. India has the world's second-largest Internet user-base. As on 31 March 2016, there were 342.65 million internet subscribers in the country.[7]\\r\\nMajor sectors of the Indian telecommunication industry are telephone, internet and television broadcast Industry in the country which is in an ongoing process of transforming into next generation network, employs an extensive system of modern network elements such as digital telephone exchanges, mobile switching centres, media gateways and signalling gateways at the core, interconnected by a wide variety of transmission systems using fibre-optics or Microwave radio relay networks. The access network, which connects the subscriber to the core, is highly diversified with different copper-pair, optic-fibre and wireless technologies. DTH, a relatively new broadcasting technology has attained significant popularity in the Television segment. The introduction of private FM has given a fillip to the radio broadcasting in India. Telecommunication in India has greatly been supported by the INSAT system of the country, one of the largest domestic satellite systems in the world. India possesses a diversified communications system, which links all parts of the country by telephone, Internet, radio, television and satellite.[8]\\r\\nIndian telecom industry underwent a high pace of market liberalisation and growth since the 1990s and now has become the world's most competitive and one of the fastest growing telecom markets.[9][10] The Industry has grown over twenty times in just ten years, from under 37 million subscribers in the year 2001 to over 846 million subscribers in the year 2011.[11] India has the world's second-largest mobile phone user base with over 929.37 million users as of May 2012.[8] It has the world's second-largest Internet user-base with over 300 million as of June 2015.[12][13]\\r\\nTelecommunication has supported the socioeconomic development of India and has played a significant role to narrow down the rural-urban digital divide to some extent. It also has helped to increase the transparency of governance with the introduction of e-governance in India. The government has pragmatically used modern telecommunication facilities to deliver mass education programmes for the rural folk of India.[14]\\r\\nAccording to London-based telecom trade body GSMA, the telecom sector accounted for 6.5% of India's GDP in 2015, or about ?9 lakh crore (US$140?billion), and supported direct employment for 2.2 million people in the country. GSMA estimates that the Indian telecom sector will contribute ?14.5 lakh crore (US$230?billion) to the economy and support 3 million direct jobs and 2 million indirect jobs by 2020.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTelecommunications in India began with the introduction of the telegraph. The Indian postal and telecom sectors are one of the worlds oldest. In 1850, the first experimental electric telegraph line was started between Calcutta and Diamond Harbour. In 1851, it was opened for the use of the British East India Company. The Posts and Telegraphs department occupied a small corner of the Public Works Department,[16] at that time.\\r\\nThe construction of 4,000 miles (6,400?km) of telegraph lines was started in November 1853. These connected Kolkata (then Calcutta) and Peshawar in the north; Agra, Mumbai (then Bombay) through Sindwa Ghats, and Chennai (then Madras) in the south; Ootacamund and Bangalore. William O'Shaughnessy, who pioneered the telegraph and telephone in India, belonged to the Public Works Department, and worked towards the development of telecom throughout this period. A separate department was opened in 1854 when telegraph facilities were opened to the public.\\r\\nIn 1880, two telephone companies namely The Oriental Telephone Company Ltd. and The Anglo-Indian Telephone Company Ltd. approached the Government of India to establish telephone exchange in India. The permission was refused on the grounds that the establishment of telephones was a Government monopoly and that the Government itself would undertake the work. In 1881, the Government later reversed its earlier decision and a licence was granted to the Oriental Telephone Company Limited of England for opening telephone exchanges at Calcutta, Bombay, Madras and Ahmedabad and the first formal telephone service was established in the country.[17] On 28 January 1882, Major E. Baring, Member of the Governor General of India's Council declared open the Telephone Exchanges in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras. The exchange in Calcutta named the \\"Central Exchange\\" had a total of 93 subscribers in its early stage. Later that year, Bombay also witnessed the opening of a telephone exchange.[18]\\r\\nDevelopment of Broadcasting: Radio broadcasting was initiated in 1927 but became state responsibility only in 1930. In 1937 it was given the name All India Radio and since 1957 it has been called Akashvani.[20] Limited duration of television programming began in 1959, and complete broadcasting followed in 1965. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting owned and maintained the audio-visual apparatusincluding the television channel Doordarshanin the country prior to the economic reforms of 1991. In 1997, an autonomous body was established in the name of Prasar Bharti to take care of the public service broadcasting under the Prasar Bharti Act. All India Radio and Doordarshan, which earlier were working as media units under the Ministry of I&B became constituents of the body.[14]\\r\\nPre-liberalisation statistics: While all the major cities and towns in the country were linked with telephones during the British period, the total number of telephones in 1948 numbered only around 80,000. Post independence, growth remained slow because the telephone was seen more as a status symbol rather than being an instrument of utility. The number of telephones grew leisurely to 980,000 in 1971, 2.15 million in 1981 and 5.07 million in 1991, the year economic reforms were initiated in the country.\\r\\nLiberalisation of Indian telecommunication in industry started in 1981 when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi signed contracts with Alcatel CIT of France to merge with the state owned Telecom Company (ITI), in an effort to set up 5,000,000 lines per year. But soon the policy was let down because of political opposition.[21] Attempts to liberalise the telecommunication industry were continued by the following government under the prime-minister-ship of Rajiv Gandhi. He invited Sam Pitroda, a US-based Non-resident Indian NRI and a former Rockwell International executive to set up a Centre for Development of Telematics(C-DOT) which manufactured electronic telephone exchanges in India for the first time.[22] Sam Pitroda had a significant role as a consultant and adviser in the development of telecommunication in India.[23]\\r\\nIn 1985, the Department of Telecom(DoT) was separated from Indian Post & Telecommunication Department. DoT was responsible for telecom services in entire country until 1986 when Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) and Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL) were carved out of DoT to run the telecom services of metro cities(Delhi and Mumbai) and international long distance operations respectively.[22]\\r\\nThe demand for telephones was ever increasing and in the 1990s Indian government was under increasing pressure to open up the telecom sector for private investment as a part of Liberalisation-Privatisation-Globalisation policies that the government had to accept to overcome the severe fiscal crisis and resultant balance of payments issue in 1991. Consequently, private investment in the sector of Value Added Services (VAS) was allowed and cellular telecom sector were opened up for competition from private investments. It was during this period that the Narsimha Rao-led government introduced the National Telecommunications policy (NTP) in 1994 which brought changes in the following areas: ownership, service and regulation of telecommunications infrastructure. The policy introduced the concept of telecommunication for all and its vision was to expand the telecommunication facilities to all the villages in India.[24] Liberalisation in the basic telecom sector was also envisaged in this policy.[25] They were also successful in establishing joint ventures between state owned telecom companies and international players. Foreign firms were eligible to 49% of the total stake. The multi-nationals were just involved in technology transfer, and not policy making.[21]\\r\\nDuring this period, the World Bank and ITU had advised the Indian Government to liberalise long distance services to release the monopoly of the state owned DoT and VSNL and to enable competition in the long distance carrier business which would help reduce tariff's and better the economy of the country. The Rao run government instead liberalised the local services, taking the opposite political parties into confidence and assuring foreign involvement in the long distance business after 5 years. The country was divided into 20 telecommunication circles for basic telephony and 18 circles for mobile services. These circles were divided into category A, B and C depending on the value of the revenue in each circle. The government threw open the bids to one private company per circle along with government owned DoT per circle. For cellular service two service providers were allowed per circle and a 15 years licence was given to each provider. During all these improvements, the government did face oppositions from ITI, DoT, MTNL, VSNL and other labour unions, but they managed to keep away from all the hurdles.[21]\\r\\nIn 1997, the government set up TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) which reduced the interference of Government in deciding tariffs and policy making. The political powers changed in 1999 and the new government under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee was more pro-reforms and introduced better liberalisation policies. In 2000, the Vajpayee government constituted the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) through an amendment of the TRAI Act, 1997.[26][27] The primary objective of TDSAT's establishment was to release TRAI from adjudicatory and dispute settlement functions in order to strengthen the regulatory framework. Any dispute involving parties like licensor, licensee, service provider and consumers are resolved by TDSAT. Moreover, any direction, order or decision of TRAI can be challenged by appealing in TDSAT.[28] The government corporatised the operations wing of DoT on 1 October 2000 and named it as Department of Telecommunication Services (DTS) which was later named as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). The proposal of raising the stake of foreign investors from 49% to 74% was rejected by the opposite political parties and leftist thinkers. Domestic business groups wanted the government to privatise VSNL. Finally in April 2002, the government decided to cut its stake of 53% to 26% in VSNL and to throw it open for sale to private enterprises. TATA finally took 25% stake in VSNL.[21]\\r\\nThis was a gateway to many foreign investors to get entry into the Indian Telecom Markets. After March 2000, the government became more liberal in making policies and issuing licences to private operators. The government further reduced licence fees for cellular service providers and increased the allowable stake to 74% for foreign companies. Because of all these factors, the service fees finally reduced and the call costs were cut greatly enabling every common middle-class family in India to afford a cell phone. Nearly 32 million handsets were sold in India. The data reveals the real potential for growth of the Indian mobile market.[29] Many private operators, such as Reliance Communications, Jio, Tata Indicom, Vodafone, Loop Mobile, Airtel, Idea etc., successfully entered the high potential Indian telecom market.\\r\\nIn March 2008 the total GSM and CDMA mobile subscriber base in the country was 375 million, which represented a nearly 50% growth when compared with previous year.[30] As the unbranded Chinese cell phones which do not have International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers pose a serious security risk to the country, Mobile network operators therefore suspended the usage of around 30 million mobile phones (about 8% of all mobiles in the country) by 30 April. Phones without valid IMEI cannot be connected to cellular operators.[31] 5ÿ6 years the average monthly subscribers additions were around 0.05 to 0.1 million only and the total mobile subscribers base in December 2002 stood at 10.5 millions. However, after a number of proactive initiatives taken by regulators and licensors, the total number of mobile subscribers has increased rapidly to over 929 million subscribers as of May 2012.\\r\\nIndia has opted for the use of both the GSM (global system for mobile communications) and CDMA (code-division multiple access) technologies in the mobile sector. In addition to landline and mobile phones, some of the companies also provide the WLL service. The mobile tariffs in India have also become the lowest in the world. A new mobile connection can be activated with a monthly commitment of US$0.15 only. In 2005 alone additions increased to around 2 million per month in 2003ÿ04 and 2004ÿ05.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe telephony segment is dominated by private-sector and two state-run businesses. Most companies were formed by a recent revolution and restructuring launched within a decade, directed by Ministry of Communications and IT, Department of Telecommunications and Minister of Finance. Since then, most companies gained 2G, 3G and 4G licences and engaged fixed-line, mobile and internet business in India. On landlines, intra-circle calls are considered local calls while inter-circle are considered long distance calls. Foreign Direct Investment policy which increased the foreign ownership cap from 49% to 74%.Now it is 100%. The Government is working to integrate the whole country in one telecom circle. For long distance calls, the area code prefixed with a zero is dialled first which is then followed by the number (i.e., to call Delhi, 011 would be dialled first followed by the phone number). For international calls, \\"00\\" must be dialled first followed by the country code, area code and local phone number. The country code for India is 91. Several international fibre-optic links include those to Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Russia, and Germany. Some major telecom operators in India include Airtel, Vodafone, Idea, Aircel, BSNL, MTNL, Reliance Communications, TATA Teleservices, Infotel, MTS, Uninor, TATA DoCoMo, Videocon, Augere, Tikona Digital.\\r\\nHitherto the New Telecom Policy was announced in 1999, only the Government-owned BSNL and MTNL were allowed to provide land-line phone services through copper wire in India with MTNL operating in Delhi and Mumbai and BSNL servicing all other areas of the country. Due to the rapid growth of the cellular phone industry in India, landlines are facing stiff competition from cellular operators. This has forced land-line service providers to become more efficient and improve their quality of service. Land-line connections are now also available on demand, even in high density urban areas. India has over 31 million main line customers.\\r\\nIn August 1995, then Chief Minister of West Bengal, Jyoti Basu made the first mobile phone call in India to then Union Telecom Minister Sukhram.[32] Sixteen years later 4th generation services were launched in Kolkata.[33]\\r\\nWith a subscriber base of more than 929 million, the Mobile telecommunications system in India is the second largest in the world and it was thrown open to private players in the 1990s. GSM was comfortably maintaining its position as the dominant mobile technology with 80% of the mobile subscriber market, but CDMA seemed to have stabilised its market share at 20% for the time being. By May 2012 the country had 929 million mobile subscribers, up from 350 million just 40 months earlier. The mobile market was continuing to expand at an annual rate in excess of 40% coming into 2010.\\r\\nThe country is divided into multiple zones, called circles (roughly along state boundaries). Government and several private players run local and long distance telephone services. Competition has caused prices to drop and calls across India are one of the cheapest in the world.[34] The rates are supposed to go down further with new measures to be taken by the Information Ministry.[35] Call drop fine: Telcos warn of raising tariff.[36] In September 2004, the number of mobile phone connections crossed the number of fixed-line connections and presently dwarfs the wireline segment by a ratio of around 20:1. The mobile subscriber base has grown by a factor of over a hundred and thirty, from 5 million subscribers in 2001 to over 929 million subscribers as of May 2012. India primarily follows the GSM mobile system, in the 900?MHz band. Recent operators also operate in the 1800?MHz band. The dominant players are Airtel, Reliance Infocomm, Vodafone, Idea cellular and BSNL/MTNL. There are many smaller players, with operations in only a few states. International roaming agreements exist between most operators and many foreign carriers. The government allowed Mobile number portability (MNP) which enables mobile telephone users to retain their mobile telephone numbers when changing from one mobile network operator to another.[37]\\r\\nAs of 2016, India has deployed telecom operations in a total of 8 radio frequency bands.[38]\\r\\nIndia is divided into 22 telecom circles:\\r\\n^* Population statistics are available state-wise only. ^** North east circle includes Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, & Tripura ^*** West Bengal circle includes Andaman-Nicobar and Sikkim\\r\\nThe history of the Internet in India started with launch of services by VSNL on 15 August 1995.[41] They were able to add about 10,000 Internet users within 6 months.[42] However, for the next 10 years the Internet experience in the country remained less attractive with narrow-band connections having speeds less than 56 kbit/s (dial-up). In 2004, the government formulated its broadband policy which defined broadband as \\"an always-on Internet connection with download speed of 256 kbit/s or above.\\"[43] From 2005 onward the growth of the broadband sector in the country accelerated, but remained below the growth estimates of the government and related agencies due to resource issues in last-mile access which were predominantly wired-line technologies. This bottleneck was removed in 2010 when the government auctioned 3G spectrum followed by an equally high-profile auction of 4G spectrum that set the scene for a competitive and invigorated wireless broadband market. Now Internet access in India is provided by both public and private companies using a variety of technologies and media including dial-up (PSTN), xDSL, coaxial cable, Ethernet, FTTH, ISDN, HSDPA (3G), WiFi, WiMAX, etc. at a wide range of speeds and costs. As per IAMAI India will have the world's second largest number of Internet users with over 300 million by December 2014.[44]\\r\\nAccording to the Internet And Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), the Internet user base in the country stood at 190 million at the end of June, 2013.[45] As of October, 2013 report, it is over 205 million.[44] The number of broadband subscribers at the end of May 2013 was 15.19 million.[46] Cumulative Annual Growth rate (CAGR) of broadband during the five-year period between 2005 and 2010 was about 117 per cent.[43] DSL, while holding slightly more than 75% of the local broadband market, was steadily losing market share to other non-DSL broadband platforms, especially to wireless broadband.\\r\\nThere were 161 Internet Service Providers (ISPs) offering broadband services in India as of 31 May 2013. The top five ISPs in terms subscriber base were BSNL (9.96 million), Bharti Airtel (1.40 million), MTNL (1.09 million), Hathway (0.36 million) and You Broadband (0.31 million).[46] Cyber cafes remain the major source of Internet access. In 2009, about 37 per cent of the users access the Internet from cyber cafes, 30 per cent from an office, and 23 per cent from home. However, the number of mobile Internet users increased rapidly from 2009 on and there were about 274 million mobile users at the end of September 2010, with a majority using 2G mobile networks.[43] Mobile Internet subscriptions as reported by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in March 2011 increased to 381 million.\\r\\nOne of the major issues facing the Internet segment in India is the lower average bandwidth of broadband connections compared to that of developed countries. According to 2007 statistics, the average download speed in India hovered at about 40 KB per second (256 kbit/s), the minimum speed set by TRAI, whereas the international average was 5.6 Mbit/s during the same period. In order to attend this infrastructure issue the government declared 2007 as \\"the year of broadband\\".[47][48] To compete with international standards of defining broadband speed the Indian Government has taken the aggressive step of proposing a $13 billion national broadband network to connect all cities, towns and villages with a population of more than 500 in two phases targeted for completion by 2012 and 2013. The network was supposed to provide speeds up to 10 Mbit/s in 63 metropolitan areas and 4 Mbit/s in an additional 352 cities. Also, the Internet penetration rate in India is one of the lowest in the world and only accounts for 8.4% of the population compared to the rate in OECD counties, where the average is over 50%.[12][49][50] Another issue is the digital divide where growth is biased in favour of urban areas; according to 2010 statistics, more than 75 per cent of the broadband connections in the country are in the top 30 cities.[43] Regulators have tried to boost the growth of broadband in rural areas by promoting higher investment in rural infrastructure and establishing subsidised tariffs for rural subscribers under the Universal service obligation scheme of the Indian government.\\r\\nAs of May 2014, the Internet was delivered to India mainly by 9 different undersea fibres, including SEA-ME-WE 3, Bay of Bengal Gateway and Europe India Gateway, arriving at 5 different landing points.[51]\\r\\nAs of 2015[update], India had no laws governing net neutrality and there have been violations of net neutrality principles by some service providers. While the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) guidelines for the Unified Access Service license promote net neutrality, they are not enforced. The Information Technology Act, 2000 does not prohibit companies from throttling their service in accordance with their business interests.[52]\\r\\nIn March 2015, the TRAI released a formal consultation paper on Regulatory Framework for Over-the-top (OTT) services, seeking comments from the public. The consultation paper was criticised for being one sided and having confusing statements. It was condemned by various politicians and internet users.[53][54][55] By 18 April 2015, over 800,000 emails had been sent to TRAI demanding net neutrality.[55][56][57]\\r\\nTelevision broadcasting began in India in 1959 by Doordarshan, a state run medium of communication, and had slow expansion for more than two decades.[58] The policy reforms of the government in the 1990s attracted private initiatives in this sector, and since then, satellite television has increasingly shaped popular culture and Indian society. However, still, only the government owned Doordarshan has the licence for terrestrial television broadcast. Private companies reach the public using satellite channels; both cable television as well as DTH has obtained a wide subscriber base in India. In 2012, India had about 148 million TV homes of which 126 million has access to cable and satellite services.[59]\\r\\nFollowing the economic reforms in the 1990s, satellite television channels from around the worldBBC, CNN, CNBC, and other private television channels gained a foothold in the country.[14] There are no regulations to control the ownership of satellite dish antennas and also for operating cable television systems in India, which in turn has helped for an impressive growth in the viewership. The growth in the number of satellite channels was triggered by corporate business houses such as Star TV group and Zee TV. Initially restricted to music and entertainment channels, viewership grew, giving rise to several channels in regional languages, especially Hindi. The main news channels available were CNN and BBC World. In the late 1990s, many current affairs and news channels sprouted, becoming immensely popular because of the alternative viewpoint they offered compared to Doordarshan. Some of the notable ones are Aaj Tak (run by the India Today group) and STAR News, CNN-IBN, Times Now, initially run by the NDTV group and their lead anchor, Prannoy Roy (NDTV now has its own channels, NDTV 24x7, NDTV Profit and NDTV India). Over the years, Doordarshan services also have grown from a single national channel to six national and eleven regional channels. Nonetheless, it has lost the leadership in market, though it underwent many phases of modernisation in order to contain tough competition from private channels.[14]\\r\\nToday, television is the most penetrative media in India with industry estimates indicating that there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite connections, compared to other forms of mass media such as radio or internet.[60] Government of India has used the popularity of TV and radio among rural people for the implementation of many social-programmes including that of mass-education. On 16 November 2006, the Government of India released the community radio policy which allowed agricultural centres, educational institutions and civil society organisations to apply for community based FM broadcasting licence. Community Radio is allowed 100 watts of Effective Radiated Power (ERP) with a maximum tower height of 30 metres. The licence is valid for five years and one organisation can only get one licence, which is non-transferable and to be used for community development purposes.\\r\\nAs of March 2016, there are 345 radio stations in India.[6]\\r\\nHistorically, the role of telecommunication has evolved from that of plain information exchange to a multi-service field, with Value Added Services (VAS) integrated with various discrete networks like PSTN, PLMN, Internet Backbone etc. However, with decreasing ARPU and increasing demand for VAS has become a compelling reason for the service providers to think of the convergence of these parallel networks into a single core network with service layers separated from network layer.[61] Next-generation networking is such a convergence concept which according to ITU-T is:[62]\\r\\nA next-generation network (NGN) is a packet-based network which can provide services including Telecommunication Services and able to make use of multiple broadband, quality of Service-enabled transport technologies and in which service-related functions are independent from underlying transport-related technologies. It offers unrestricted access by users to different service providers. It supports generalised mobility which will allow consistent and ubiquitous provision of services to users.\\r\\nAccess network: The user can connect to the IP-core of NGN in various ways, most of which use the standard Internet Protocol (IP). User terminals such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computers can register directly on NGN-core, even when they are roaming in another network or country. The only requirement is that they can use IP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Fixed access (e.g., Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet), mobile access (e.g. W-CDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS) and wireless access (e.g.WLAN, WiMAX) are all supported. Other phone systems like plain old telephone service and non-compatible VoIP systems, are supported through gateways. With the deployment of the NGN, users may subscribe to many simultaneous access-providers providing telephony, internet or entertainment services. This may provide end-users with virtually unlimited options to choose between service providers for these services in NGN environment.[61]\\r\\nThe hyper-competition in telecom market, which was effectively caused by the introduction of Universal Access Service (UAS) licence in 2003 became much tougher after 3G and 4G competitive auction. About 670,000 route-kilometer (419,000-mile) of optical fibres has been laid in India by the major operators, including in the financially nonviable rural areas and the process continues.[citation needed] Keeping in mind the viability of providing services in rural areas, the government of India also took a proactive role to promote the NGN implementation in the country; an expert committee called NGN eCO was constituted in order to deliberate on the licensing, interconnection and Quality of Service (QoS) issues related to NGN and it submitted its report on 24 August 2007. Telecom operators found the NGN model advantageous, but huge investment requirements have prompted them to adopt a multi-phase migration and they have already started the migration process to NGN with the implementation of IP-based core-network.[61]\\r\\nLIRNEasia's Telecommunications Regulatory Environment (TRE) index, which summarises stakeholders' perception on certain TRE dimensions, provides insight into how conducive the environment is for further development and progress. The most recent survey was conducted in July 2008 in eight Asian countries, including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines. The tool measured seven dimensions: i) market entry; ii) access to scarce resources; iii) interconnection; iv) tariff regulation; v) anti-competitive practices; and vi) universal services; vii) quality of service, for the fixed, mobile and broadband sectors.\\r\\nThe results for India, point out to the fact that the stakeholders perceive the TRE to be most conducive for the mobile sector followed by fixed and then broadband. Other than for Access to ScarceResources the fixed sector lags behind the mobile sector. The fixed and mobile sectors have the highest scores for Tariff Regulation. Market entry also scores well for the mobile sector as competition is well entrenched with most of the circles with 4ÿ5 mobile service providers. The broadband sector has the lowest score in the aggregate. The low penetration of broadband of mere 3.87 against the policy objective of 9 million at the end of 2007 clearly indicates that the regulatory environment is not very conducive.[63]\\r\\nIn 2013 the home ministry stated that legislation must ensure that law enforcement agencies are empowered to intercept communications.[64]\\r\\nThe total revenue in the telecom service sector was ?867.2 billion (US$13.5?billion) in 2005ÿ06 as against ?716.74 billion (US$11.2?billion) in 2004ÿ2005, registering a growth of 21% with estimated revenue of FY'2011 of ?8.35 billion (US$130?million). The total investment in the telecom services sector reached ?2,006 billion (US$31.3?billion) in 2005ÿ06, up from ?1,788 billion (US$27.9?billion) in the previous fiscal.[65] Telecommunication is the lifeline of the rapidly growing Information Technology industry. Internet subscriber base has risen to more than a 121 million in 2011.[66] Out of this 11.47 million were broadband connections. More than a billion people use the Internet globally. Under the Bharat Nirman, the Government of India will ensure that 66,822 revenue villages in the country, which have not yet been provided with a Village Public Telephone (VPT), will be connected. However doubts have been raised about what it would mean for the poor in the country.[67]\\r\\nIt is difficult to ascertain fully the employment potential of the telecom sector but the enormity of the opportunities can be gauged from the fact that there were 3.7 million Public Call Offices in December 2005[68] up from 2.3 million in December 2004.\\r\\nThe Total Revenue of Indian Telecom Services company is likely to exceed ?2,000 billion (US$31?billion) ( US$44 Bn approx) for FY 11ÿ12 based on FY 10ÿ11 nos and latest quarterly results. These are consolidated numbers including foreign operation of Bharti Airtel. The major contributions to this revenue are as follows:[69]","input":"When did cell phones become popular in india?"},{"output":"in the afternoon","context":"English Renaissance theatrealso known as early modern English theatre and Elizabethan theatrerefers to the theatre of England between 1562 and 1642.\\r\\nThis is the style of the plays of William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term English Renaissance theatre encompasses the period between 1562following a performance of Gorboduc, the first English play using blank verse, at the Inner Temple during the Christmas season of 1561and the ban on theatrical plays enacted by the English Parliament in 1642.\\r\\nThe phrase Elizabethan theatre is sometimes used, improperly, to mean English Renaissance theatre, although in a strict sense \\"Elizabethan\\" only refers to the period of Queen Elizabeth's reign (1558ÿ1603). English Renaissance theatre may be said to encompass Elizabethan theatre from 1562 to 1603, Jacobean theatre from 1603 to 1625, and Caroline theatre from 1625 to 1642.\\r\\nAlong with the economics of the profession, the character of the drama changed towards the end of the period. Under Elizabeth, the drama was a unified expression as far as social class was concerned: the Court watched the same plays the commoners saw in the public playhouses. With the development of the private theatres, drama became more oriented towards the tastes and values of an upper-class audience. By the later part of the reign of Charles I, few new plays were being written for the public theatres, which sustained themselves on the accumulated works of the previous decades.[1]\\r\\nThe English grammar schools, like those on the continent, placed special emphasis on the trivium: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. Though rhetorical instruction was intended as preparation for careers in civil service such as law, the rhetorical canons of memory (memoria) and delivery (pronuntiatio), gesture and voice, as well as exercises from the progymnasmata, such as the prosopopoeia, taught theatrical skills.[2][3] Students would typically analyze Latin and Greek texts, write their own compositions, memorize them, and then perform them in front of their instructor and their peers.[4] Records show that in addition to this weekly performance, students would perform plays on holidays,[5] and in both Latin and English.[6]\\r\\nChoir schools connected with the Elizabethan court included St. Georges Chapel, the Chapel Royal, and St. Pauls.[7] These schools frequently performed plays and other court entertainments for the Queen.[8] Between the 1560s and 1570s these schools had begun to perform for general audiences as well.[9] Playing companies of boy actors were derived from choir schools.[10] An earlier example of a playwright contracted to write for the children's companies is John Lyly, who wrote Gallathea, Endymion, and Midas for Pauls Boys.[11] Another example is Ben Jonson, who wrote Cynthias Revels.[12]\\r\\nAcademic drama stems from late medieval and early modern practices of miracles and morality plays as well as the Feast of Fools and the election of a Lord of Misrule.[13] The Feast of Fools includes mummer plays.[14] The universities, particularly Oxford and Cambridge, were attended by students studying for bachelor's degrees and master's degrees, followed by doctorates in Law, Medicine, and Theology.[15] In the 1400s, dramas were often restricted to mummer plays with someone who read out all the parts in Latin.[16] With the rediscovery and redistribution of classical materials during the English Renaissance, Latin and Greek plays began to be restaged.[17] These plays were often accompanied by feasts.[18] Queen Elizabeth I viewed dramas during her visits to Oxford and Cambridge.[19] A well-known play cycle which was written and performed in the universities was the Parnassus Plays.[13]\\r\\nUpon graduation, many university students, especially those going into law, would reside and participate in the Inns of Court. The Inns of Court were communities of working lawyers and university alumni.[20] Notable literary figures and playwrights who resided in the Inns of Court include John Donne, Francis Beaumont, John Marston, Thomas Lodge, Thomas Campion, Abraham Fraunce, Sir Philip Sidney, Sir Thomas More, Sir Francis Bacon, and George Gascoigne.[21][22] Like the university, the Inns of Court elected their own Lord of Misrule.[23] Other activities included participation in moot court, disputation, and masques.[23][22] Plays written and performed in the Inns of Court include Gorboduc, Gismund of Salerne, and The Misfortunes of Arthur.[22] An example of a famous masque put on by the Inns was James Shirleys The Triumph of Peace. Shakespeares The Comedy of Errors and Twelfth Night were also performed here, although written for commercial theater.[24]\\r\\nThe first permanent English theatre, the Red Lion, opened in 1567[25] but it was a short-lived failure. The first successful theatres, such as The Theatre, opened in 1576.\\r\\nThe establishment of large and profitable public theatres was an essential enabling factor in the success of English Renaissance drama. Once they were in operation, drama could become a fixed and permanent, rather than transitory, phenomenon. Their construction was prompted when the Mayor and Corporation of London first banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the plague, and then formally expelled all players from the city in 1575.[26] This prompted the construction of permanent playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the liberties of Halliwell/Holywell in Shoreditch and later the Clink, and at Newington Butts near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields in rural Surrey.[26] The Theatre was constructed in Shoreditch in 1576 by James Burbage with his brother-in-law John Brayne (the owner of the unsuccessful Red Lion playhouse of 1567)[27] and the Newington Butts playhouse was set up, probably by Jerome Savage, some time between 1575[28] and 1577.[29] The Theatre was rapidly followed by the nearby Curtain Theatre (1577), the Rose (1587), the Swan (1595), the Globe (1599), the Fortune (1600), and the Red Bull (1604).[a]\\r\\nArchaeological excavations on the foundations of the Rose and the Globe in the late 20th century showed that all the London theatres had individual differences, but their common function necessitated a similar general plan.[30] The public theatres were three stories high, and built around an open space at the centre. Usually polygonal in plan to give an overall rounded effect, although the Red Bull and the first Fortune were square. The three levels of inward-facing galleries overlooked the open centre, into which jutted the stage: essentially a platform surrounded on three sides by the audience. The rear side was restricted for the entrances and exits of the actors and seating for the musicians. The upper level behind the stage could be used as a balcony, as in Romeo and Juliet and Antony and Cleopatra, or as a position from which an actor could harangue a crowd, as in Julius Caesar.[31]\\r\\nThe playhouses were generally built with timber and plaster. Individual theatre descriptions give additional information about their construction, such as flint stones being used to build the Swan. Theatres were also constructed to be able to hold a large number of people.[32]\\r\\nA different model was developed with the Blackfriars Theatre, which came into regular use on a long-term basis in 1599.[b] The Blackfriars was small in comparison to the earlier theatres and roofed rather than open to the sky. It resembled a modern theatre in ways that its predecessors did not. Other small enclosed theatres followed, notably the Whitefriars (1608) and the Cockpit (1617). With the building of the Salisbury Court Theatre in 1629 near the site of the defunct Whitefriars, the London audience had six theatres to choose from: three surviving large open-air public theatresthe Globe, the Fortune, and the Red Bulland three smaller enclosed private theatres: the Blackfriars, the Cockpit, and the Salisbury Court.[c] Audiences of the 1630s benefited from a half-century of vigorous dramaturgical development; the plays of Marlowe and Shakespeare and their contemporaries were still being performed on a regular basis, mostly at the public theatres, while the newest works of the newest playwrights were abundant as well, mainly at the private theatres.[citation needed]\\r\\nAround 1580, when both the Theatre and the Curtain were full on summer days, the total theatre capacity of London was about 5000 spectators. With the building of new theatre facilities and the formation of new companies, London's total theatre capacity exceeded 10,000 after 1610.[33]\\r\\nTicket prices in general varied during this time period. The cost of admission was based on where in the theatre a person wished to be situated, or based on what a person could afford. If people wanted a better view of the stage or to be more separate from the crowd, they would pay more for their entrance. Due to inflation that occurred during this time period, admission increased in some theatres from a penny to a sixpence or even higher.[34]\\r\\nCommercial theaters were largely located just outside the boundaries of the City of London, since City authorities tended to be wary of the adult playing companies, but plays were performed by touring companies all over England.[35] English companies even toured and performed English plays abroad, especially in Germany and in Denmark.[36][d]\\r\\nThe acting companies functioned on a repertory system: unlike modern productions that can run for months or years on end, the troupes of this era rarely acted the same play two days in a row. Thomas Middleton's A Game at Chess ran for nine straight performances in August 1624 before it was closed by the authorities; but this was due to the political content of the play and was a unique, unprecedented, and unrepeatable phenomenon. The 1592 season of Lord Strange's Men at the Rose Theatre was far more representative: between 19 February and 23 June the company played six days a week, minus Good Friday and two other days. They performed 23 different plays, some only once, and their most popular play of the season, The First Part of Hieronimo, based on Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy, 15 times. They never played the same play two days in a row, and rarely the same play twice in a week.[38][e] The workload on the actors, especially the leading performers like Richard Burbage or Edward Alleyn, must have been tremendous.\\r\\nOne distinctive feature of the companies was that they included only males. Female parts were played by adolescent boy players in women's costume. Some companies were composed entirely of boy players.[f] Performances in the public theatres (like the Globe) took place in the afternoon with no artificial lighting, but when, in the course of a play, the light began to fade, candles were lit.[41] In the enclosed private theatres (like the Blackfriars) artificial lighting was used throughout. Plays contained little to no scenery as the scenery was described by the actors or indicated by costume through the course of the play.[42]\\r\\nIn the Elizabethan era, research has been conclusive about how many actors and troupes there were in the 16th century, but little research delves into the roles of the actors on the English renaissance stage. The first point is that during the Elizabethan era, women were not allowed to act on stage. The actors were all male; in fact, most were boys. For plays written that had male and female parts, the female parts were played by the youngest boy players.[43]\\r\\nIn Elizabethan entertainment, troupes were created and they were considered the actor companies. They traveled around England as drama was the most entertaining art at the time. As a boy player, many skills had to be implemented such as voice and athleticism (fencing was one).[43] Stronger female roles in tragedies were acted by older boy players because they had the experience.[43]\\r\\nElizabethan actors never played the same show on successive days and added a new play to their repertoire every other week. These actors were getting paid within these troupes so for their job, they would constantly learn new plays as they toured different cities in England. In these plays, there were bookkeepers that acted as the narrators of these plays and they would introduce the actors and the different roles they played. At some points, the bookkeeper wouldnt state the narrative of the scene, so the audience could find out for themselves. In Elizabethan and Jacobean plays, the plays often exceeded the number of characters/roles and didnt have enough actors to fulfill them, thus the idea of doubling roles came to be.[44] Doubling roles is used to reinforce a plays theme by having the actor act out the different roles simultaneously.[45] The reason for this was for the acting companies to control salary costs, or to be able to perform under conditions where resources such as other actor companies lending actors were not present.[45]\\r\\nThere are two acting styles implemented. Formal and natural. Formal acting is objective and traditional, natural acting attempts to create an illusion for the audience by remaining in character and imitating the fictional circumstances. The formal actor symbolizes while the natural actor interprets. The natural actor impersonates while the formal actor represents the role. Natural and formal are opposites of each other, where natural acting is subjective. Overall, the use of these acting styles and the doubled roles dramatic device made Elizabethan plays very popular.[46]\\r\\nOne of the main uses of costume during the Elizabethan era was to make up for the lack of scenery, set, and props on stage. It created a visual effect for the audience, and it was an integral part of the overall performance.[47] Since the main visual appeal on stage were the costumes, they were often bright in colour and visually entrancing. Colours symbolized social hierarchy, and costumes were made to reflect that. For example, if a character was royalty, their costume would include purple. The colours, as well as the different fabrics of the costumes, allowed the audience to know the status of each character when they first appeared on stage.[48]\\r\\nCostumes were collected in inventory. More often than not, costumes wouldn't be made individually to fit the actor. Instead, they would be selected out of the stock that theatre companies would keep. A theatre company reused costumes when possible and would rarely get new costumes made. Costumes themselves were expensive, so usually players wore contemporary clothing regardless of the time period of the play. The most expensive pieces were given to higher class characters because costuming was used to identify social status on stage. The fabrics within a playhouse would indicate the wealth of the company itself. The fabrics used the most were: velvet, satin, silk, cloth-of-gold, lace, and ermine.[49] For less significant characters; actors would use their own clothes.\\r\\nActors also left clothes in their will for following actors to use. Masters would also leave clothes for servants in their will, but servants werent allowed to wear fancy clothing, instead, they sold the clothes back to theatre companies.[48] In the Elizabethan era, there was a law stating that certain classes could only wear clothing fitting of their status in society. There was a discrimination of status within the classes. Higher classes flaunted their wealth and power through the appearance of clothing, however, actors were the only exception. If actors belonged to a licensed acting company, they were allowed to dress above their standing in society for specific roles in a production.[50]\\r\\nThe growing population of London, the growing wealth of its people, and their fondness for spectacle produced a dramatic literature of remarkable variety, quality, and extent. Although most of the plays written for the Elizabethan stage have been lost, over 600 remain.\\r\\nThe people who wrote these plays were primarily self-made men from modest backgrounds.[g] Some of them were educated at either Oxford or Cambridge, but many were not. Although William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson were actors, the majority do not seem to have been performers, and no major author who came on to the scene after 1600 is known to have supplemented his income by acting. Their lives were subject to the same levels of danger and earlier mortality as all who lived during the early modern period: Christopher Marlowe was killed in an apparent tavern brawl, while Ben Jonson killed an actor in a duel. Several were probably soldiers.\\r\\nPlaywrights were normally paid in increments during the writing process, and if their play was accepted, they would also receive the proceeds from one day's performance. However, they had no ownership of the plays they wrote. Once a play was sold to a company, the company owned it, and the playwright had no control over casting, performance, revision, or publication.\\r\\nThe profession of dramatist was challenging and far from lucrative.[52] Entries in Philip Henslowe's Diary show that in the years around 1600 Henslowe paid as little as S6 or S7 per play. This was probably at the low end of the range, though even the best writers could not demand too much more. A playwright, working alone, could generally produce two plays a year at most. In the 1630s Richard Brome signed a contract with the Salisbury Court Theatre to supply three plays a year, but found himself unable to meet the workload. Shakespeare produced fewer than 40 solo plays in a career that spanned more than two decades: he was financially successful because he was an actor and, most importantly, a shareholder in the company for which he acted and in the theatres they used. Ben Jonson achieved success as a purveyor of Court masques, and was talented at playing the patronage game that was an important part of the social and economic life of the era. Those who were purely playwrights fared far less well: the biographies of early figures like George Peele and Robert Greene, and later ones like Brome and Philip Massinger, are marked by financial uncertainty, struggle, and poverty.\\r\\nPlaywrights dealt with the natural limitation on their productivity by combining into teams of two, three, four, and even five to generate play texts. The majority of plays written in this era were collaborations, and the solo artists who generally eschewed collaborative efforts, like Jonson and Shakespeare, were the exceptions to the rule. Dividing the work, of course, meant dividing the income; but the arrangement seems to have functioned well enough to have made it worthwhile. Of the 70-plus known works in the canon of Thomas Dekker, roughly 50 are collaborations. In a single year (1598) Dekker worked on 16 collaborations for impresario Philip Henslowe, and earned S30, or a little under 12 shillings per weekroughly twice as much as the average artisan's income of 1s. per day.[53] At the end of his career, Thomas Heywood would famously claim to have had \\"an entire hand, or at least a main finger\\" in the authorship of some 220 plays. A solo artist usually needed months to write a play (though Jonson is said to have done Volpone in five weeks); Henslowe's Diary indicates that a team of four or five writers could produce a play in as little as two weeks. Admittedly, though, the Diary also shows that teams of Henslowe's house dramatistsAnthony Munday, Robert Wilson, Richard Hathwaye, Henry Chettle, and the others, even including a young John Webstercould start a project, and accept advances on it, yet fail to produce anything stageworthy.[54]\\r\\nEnglish Renaissance Playwrights Timeline\\r\\nShort yellow lines indicate 27 years  the average age these authors began their playwrighting careers.\\r\\nGenres of the period included the history play, which depicted English or European history. Shakespeare's plays about the lives of kings, such as Richard III and Henry V, belong to this category, as do Christopher Marlowe's Edward II and George Peele's Famous Chronicle of King Edward the First. History plays dealt with more recent events, like A Larum for London which dramatizes the sack of Antwerp in 1576.\\r\\nTragedy was a very popular genre. Marlowe's tragedies were exceptionally successful, such as Dr. Faustus and The Jew of Malta. The audiences particularly liked revenge dramas, such as Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy. The four tragedies considered to be Shakespeare's greatest (Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth) were composed during this period.\\r\\nComedies were common, too. A subgenre developed in this period was the city comedy, which deals satirically with life in London after the fashion of Roman New Comedy. Examples are Thomas Dekker's The Shoemaker's Holiday and Thomas Middleton's A Chaste Maid in Cheapside.\\r\\nThough marginalised, the older genres like pastoral (The Faithful Shepherdess, 1608), and even the morality play (Four Plays in One, ca. 1608-13) could exert influences. After about 1610, the new hybrid subgenre of the tragicomedy enjoyed an efflorescence, as did the masque throughout the reigns of the first two Stuart kings, James I and Charles I.\\r\\nOnly a minority of the plays of English Renaissance theatre were ever printed. Of Heywood's 220 plays, only about 20 were published in book form.[55] A little over 600 plays were published in the period as a whole, most commonly in individual quarto editions. (Larger collected editions, like those of Shakespeare's, Ben Jonson's, and Beaumont and Fletcher's plays, were a late and limited development.) Through much of the modern era, it was thought that play texts were popular items among Renaissance readers that provided healthy profits for the stationers who printed and sold them. By the turn of the 21st century, the climate of scholarly opinion shifted somewhat on this belief: some contemporary researchers argue that publishing plays was a risky and marginal business[56]though this conclusion has been disputed by others.[57] Some of the most successful publishers of the English Renaissance, like William Ponsonby or Edward Blount, rarely published plays.\\r\\nA small number of plays from the era survived not in printed texts but in manuscript form.[h]\\r\\nThe rising Puritan movement was hostile toward theatre, as they felt that \\"entertainment\\" was sinful. Politically, playwrights and actors were clients of the monarchy and aristocracy, and most supported the Royalist cause. The Puritan faction, long powerful in London, gained control of the city early in the First English Civil War, and on 2 September 1642, the Long Parliament, pushed by the Parliamentarian party, under Puritan influence, banned the staging of plays in the London theatres though it did not, contrary to what is commonly stated, order the closure, let alone the destruction, of the theatres themselves:\\r\\nWhereas the distressed Estate of Ireland, steeped in her own Blood, and the distracted Estate of England, threatened with a Cloud of Blood by a Civil War, call for all possible Means to appease and avert the Wrath of God, appearing in these Judgements; among which, Fasting and Prayer, having been often tried to be very effectual, having been lately and are still enjoined; and whereas Public Sports do not well agree with Public Calamities, nor Public Stage-plays with the Seasons of Humiliation, this being an Exercise of sad and pious Solemnity, and the other being Spectacles of Pleasure, too commonly expressing lascivious Mirth and Levity: It is therefore thought fit, and Ordained, by the Lords and Commons in this Parliament assembled, That, while these sad causes and set Times of Humiliation do continue, Public Stage Plays shall cease, and be forborn, instead of which are recommended to the People of this Land the profitable and seasonable considerations of Repentance, Reconciliation, and Peace with God, which probably may produce outward Peace and Prosperity, and bring again Times of Joy and Gladness to these Nations.\\r\\nThe Act purports the ban to be temporary (\\"...while these sad causes and set Times of Humiliation do continue, Public Stage Plays shall cease and be forborn\\") but does not assign a time limit to it.\\r\\nEven after 1642, during the English Civil War and the ensuing Interregnum (English Commonwealth, some English Renaissance theatre continued. For example, short comical plays called Drolls were allowed by the authorities, while full-length plays were banned. The theatre buildings were not closed but rather were used for purposes other than staging plays.[i]\\r\\nThe performance of plays remained banned for most of the next eighteen years, becoming allowed again after the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. The theatres began performing many of the plays of the previous era, though often in adapted forms. New genres of Restoration comedy and spectacle soon evolved, giving English theatre of the later seventeenth century its distinctive character.\\r\\nEnglish Renaissance playing company timeline\\r\\nThis timeline charts the existence of major English playing companies from 1572 (\\"Acte for the punishment of Vacabondes\\", which legally restricted acting to players with a patron of sufficient degree) to 1642 (the closing of the theatres by Parliament). A variety of strolling players, and even early London-based troupes existed before 1572. The situations were often fluid, and much of this history is obscure; this timeline necessarily implies more precision than exists in some cases.

In The Vampire Diaries, set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, she is portrayed by Nina Dobrev. In the books, Elena was blonde, popular, selfish and a \\"mean girl\\". However the show's producers, Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson, felt that it wasn't the direction they wanted to go with their heroine in The Vampire Diaries television series. Instead, she became a nicer, relatable and more of \\"the girl next door\\" type, until her life gets flipped upside down when she meets the Salvatores. In April 2015, Nina Dobrev announced that she would be departing the series after the sixth season finale.\\r\\nMuch of Elena's story revolves around her relationships with vampires Stefan Salvatore and his older brother, Damon. It is revealed that Elena is a Petrova Doppelg?nger, which is thus responsible for her being identical to her ancestor, Katherine Pierce (ne Katerina Petrova). This also has the implication of making her a supernatural creature. Dobrev portrayed the \\"conniving\\" Katherine as well, who is opposite of Elena. The actress stated that it has been a challenge distinguishing the two, and enjoys playing them both. In the television series's fourth season, Elena becomes a vampire and deals with the struggles that come with her change. She took the cure and became human again towards the end of the sixth season. In the finale of the sixth season, Kai linked Elena to Bonnie's life by magic. Elena will only wake up when Bonnie dies in around 60 years. She was locked inside the Salvatore tomb, which was changed in the seventh season, and was relocated in Brooklyn, New York. In late 2016, when it was announced that the eighth season would be the final season, Dobrev was in talks about returning to the television series to reprise her role in the final episode. After much speculation. Dobrev's return was confirmed on January 26, 2017, via an Instagram post. Dobrev appeared in the final episode of the show as both Elena and her evil doppelg?nger Katherine Pierce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 9, 2009, it was announced that Bulgarian-born Canadian actress Nina Dobrev, known for her portrayal of Mia Jones on Degrassi: The Next Generation, had joined the cast of The Vampire Diaries as Elena.[2] She was the second cast member to be announced following Steven R. McQueen, who plays Elena's brother Jeremy Gilbert.[3] Steve West Cinema Blend said the vampire brothers' battle over Elena will wreak havoc on the entire town.\\".[2] Executive producer Kevin Williamson recalled Dobrev auditioning while having the flu, which he described as the \\"best audition ever\\", and they \\"didn't even look at her a second time\\". Dobrev went back home to Canada, yet, still wanting the part, she submitted a videotape audition, which saw her cast as Elena Gilbert.[4]\\r\\nDobrev said that after reading the script, she was drawn to Elena because she was \\"this average girl who was damaged in many ways\\".[5] Initially, she believed that she would be playing the \\"bad girl\\" Elena from the books, but the show wanted to go in a different direction for the character.[4] After researching, Dobrev discovered she would also play Elena's 534-year-old vampire doppelg?nger Katherine Pierce whose characteristics are the \\"complete opposite\\".[5] Dobrev described this as \\"one of the rarest, coolest opportunities in television, to play two people on the same medium\\". She had confessed that she enjoys playing Katherine more than Elena.[5] Dobrev stated that she changes her appearance to distinguish Elena from her doppelg?nger, Katherine; \\"Changing my hair helps me transform,\\" she told Glamour.[6] Additionally, she said \\"I think I have one of the coolest characters on the show  I get to play two completely different people on opposite sides of the spectrum and I just have so much fun doing it\\".[4] Dobrev felt that her biggest challenge on The Vampire Diaries was distinguishing Katherine and Elena, and found it \\"interesting\\" to create a whole new character.[1] In the novels, Katherine originated from Germany. However, in the television series, she is Bulgarian, as is Dobrev, who can speak the language fluently . Dobrev said, \\"The writers heard me speaking Bulgarian to my mom on the phone while I was on set one day. One thing led to the other and voila\\".[7]\\r\\nIn the books, Elena is considered \\"one of the popular girls\\" at her high school and always gets \\"anything she wants\\".[8] Executive producer of the television show, Julie Plec, said the Elena from the books was \\"really kind of selfish\\". In The Vampire Diaries, Elena's \\"selfishness\\" in the books as a human was never explored, because it \\"didn't ever feel like a characteristic\\" the show wanted for their heroine.[9] Plec said \\"We kind of abandoned that queen-bee popular complex that in a lot of ways defined early Elena in the books\\", while feeling that Elena's actual flaw is her \\"deep, deep connection to other people\\".[9] In the books, Elena had blonde hair, but has brown hair in the television show.[10] Describing Elena from the books, Dobrev said she is \\"one of those mean girls that gets what she wants, popular . . . and she's blonde and blue eyed\\". Williamson told her that \\"the angle we wanted to go for was the relatable, nice, girl next door, who the audience roots for\\".[4] Katherine, on the other hand, is penned as a \\"conniving, narcissistic, bitch\\".[4] Describing Elena years later, Dobrev said she evolved from a \\"younger, naive, sad, young girl\\" to a \\"strong woman\\".[1]\\r\\nBefore The Vampire Diaries, Elena dated Matt Donovan (Zach Roerig), who was unable to move past his feelings for her initially after their break-up.[11] Elena began dating Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley), and later discovered he was a vampire.[12] As the episodes progressed, she developed a connection with Stefan's adventurous brother Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder), who consumes human blood, unlike Stefan, who has an animal blood diet.[13] Speaking about the different qualities Stefan and Damon bring to Elena, Dobrev said they have \\"different qualities that are very appealing\\", which combined make \\"the perfect man\\". She said \\"Stefan is committed and sweet and protective and loving, and Damon is spontaneous and crazy and fun and exciting\\".[5]\\r\\nAfter Elena became a vampire, she became sired to Damon and they slept together. According to Plec during an interview with TVLine, Elena \\"really believes what she feels is 100 percent genuine and real\\", and the couple \\"wants to be together and realizes that they shouldnt, yet really wants to. So what do they do?\\"[14] Stefan became heartbroken, feeling angry and betrayed, and lashed out at Damon and Elena.[15] In the season 4 finale, an unsired Elena confirms that she is in love with Damon, and the two kiss passionately. At the end of season 6, the two plan to become human, get married, and have children together, but their dream is abruptly compromised by Kai, who puts Elena into a magical coma. Damon remains entirely devoted to Elena throughout the remaining two seasons as Elena sleeps peacefully. In the season 8 finale, she is revealed to be happily married to Damon. Elena considers Damon to be the love of her life and her soulmate.\\r\\nExecutive producers Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson agreed that in the book series, Elena was turned into a vampire too early, which was around page 200 of The Awakening.[16] Elena's transition into a vampire was planned for two years. Plec said: \\"That felt obviously too soon, and rushed, and we didnt want to make a show about a teenage girl who instantly becomes a vampire. But we always knew that her journey would take her there eventually\\".[16] At the second season's conclusion, Elena was nearly turned into a vampire.[1] Dobrev was happy that she wasn't, because she felt \\"it would have been too soon\\", and also didn't think it was something Elena or she wanted.[1]\\r\\nIn the show's third season, Elena has a brain hemorrhage which was initially thought to be a concussion, and begins to die.[17] In what was described by the International Business Times as \\"the moment Vampire Diaries fans have been waiting for\\", Elena had to choose whether to be driven to Damon or Stefan to say goodbye to. At the time, Klaus was killed, meaning all vampires sprouting from his bloodline also die, which includes Damon and Stefan. She picks to say goodbye to Stefan.[17] However, all these vampires end up surviving when Klaus never really dies. To save her, Doctor Merideth Fell (Torrey DeVitto) fed Elena Damon's blood. Rebekah Mikaelson kills Elena on Wickery Bridge, unaware of the vampire blood in her system. She woke up as a vampire at the end of the season.[17] The Hollywood Reporter interviewed Plec, and described her transition as \\"monumental changes\\" which would have Elena in for a \\"wild ride\\". Plec said Elena becoming a vampire is \\"an awakening of a person who is about to go through a lot of changes\\", and \\"she is going to evolve as a person and her relationships are going to evolve accordingly\\".[18] While Stefan was afraid she would hurt someone, Damon thought it was inevitable and wanted to \\"rip the band-aid off\\".[18] Plec felt that \\"Shes, unfortunately, not getting the same advice from the two people she values most in the world. Its going to make it more difficult for her\\",[18] while describing the situation as \\"a whole new Elena and its a whole new day. Its a different dynamic between the three of them especially\\".[18]\\r\\nElena Gilbert is born on June 22, 1992 in Mystic Falls, Virginia to John Gilbert (David Anders) and Isobel Flemming (Mia Kirshner) while they were still in highschool. With the help of John's brother Grayson, Isobel and John flee town days later, leaving Grayson and his wife Miranda to adopt Elena as their own. A doctor, Grayson fakes a birth certificate so that it appeared Elena was his daughter with Miranda. The next year, Miranda and Grayson had a child of their own, Jeremy Gilbert. Elena dates her childhood friend Matt Donovan, who was her first love. On 23 May 2009, Elena is picked up by her mother and father after getting in a fight with Matt while attending the party. The three of them later end up in a car accident, with their car driving off a bridge. Stefan Salvatore finds them, and saves Elena, but it was too late to save Grayson and Miranda, who died. It remained unknown for months who saved Elena, and it was considered a miracle that she lived. Her relationship with Matt ended when they broke up.\\r\\nElena, still empty after losing her parents, begins to fit back into school. She meets a mysterious new student named Stefan Salvatore. They connect instantly, and begin dating. She meets his older and malevolent brother, Damon. After researching, Elena realizes Stefan was alive in 1953. It is later revealed that he is a 162-year-old vampire. Damon also begins falling for Elena. After she and Stefan slept together, Elena finds a picture of a woman named Katherine Pierce who looks exactly like her. Stefan reveals that it is the woman who made him and Damon feud 145 years ago, and the person who turned them into vampires. He also told her that he is the person that saved her the night of her parents death. At the end of season one, Elena discovers that Grayson and Miranda weren't her biological parents, and that a woman named Isobel and her uncle John, who she grew up hating, were.\\r\\nIn season two, she learns that she is a Petrova doppelg?nger, having an appearance just like Katherine Pierce, which means that she has to be sacrificed to release Klaus' werewolf side. The sacrifice later happens, but Elena is saved, because John sacrificed himself for her after being put under a spell by Bonnie. However, her aunt Jenna is turned into a vampire and, as part of the sacrifice, is killed by Klaus, leaving Elena without a guardian. In the season two finale, while Damon is dying due to a werewolf bite, she forgives him for forcing her to drink his blood and kisses him with the thought that it might be Damon's last day, however Damon gets cured by drinking Klaus' blood.\\r\\nIn season three, Elena does everything in her power to make Stefan get his humanity back, which was turned off by Klaus as payment for saving Damon from a werewolf bite in the latter part of season two. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Damon while working together on saving Stefan and trying to defeat Klaus, eventually even sharing a kiss. She later admits to Stefan that she has feelings for Damon as well but that she never stopped loving Stefan. While in Denver together, Elena kisses Damon, later telling him that she doesn't know how she feels about him. It is eventually revealed that Elena met Damon the night of her parent's death, though he compelled her to forget. She eventually chooses Stefan in the season finale but before she can tell him, Elena drowns while having vampire blood in her system. During the last moments of season three, she awakens as a vampire in transition.\\r\\nIn season four, Elena is faced with the tough decision of whether to die or to feed on human blood so she can fully transition into a vampire. Elena, after realizing Stefan's desperation to keep her alive, decides to complete her transition. Her relationship with Stefan ends, allowing her to begin a proper romance with Damon. Although, it is later revealed there is a sire bond between them. Sometime later whilst searching for the cure for vampirism, Jeremy is fed to the immortal Silas by Katherine. As a result, Damon used the sire bond to convince her to turn off her humanity, due to her incredible grief over losing her brother and the last remaining member of her family. Elena became ruthless without her emotions, going on killing sprees and being very hateful towards her friends. Towards the end of season four, Damon kills Matt in front of Elena to trigger her grief. After revealing that Matt had the Gilbert Ring on, Elena's humanity was switched on and her emotions were focused on hate towards Katherine for killing Jeremy. Season four ended with Bonnie as a ghost after bringing Jeremy back to life and Elena fed Katherine the cure for vampirism in a moment of desperation as she was about to be killed. Elena had chosen Damon as the Salvatore that she loved.\\r\\nIn season five, Elena starts at Whitmore College and is happy after spending the summer with Damon. There she realises that Silas has taken Stefan's place and that Stefan is in that safe in a river constantly drowning. She and Damon then find the safe, only to find a dead body there meaning that someone opened the safe and Stefan is a Ripper again. However, Qyetsiyah had fried Stefan's brain causing him to suffer amnesia. While trying to bring him back, they almost kiss meaning that she still feels something for him. Qyetsiyah soon brings back Stefan's memories and says that Elena and Stefan were always meant to be as the Universe had to unite the doppelg?ngers of Silas and Amara. This leaves Damon and Elena questioning their relationship. Later on she is kidnapped and experimented on by Wes Maxfield, and she learns that her father also used to experiment on vampires. Later, when Katherine is about to die as a result of all of her years catching up with her as a result of having the cure in her system, Katherine uses a spell and possesses Elena, a fact that her friends were initially unable to deduce. But once they did, they trapped Katherine and left her with no escape. Stefan stabbed her with the traveller dagger, but ghost Katherine reveals to Bonnie, shortly before trying to cross into the Other Side, that she had injected Dr. Maxfield's enhanced ripper/werewolf virus into Elena's body, infecting Elena. The gang is eventually able to find an antidote. She unfortunately loses trust in Damon, partly because he killed her friend Aaron, so they break up, but realise they cannot survive being apart and get back together. Once Markos and his traveller army begin to take over Mystic Falls, setting an anti-magic barrier around the town, the gang comes up with a plan to take out the travellers by killing them all at the same time, overpowering the anchor to the Other Side AKA Bonnie and creating a possible way out of the now-collapsing Other Side. Elena and Damon drive into the gas-filled Mystic Grill with most of the travellers in it, blowing it up and killing most of the people in it, including Elena and Damon. She wakes up as a ghost and finds her body, sending her to Bonnie, where she passes to the Other Side, and she and many others are able to pass back to the land of the living afterwards. But the spell that allows this is broken before Damon passes back through, and as Bonnie is the anchor, she is a part of the Other Side and shall therefore disappear along with it. This leaves the gang mourning the loss of Damon and Bonnie in the season finale.\\r\\nIn season six, Elena starts back at Whitmore, and is unable to set foot in her hometown. She is also unable to recover from Damon's death and starts lurking the borders of Mystic Falls in order to grab civilians, drink their blood, then compel them to forget, but as spirit magic no longer works in Mystic Falls, any of her victims who cross into the town remember the ordeal, putting her identity as a vampire at risk when one of her victims, Sarah, comes to town. Elena begs Alaric to compel her to forget that she ever loved Damon, which Alaric is able to do, due to him being an Enhanced Original, with the ability to compel other vampires. She eventually wears him down and asks her friends to never remind her once the compulsion had been done. After a number of failed attempts, Alaric successfully compels her to forget her love for Damon. She however leaves Alaric with some of her reminders of Damon, should she ever need them again. She is told of her former feelings for Damon soon afterwards, but decides to stay the way she is, as she doesn't want to go back to being unhappy again. She starts to date her classmate, Liam. Once Damon comes back to life, Alaric tries to convince Elena to allow him to undo the compulsion, a decision she is reluctant to make. She eventually decides to have him undo it, but Alaric goes back to being human again after crossing into Mystic Falls, causing him to lose his vampire status (he only stayed alive because his once fatal human injuries were healed), meaning he will not be able to do so. She is then left to finally come face-to-face with Damon and see if she'll still feel the same way about him. They eventually rekindle their relationship,Elena takes the cure that Bonnie gave Damon. At Alaric's wedding Kai ruins their wedding and casts a sleeping spell on Elena, linking her life to Bonnie's. She makes a sacrifice to let Bonnie live out her life until it is her turn. She bids goodbye to her friends and loved ones before parting ways but knows that she will see Damon, Stefan and Caroline again one day.\\r\\nElena doesn't make an appearance but is heard calling Damon's name when he visits the Armory vault. It was a way of Sybill, the Siren, luring him into a trap.\\r\\nIn the final episode, Elena makes an appearance. When a weakened Bonnie dies from the sounding bell, she meets Elena in a dream-like forest. Elena hugs her and wonders if she really has died. Enzo appears and says it isn't her time and takes Bonnie back to the world of the living. When Bonnie wakes up, it was Stefan who resuscitated her. Elena, asleep, is then taken to the Mystic Falls High School by Katherine and places her in the boiler room. Stefan tries to rescue Elena, but Katherine had Kai spell the boiler room, so that Elena can't be taken out of the room. After Bonnie had deflected the hellfire back into the bell, Bonnie passes out. Elena wakes up and wanders the school. Stefan meets up with her. It looks like Bonnie has died, but in fact Elena is still sleeping and Stefan's ghost came to visit her in her dream. He had taken the place of killing Katherine instead of Damon, since Damon is human after Stefan gave him the cure. He came to say goodbye. After a tearful hug and saying goodbye, Stefan goes into afterlife. Elena finally wakes up because Bonnie has broken the spell over her. Elena reunites with Damon and the rest of the gang. Elena gives Caroline the message Stefan whispered into her ear, saying he did hear her voice message and will love her forever. In the epilogue, Elena continued to studying medical school. After finishing her education, she went back to Mystic Falls and lived together with Damon, happily married for a long time. After living out her life, she crosses over to the afterlife where she finally reunites with her parents, Aunt Jenna and Uncle John.\\r\\nElena has received mainly positive reviews. Steve West of the Cinema Blend compared the story of The Vampire Diaries and the character of Elena to the popular vampire franchise, Twilight, and its protagonist Bella Swan. West said \\"Clearly Elena is way hotter than Bella, she has two immortal vampires fighting over her\\".[2] After she transitioned into a vampire, Carina Adly MacKenzie of Zap2it hoped that the \\"fierce\\" and \\"ripper\\" side of Elena would emerge when \\"someone messes with the people she loves\\".[19] McKenzie noted that when a person becomes a vampire, \\"their strongest personality traits are heightened\\", and hoped that wouldn't see Elena's \\"compassion and selflessness\\" double into \\"helping old ladies with their groceries and nursing injured animals back to health\\".[19] Robyn Ross of TV Guide also hoped that after Elena \\"has had a taste for blood\\", she would lose control. Prior to her becoming a vampire, Ross thought she was less fun and \\"slightly boring\\", and wanted Elena to follow her instinct and \\"stop protecting everyone's feelings\\".[20]\\r\\nElena's romances with Stefan and Damon have become a popular craze with viewers, who have nicknamed them \\"Stelena\\" and \\"Delena\\".[21] Andy Swift of the website HollywoodLife praised Elena's relationship with Damon, which was a combination of real love and a sired bond, hoping they would live \\"happily ever after\\".[21] Vlada Gelman of TVLine, however, felt that their romance was \\"over in a rather mature way for a young love triangle\\" and questioned whether Elena was \\"ready to jump into a relationship with Damon right away\\" while Stefan was still in the picture.[22]\\r\\nTonner Doll Company, Inc. created dolls for Elena and Katherine along with Stefan and Damon, from 1864.[23][24]","input":"When is elena going to be a vampire?"},{"output":"X-ray telescopes","context":"The Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), previously known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), is a Flagship-class space observatory launched on STS-93 by NASA on July 23, 1999. Chandra is sensitive to X-ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope, enabled by the high angular resolution of its mirrors. Since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays, they are not detectable from Earth-based telescopes; therefore space-based telescopes are required to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth satellite in a 64-hour orbit, and its mission is ongoing as of 2017[update].\\r\\nChandra is one of the Great Observatories, along with the Hubble Space Telescope, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991ÿ2000), and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The telescope is named after the Nobel Prize-winning Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.[6] Its mission is similar to that of ESA's XMM-Newton spacecraft, also launched in 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976 the Chandra X-ray Observatory (called AXAF at the time) was proposed to NASA by Riccardo Giacconi and Harvey Tananbaum. Preliminary work began the following year at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). In the meantime, in 1978, NASA launched the first imaging X-ray telescope, Einstein (HEAO-2), into orbit. Work continued on the AXAF project throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1992, to reduce costs, the spacecraft was redesigned. Four of the twelve planned mirrors were eliminated, as were two of the six scientific instruments. AXAF's planned orbit was changed to an elliptical one, reaching one third of the way to the Moon's at its farthest point. This eliminated the possibility of improvement or repair by the space shuttle but put the observatory above the Earth's radiation belts for most of its orbit. AXAF was assembled and tested by TRW (now Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems) in Redondo Beach, California.\\r\\nAXAF was renamed Chandra as part of a contest held by NASA in 1998, which drew more than 6,000 submissions worldwide.[7] The contest winners, Jatila van der Veen and Tyrel Johnson (then a high school teacher and high school student, respectively), suggested the name in honor of Nobel Prizeÿwinning Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is known for his work in determining the maximum mass of white dwarf stars, leading to greater understanding of high energy astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars and black holes.[6] Fittingly, the name Chandra means \\"moon\\" in Sanskrit.[8]\\r\\nOriginally scheduled to be launched in December 1998,[7] the spacecraft was delayed several months, eventually being launched in July 1999 by Space Shuttle Columbia during STS-93. At 22,753 kilograms (50,162?lb), it was the heaviest payload ever launched by the shuttle, a consequence of the two-stage Inertial Upper Stage booster rocket system needed to transport the spacecraft to its high orbit.\\r\\nChandra has been returning data since the month after it launched. It is operated by the SAO at the Chandra X-ray Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with assistance from MIT and Northrop Grumman Space Technology. The ACIS CCDs suffered particle damage during early radiation belt passages. To prevent further damage, the instrument is now removed from the telescope's focal plane during passages.\\r\\nAlthough Chandra was initially given an expected lifetime of 5 years, on September 4, 2001 NASA extended its lifetime to 10 years \\"based on the observatory's outstanding results.\\"[9] Physically Chandra could last much longer. A 2004 study performed at the Chandra X-ray Center indicated that the observatory could last at least 15 years.[10]\\r\\nIn July 2008, the International X-ray Observatory, a joint project between ESA, NASA and JAXA, was proposed as the next major X-ray observatory but was later cancelled.[11] ESA later resurrected the project as the Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA) with a proposed launch in 2028.[12]\\r\\nThe data gathered by Chandra has greatly advanced the field of X-ray astronomy. Here are some examples of discoveries supported by observations from Chandra:\\r\\nUnlike optical telescopes which possess simple aluminized parabolic surfaces (mirrors), X-ray telescopes generally use a Wolter telescope consisting of nested cylindrical paraboloid and hyperboloid surfaces coated with iridium or gold. X-ray photons would be absorbed by normal mirror surfaces, so mirrors with a low grazing angle are necessary to reflect them. Chandra uses four pairs of nested mirrors, together with their support structure, called the High Resolution Mirror Assembly (HRMA); the mirror substrate is 2?cm-thick glass, with the reflecting surface a 33?nm iridium coating, and the diameters are 65?cm, 87?cm, 99?cm and 123?cm.[21] The thick substrate and particularly careful polishing allowed a very precise optical surface, which is responsible for Chandra's unmatched resolution: between 80% and 95% of the incoming X-ray energy is focused into a one-arcsecond circle. However, the thickness of the substrates limit the proportion of the aperture which is filled, leading to the low collecting area compared to XMM-Newton.\\r\\nChandra's highly elliptical orbit allows it to observe continuously for up to 55 hours of its 65-hour orbital period. At its furthest orbital point from Earth, Chandra is one of the most distant Earth-orbiting satellites. This orbit takes it beyond the geostationary satellites and beyond the outer Van Allen belt.[22]\\r\\nWith an angular resolution of 0.5 arcsecond (2.4 rad), Chandra possesses a resolution over 1000 times better than that of the first orbiting X-ray telescope.\\r\\nCXO uses mechanical gyroscopes,[23] which are sensors that help determine what direction the telescope is pointed.[24] Other navigation and orientation systems on board CXO include an aspect camera, Earth and Sun sensors, and reaction wheels. It also has two sets of thrusters, one for movement and another for offloading momentum.[24]\\r\\nThe Science Instrument Module (SIM) holds the two focal plane instruments, the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) and the High Resolution Camera (HRC), moving whichever is called for into position during an observation.\\r\\nACIS consists of 10 CCD chips and provides images as well as spectral information of the object observed. It operates in the photon energy range of 0.2ÿ10 keV. HRC has two micro-channel plate components and images over the range of 0.1ÿ10 keV. It also has a time resolution of 16 microseconds. Both of these instruments can be used on their own or in conjunction with one of the observatory's two transmission gratings.\\r\\nThe transmission gratings, which swing into the optical path behind the mirrors, provide Chandra with high resolution spectroscopy. The High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) works over 0.4ÿ10 keV and has a spectral resolution of 60ÿ1000. The Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (LETGS) has a range of 0.09ÿ3 keV and a resolution of 40ÿ2000.\\r\\nSummary:[25]\\r\\nX-Rays from Pluto.\\r\\nJupiter in X-ray light.\\r\\nTycho Supernova remnant in X-ray light.\\r\\nSN 2006gy (upper right) and parent galaxy NGC 1260.\\r\\nCXO orbit as of January 7, 2014.\\r\\nM31 Core in X-ray light.\\r\\nPSR B1509-58 - red, green and blue/max energy.\\r\\nTurbulence may prevent galaxy clusters from cooling.\\r\\nBright X-ray flare from Sagittarius A*, supermassive black hole in the Milky Way.[19]\\r\\nSNR 0519-69.0 - remains of an exploding star in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\\r\\nImages released to celebrate the International Year of Light 2015.\\r\\nCluster of newly formed stars in Orion Nebula.\\r\\nGK Persei: Nova of 1901.\\r\\nX-ray light rings from a neutron star in Circinus X-1.\\r\\nCygnus X-1, first strong black hole discovered.","input":"What kind of telescope is the chandra observatory?"},{"output":"Hiroshima","context":"","input":"What two japanese cities were bombed in ww2?"},{"output":"June 10, 1933","context":"Since 1872 the United States National Park System has grown from a single, public reservation called Yellowstone National Park to embrace over 450 natural, historical, recreational, and cultural areas throughout the United States, its territories, and island possessions. These areas include a diverse varieties of areas National Parks, National Monuments, National Memorials, National Military Parks, National Historic Sites, National Parkways, National Recreation Areas, National Seashores, National Scenic Riverways, National Scenic Trails, and others.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe national park idea has been credited to the artist George Catlin. In 1832 he traveled the northern Great Plains of the United States, where he became concerned about the destruction of the Indian civilization, wildlife, and wilderness as eastern settlements spread westward. He wrote, by some great protecting policy of government... in a magnificent park... a nations park, containing man and beast, in all the wild[ness] and freshness of their natures beauty! [2]\\r\\nCatlins vision had no immediate effect. In the east, romantic portrayals of nature by James Fenimore Cooper and Henry David Thoreau and painters Thomas Cole and Frederick Edwin Church began to compete with prevailing view of wilderness as a challenge to overcome. Slowly unspoiled nature and spectacular natural areas of the West became better known, the idea of saving such places became of interest.\\r\\nIn California, several state leaders sought to protect Yosemite Valley. In 1864, Sen. John Conness of California sponsored an act to transfer the valley and nearby Mariposa Big Tree Grove to the state so they might be used and preserved for the benefit of mankind. President Abraham Lincoln signed this act of Congress on June 30, 1864. California was granted the valley and the grove on condition that They would be held for public use, resort, and recreation...inalienable for all time.[2]\\r\\nThe Yellowstone country was first \\"officially\\" explored by David E. Folsom, Henry D. Washburn, and Ferdinand Hayden in 1869-71. A myth evolved that near the end of the Washburn expedition, discussion around the campfire led several of the members to suggest that the area be set aside for public use and not allow it to be sold to private individuals. This myth was successfully exploited by National Park advocates but eventually was debunked by historians.[3] An early ally in promoting a public reservation was the Northern Pacific Railroad Company. They were seeking major destinations for their route through Montana.[2] In an effort to reduce poaching and other misuse of the park, the U.S. Army established a fort in the area in 1881 and began park protection, establishing a pattern that would be continued by later park rangers.\\r\\nIn 1875, Mackinac National Park was created on a resort island in Lake Huron in Michigan, the second national park. As at Yellowstone, the army garrison at Fort Mackinac were in charge of supervising and improving the park. The fort and the national park were turned over to state control in 1895.\\r\\nU.S. cavalry units took up a position in California-controlled Yosemite Park in 1891 and took over some management duties. In 1906 the park was completely taken into federal control.\\r\\nWhile early emphasis had been on the creation of National Parks, there was another movement seeking to preserve the cliff dwellings, pueblo ruins, and early missions throughout the west and southwest. Often local ranchers would try to protect these ruins from plunder, but pot-hunters vandalized many sites. The effort began in Boston and spread to Washington, New York, Denver, and Santa Fe, during the 1880s and 1890s. Rep. John Fletcher Lacey of Iowa and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, created the Antiquities Act of 1906.[1]\\r\\nThe Antiquities Act of 1906 was designed to protect antiquities and objects of scientific interest on the public domain. It authorized the President, \\"to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest\\" that existed on public lands in the United States. The Act declared these sites to be National Monuments. It prohibited the excavation or removal of objects on Federal land unless a permit had been issued by the appropriate department.[1] Between 1906 and 1933 three Federal agencies, the Departments of Interior, Agriculture and War, initiated and administered separate groups of National Monuments.\\r\\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act on June 8, 1906. As early as 1889 Congress authorized the President to reserve the land on which the well known Casa Grande Ruin was located. In 1904, Dr. Edgar Lee Hewett made a review of all the Indian ruins on Federal lands in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. He recommended many sites for protection. Based on Hewetts report and many individual request and reports from throughout the west, between 1906 and 1916 the Interior Department recommended and Presidents Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson proclaimed twenty National Monuments.[1]\\r\\nOn September 24, 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Devils Tower as the first National Monument. Devils Tower is a Wyoming landmark, a 600-foot (180?m) high tower of rock, visible for nearly 100 miles (160?km). It has been a guidepost and a religious site. In December of that year, three more National Monuments were created. El Morro, New Mexico, is a wayside in the rugged desert lands used by Indians settlers and travelers for centuries as a watering hole and a place to leave their marks. The site includes prehistoric petroglyphs and hundreds of inscriptions from 17th century Spanish explorers and 19th century American emigrants and settlers. Montezuma Castle, Arizona, is one of the best preserved cliff dwellings. Petrified Forest, Arizona, is world-renowned for its petrified wood, Indian ruins and petroglyphs. Three of these original National Monuments later became the core of National Parks. Mukuntuweap became Zion, Sieur de Monts grew into Acadia, and Petrified Forest which was expanded by Congress to become a National Park of the same name. Three of the smaller areas were later abolished, those being Lewis and Clark Caverns, Shoshone Cavern, and Papago Saguaro.[1]\\r\\nMineral springs have been used for their medicinal properties since ancient times. By 1800, places like Saratoga Springs, New York, Berkeley Springs and White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, and French Lick, Indiana, were becoming popular American resorts. In 1832 Hot Springs, Arkansas, was set aside as a Federal reservation to protect 47 hot springs. In 1870 the area was protected by Congress as the Hot Springs Reservation and in 1921 it was made a National Park. Hot Springs National Park is a health resort and spa rather than a scenic area.\\r\\nIn 1902 the Federal Government purchased 32 mineral springs near Sulphur, Oklahoma, from the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians. The Sulphur Springs Reservation was placed under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior who shortly acquired some additional land. In 1906 Congress created Platt National Park which included the Sulphur Springs Reservation.[1]\\r\\nForty-four years after the establishment of Yellowstone, President Woodrow Wilson created the National Park Service on August 25, 1916. For years J. Horace McFarland, President of the American Civic Association; Secretaries of the Interior Walter Fisher and Franklin K. Lane; Presidents William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson; Frederick Law Olmsted Jr..; Representatives William Kent and John E. Raker of California; Senator Reed Smoot of Utah; Stephen T. Mather and Horace M. Albright had been seeking the creation of separate agency to manage the National Parks and Monuments.[1]\\r\\nOn June 10, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6166 which consolidated all National Parks and National Monuments, National Military Parks, the eleven National Cemeteries, National Memorials, and the National Capital Parks into a single National Park System. The National Park Service was directed to oversee all of these areas.[4] There were three significant results of this action:\\r\\nNational Capital Parks are the oldest parks in the National Park System. These parks began with the founding of the District of Columbia in 1790. The President appointed three Federal Commissioners to design a district ten miles (16?km) square on the Potomac River for the permanent seat of the Federal Government. The current National Capital Parks office is a direct lineal descendant of the original office established by the first commissioners of the District of Columbia in 1791.[5]\\r\\nPresident George Washington engaged Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant to design the new capital city. The L'Enfant Plan proposed a city of beauty. The plan was designed around a series of boulevards, parks and The Mall. Additionally, L'Enfant envisaged a Congress Garden and a President's Park; embellished with statues, columns, or obelisks; grand fountains; an equestrian statue of Washington; a Naval Column; and a zero milestone.\\r\\nRock Creek Park was authorized on September 27, 1890, two days after Sequoia and three days before Yosemite. Congress carried over some of the language of the Yellowstone Act into all three acts. Like Yellowstone, Rock Creek Park was \\"dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States,\\" where all timber, animals, and curiosities were to be retained \\"in their natural condition, as nearly as possible.\\" Though not a National Park, Rock Creek Park is a major urban park of the nation.[1]\\r\\nThe first memorial was authorized by the Continental Congress on January 25, 1776, to honor General Richard Montgomery, killed during an assault on the heights of Quebec in the midst of a snowstorm on the night of December 31, 1775. Montgomery commanded New York troops sent a few months before on an expedition designed to win Canada to the Revolutionary cause. It failed before Quebec, and Montgomery, became one of the first Revolutionary generals to lose his life on the field of battle. The Montgomery Memorial is not a part of the National Park System. But the chapel where it is located, St. Paul's Chapel, is a National Historic Landmark.\\r\\nThe Continental Congress climaxed its commemorative actions in August 1783 by resolving \\"that an equestrian statue of General Washington be erected where the residence of Congress shall be established.\\" The equestrian statue of Washington is executed by Clark Mills, placed in Washington Circle on Pennsylvania Avenue, and dedicated in 1859.\\r\\nWhen the centennial of Washington's birth came in 1832 with no satisfactory monument to in the National Capital, George Watterston, Librarian of Congress, and other civic leaders organized the Washington Monument Society, to erect an appropriate monument from private subscriptions. In 1848 Congress transferred a site on the Mall to the Society, and the cornerstone of the Washington Monument was laid on July 4. Slow progress was made worse by the Civil War. When the nation's first centennial came around in 1876 the Washington Monument was only a third completed. The United States Congress passed legislation authorizing the transfer of the Monument and site to the United States for completion and maintenance as a National Memorial. The Washington Monument was dedicated on February 21, 1885.\\r\\nIn 1933 these National Memorials were added to the National Park System and the National Memorial function assigned to the National Park Service, except Perry's Victory Memorial, which was administered by a commission until it was added to the System in 1936. Also, the fiscal functions of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission were assigned to the National Park Service in 1933 and the Memorial itself in 1938.[1]\\r\\nThe National Military Park line, including early battlefield monuments, began in 1781. Between 1890 and 1933 the War Department developed it into a National Military Park System. In 1933, there were twenty areas, 11 National Military Parks and 9 National Battlefield Sites.\\r\\nThe line started on October 29, 1781, when the Continental Congress authorized the first official on-site battlefield monument. It resolved: \\"That the United States in Congress assembled, will cause to be erected at York, in Virginia, a marble column, adorned with emblems of the alliance between the United States and His Most Christian Majesty; and inscribed with a succinct narrative of the surrender....\\"\\r\\nIn 1823 in Boston; Daniel Webster, Edward Everett, and other prominent citizens formed the Bunker Hill Battle Monument Association to save part of the historic field and erect on it a great commemorative monument. The cornerstone was laid on June 17, 1825. During the Revolutionary Centennial years, 1876ÿ83, Congress appropriated federal funds to match local funds for Revolutionary battle monuments, and through this means imposing monuments were erected at Bennington Battlefield, Vermont; Saratoga, Newburgh, and Oriskany, New York; Cowpens, South Carolina; Monmouth, New Jersey; and Groton, Connecticut. Of these, Cowpens is now a unit in the National Park System, and Bunker Hill, Bennington, Oriskany, and Monmouth are National Historic Landmarks.\\r\\nApril 30, 1864, in the midst of the Civil War, Pennsylvania chartered the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association to commemorate \\"the great deeds of valor... and the signal events which render these battlegrounds illustrious.\\" This association was among the earliest historic preservation organizations in the country. By 1890 it had acquired several hundred acres of land on the battlefield including areas in the vicinity of Spangler's Spring, the Wheatfield, Little Round Top, and the Peach Orchard as well as the small white frame house General Meade had used as headquarters.\\r\\nWith interest and support from both North and South Congress decided to go beyond the former battlefield monument concept to authorize the first four National Military Parks  Chickamauga & Chattanooga in 1890, Shiloh in 1894, Gettysburg in 1895, and Vicksburg in 1899. These areas were not selected at random but constituted, almost from the beginning, a rational system, designed to preserve major battlefields for historical and professional study and as lasting memorials to the great armies of both sides.\\r\\nThe National Military Park System was approaching maturity under the War Department in 1933 when all these battlefields were transferred to the National Park Service to become a significant and unique element in the National Park System.[1] All of the exhibits are permanent, and will always be shown in the museum.\\r\\nThe National Cemeteries in the National Park System are closely related to the National Military Parks. The battle of Gettysburg was scarcely over when Governor Andrew Y. Curtin (Pennsylvania) hastened to the field to assist local residents in caring for the dead or dying. More than 6,000 soldiers had been killed in action, and among 21,000 wounded hundreds more died each day. Initially interred in improvised graves on the battlefield, Curtin approved plans for a Soldier's National Cemetery.\\r\\nWilliam Saunders planned Gettysburg National Cemetery. He enclosed it with a massive stone wall, the lawns were framed by trees and shrubs. The graves were laid out in a great semicircle, state by state, around the site for a sculptured central feature, a Soldier's National Monument. The Soldier's National Cemetery, as it was then called, was dedicated by President Abraham Lincoln on November 19, 1863. The speaker's platform occupied the site set aside for the Soldier's National Monument, then awaiting future design. The immortal words of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address gave this spot a historical and patriotic association. Gettysburg National Cemetery became the honored property of the nation on May 1, 1872, now a century ago.\\r\\nCongress recognized the importance of honoring and caring for the remains of the war dead by enacting general legislation in 1867 which provided for a system of National Cemeteries developed by the War Department. Eleven of the National Cemeteries established under that authority were added to the National Park System in 1933. The act of 1867 also provided authority for preserving an important battlefield of the Indian wars when, on January 29, 1879, the Secretary of War designated \\"The National Cemetery of Custer's Battlefield Reservation.\\"[1]\\r\\nThe Antiquities Act of 1906 authorized the President to proclaim National Monuments not only on western public lands but on any lands owned or controlled by the United States. Between 1906 and 1933 successive Presidents proclaimed ten National Monuments on military reservations;\\r\\nThe authority to proclaim National Monuments on military reservations is still valid, no others have been proclaimed. Instead, historic but obsolete fortifications are declared surplus by the United States Department of Defense and transferred to the National Park Service, the States, or other political subdivisions following Congressional authorization.[1]\\r\\nBetween 1907 and 1933, six presidents proclaimed 21 National Monuments on National Forest lands administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture:\\r\\nThe first two National Monuments in the Department of Agriculture were Lassen Peak and Cinder Cone, created within Lassen Peak National Forest, California, on May 6, 1907, to preserve evidence of what was then the most recent volcanic activity in the United States south of Alaska. In 1916 these two monuments formed the nucleus for Lassen Volcanic National Park.\\r\\nFourteen of the other Department of Agriculture National Monuments were established to preserve \\"scientific objects\\". Moved by a report of plans to build an electric railway along its rim, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Grand Canyon National Monument on lands within the Grand Canyon National Forest, Arizona, on January 11, 1908. In 1919 the National Monument became the nucleus of Grand Canyon National Park.\\r\\nTwo days before leaving office, on March 2, 1909, Roosevelt proclaimed Mount Olympus National Monument, from lands in the Olympic National Forest, Washington. It was established to protect the Olympic elk and important stands of Sitka spruce, western hemlock, Douglas-fir, and Alaska cedar and redcedar. It formed the nucleus for Olympic National Park in 1938.\\r\\nThe authority to proclaim National Monuments on National Forest lands is still valid, only two others have been created between the Reorganization of 1933 and 1974. Both were placed under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, Cedar Breaks, Utah (August 22, 1933), and Jackson Hole, Wyoming (March 13, 1943).[1]\\r\\nThe long period between 1933 and 1964, began with the need to assimilate 71 diverse areas into the System. Among many other measures in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt instituted a broad program of natural resource conservation implemented in large part through the newly created Civilian Conservation Corps. At the program's peak in 1935, the Service had 600 CCC camps, 118 of them assigned to National Park System areas and 482 to State Parks, employing approximately 120,000 enrollees and 6,000 professionally trained supervisors.\\r\\nBy mid-century, a great and growing backlog of deferred park maintenance and development projects, posed vast new problems for the Service and System. It was an era marked by the dramatic inauguration and prosecution of Mission 66, the emergence of a national \\"crisis in outdoor recreation,\\" creation of the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission and the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, and mounting national concern for better preservation of America's vanishing wilderness.\\r\\nBetween the Reorganization of 1933 and the Reorganization of 1964, 102 areas were added to the System as defined today, increasing the total number from 137 to 239 The distribution of the new areas among categories is significant. Of the new additions, 11 were \\"Natural Areas\\", increasing their number from 58 to 69 or 19%. Seventy-five were \\"Historical Areas\\", increasing their number from 77 to 152 or 96%. Fifteen were \\"Recreation Areas\\", increasing their number from one to 16, or 1500%. It is clear that during this period the growth rate for Natural Areas noticeably diminished from previous levels and by comparison with the rate for other categories, even though very important additions of natural lands were still being made. On the other hand, the growth rates for Historical and Recreation Areas accelerated sharply. It took the Service a generation, from 1933 to 1964, to assimilate these 102 diverse new areas and the 71 areas added by the Reorganization of 1933 and incorporate them securely into one National Park System.\\r\\nJackson Hole, had been talked of as a possible addition to Yellowstone as early as 1892, and from 1916 onward the Service and Department of the Interior actively sought its preservation in the National Park System. It was John D. Rockefeller Jr., however, who rescued Jackson Hole. In 1926 he visited the area and discovered the cheap commercial development, on private lands, in the midst of superlative natural beauty. There were dance halls, hot dog stands, filling stations, rodeo grand stands, and billboards, blocking the view of the Teton Range.\\r\\nRockefeller began a land acquisition program. In a few years he held over 33,000 acres (130?km2) in Jackson Hole. He offered these lands as a gift to the United States. Meanwhile, opposition developed among cattlemen, dude ranchers, packers, hunters, timber interests, and local Forest Service officials. By 1943, there was still no park legislation. Rockefeller indicated he might dispose of the property if no action was pending. On March 15, 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed the Jackson Hole National Monument, consolidating 33,000 acres (130?km2) donated by Rockefeller with 179,000 acres (720?km2) withdrawn from Teton National Forest. Thus, Grand Teton National Park was created.\\r\\nPresident Roosevelt's proclamation unleashed a storm of criticism which had been brewing for years among western members of Congress. Rep. Frank A. Barrett of Wyoming and others introduced bills to abolish the monument and to repeal Section 2 of the Antiquities Act containing the President's authority to proclaim National Monuments. A bill to abolish the monument passed Congress in 1944 but was vetoed by President Roosevelt. The President noted in his veto that Presidents of both political parties, beginning with Theodore Roosevelt, had established ample precedents by proclaiming 82 National Monuments, seven of which were larger than Jackson Hole. The proclamation was nevertheless also contested in court, where it was strongly defended by the Departments of Justice and Interior and upheld. A compromise was worked out and embodied in legislation approved by President Harry S Truman on September 14, 1950. It combined Jackson Hole National Monument and the old Grand Teton National Park in a \\"new Grand Teton National Park\\" containing some 298,000 acres (1,210?km2), with special provisions regarding taxes and hunting. It also prohibited establishing or enlarging National Parks or Monuments in Wyoming in the future except by express authorization of Congress.[1]\\r\\nSeventy-five Historical Areas were added to the National Park System between 1933 and 1964, including nine National Historic Sites and one International Park in non-federal ownership. Areas represented nine historic themes: I. The Original Inhabitants (6); II. European Exploration & Settlement (12): III. Development of the English Colonies, 1700-1775 (2); IV. Major American Wars (10): V. Political and Military Affairs (16); VI. Westward Expansion 1763-1898 (15); VII America At Work (9): VIII The Contemplative Society (0); IX Society and Social Conscience (5).\\r\\nMuch of this would not have happened without the Historic Sites Act of 1935, a logical follow-up to the Reorganization of 1933. On November 10, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited his friend and neighbor, Major Gist Blair, to give consideration \\"to some kind of plan which would coordinate the broad relationship of the Federal Government to State and local interest in the maintenance of historic sources and places throughout the country.\\r\\nThe Act declared \\"that it is a national policy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings and objects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States'.\\" This new and greatly broadened national policy has been the cornerstone of the Federal Government's historic preservation program ever since 1935, reaffirmed both in the Act of October 26, 1949, which created the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. To carry out the policy, the Act assigned broad powers, duties and functions to the Secretary of the Interior to be exercised through the National Park Service, among them:\\r\\nThe Act established an Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings and Monuments.\\r\\nSome of the most important historical additions to the system between 1933 and 1964 are almost lost to sight in this long thematic list. Jefferson National Expansion Memorial was the first National Historic Site established under authority of the Historic Sites Act. More importantly, its 37 square blocks embraced a key urban area on the historic St. Louis waterfront  the first major effort of the NPS, after National Capital Parks, to conserve and develop a large and important urban historic site. Some architectural monuments, including the Old St. Louis Post Office and the Cathedral, have been carefully preserved, but the main feature of the area is the only major national memorial of modern design in the United States, and one of a small number in the world  Eero Saarinen's stainless steel Arch.\\r\\nIn 1948 Congress authorized another major urban project, the Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, the most important historical area in the United States, embracing Independence Hall and Square, Congress Hall, Carpenters Hall, and many other sites and buildings associated with independence and the establishment of a government under the Constitution. The method of analyzing complex urban problems was used in Boston, where it led to authorization of Minute Man National Historical Park in 1959 and other sites, including the Bunker Hill Monument, Faneuil Hall, and the Old Boston State House. A commission was established for New York City, where a complex of urban monuments were added, including Federal Hall National Memorial, Castle Clinton, Grant Memorial, Hamilton Grange, Theodore Roosevelt's Birthplace, and Sagamore Hill, to the previously authorized Statue of Liberty National Monument, whose boundaries were extended to include Ellis Island.\\r\\nThe Historic American Buildings Survey was organized in 1933 upon the initiative of Charles E. Peterson of the National Park Service in cooperation with officials of the Library of Congress and the American Institute of Architects. Since 1933 the HABS has gathered more than 30,000 measured drawings, 40,000 photographs, and 13,000 pages of documentation for more than 13,000 of the Nation's historic buildings.\\r\\n. The National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings was organized after passage of the Historic Sites Act in 1935. Beginning in 1960, the responsibilities of this Survey staff were extended to include recommendation of an important series of National Historic Landmarks, officially designated by the Secretary of the Interior. On October 9, 1960 Secretary of the Interior Fred A. Seaton announced the first official list of 92 historic sites and buildings eligible for designation as National Historic Landmarks.\\r\\nThe Inter-Agency Archaeological Salvage Program was organized by the National Park Service in 1946 at the request of the Committee for Recovery of Archaeological Remains to coordinate the salvage of irreplaceable pre-historic and historic Indian artifacts from projected reservoir sites in river valleys throughout the United States, before flooding. This program, which has been conducted for a quarter of a century in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and universities, museums, and research institutions throughout the country, has enormously deepened knowledge of American prehistory.[1]\\r\\nThe Service responded to the emerging social and economic forces of the New Deal era, by expanding its cooperative relationships with the States, securing enactment of the comprehensive Park, Parkway and Recreation Area Study Act of 1936, and initiating four new types of Federal park areas  National Parkways, National Recreation Areas, National Seashores and Recreational Demonstration Areas. By the end of this period, fifteen of the over 50 such areas remained under the administration of the National Park Service. Because they had much in common, they were collectively designated Recreation Areas in the Reorganization of 1964.[1]\\r\\nNational Parkways\\r\\nNational Seashores\\r\\nRecreational Demonstration Areas\\r\\nReservoir-related Recreation Areas\\r\\nThe origin of Recreation Areas as a category in the National Park System stemmed in important part from widened responsibilities assigned to the Service beginning in the 1930s. A central feature of these new responsibilities was administration of hundreds of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps located in State Parks. The National Park Service had actively encouraged the state park movement ever since Stephen Tyng Mather helped organize the National Conference on State Parks at Des Moines, Iowa, in 1921. It was natural for the Service to be asked to assume national direction of Emergency Conservation Work in state parks when that program was launched in 1933. Fortunately for the Service an exceptional administrator, Conrad L. Wirth, was available to lead this complex nationwide program. It was a large and dynamic undertaking, at its peak involving administration of 482 CCC camps allotted to state parks employing almost 100,000 enrollees on work projects guided by a technical and professional staff numbering several thousand.\\r\\nAs this program got under way it became painfully evident that in the 1930s most states lacked any kind of comprehensive plans for state park systems. In 1941 the Service published its first comprehensive report, A Study of the Park and Recreation Problem in the United States, a careful review of the whole problem of recreation and of national, state, county, and municipal parks in the United States. Interrupted by World War II, Director Wirth arranged for these studies to be resumed with the inception of Mission 66, and a second comprehensive report was published in 1964 entitled Parks for America, A Survey of Park and Related Resources in the Fifty States and a Preliminary Plan. Numerous land planning studies of individual areas, river basins, and regions accompanied and supported these comprehensive reports. The four new types of Federal Recreation Areas added to the System between 1933 and 1964 were generally consistent with recommendations in these studies.[1]\\r\\nThe modern parkway, fruit of the automobile age, appears to have its origins in the Westchester County Parkways, New York, built between 1913 and 1930. At first, Congress also applied the idea locally  in the District of Columbia  but later undertook projects more clearly national in scope. Congress authorized its first parkway project in 1913, the four-mile (6?km) Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, to connect Potomac Park with Rock Creek Park and the National Zoological Park. In 1928, Congress authorized the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway to link the District of Columbia with Mount Vernon in commemoration of the bicentennial of Washington's birth. In 1930 this highway was renamed the George Washington Memorial Parkway, and enlarged in concept to extend from Mount Vernon all the way to Great Falls in Virginia, and from Fort Washington to Great Falls in Maryland (Alexandria and the District of Columbia excepted).[1]\\r\\nDuring World War II Congress extended the National Capital parkway network by authorizing the Suitland Parkway to provide an access road to Andrews Air Force Base, and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, whose initial unit provided access to Fort George G. Meade.\\r\\nThe Colonial Parkway in Virginia was the first authorized by Congress beyond the District of Columbia vicinity. It provided a landscaped 23-mile (37?km) roadway link between Jamestown Island, Colonial Williamsburg, and Yorktown Battlefield as part of Colonial National Monument, authorized in 1930.\\r\\nA new era for National Parkways began with authorization of the Blue Ridge and Natchez Trace Parkways during the 1930s. These were not fairly short county or metropolitan parkways serving a variety of local and national traffic but protected recreational roadways traversing hundreds of miles of scenic and historic rural landscape. These different National Parkways started out as public works projects during the New Deal and were transformed into units of the National Park System.\\r\\nThe Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park served as a prototype for the Blue Ridge Parkway. President Herbert Hoover conceived the idea of the Skyline Drive during vacations at his Rapidan Camp. It was planned in 1931 and begun as a relief project in 1932.\\r\\nFollowing President Roosevelt's election Congress quickly enacted the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 to stimulate the economy. Among other provisions it authorized the Public Works Administrator, Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes, to prepare a comprehensive program of public works. Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, aided by others, seized the opportunity to propose the construction of a scenic roadway linking Shenandoah and Great Smoky Mountains National Park as a public works project.[1]\\r\\nThe Blue Ridge Parkway is considered by many to be a Service triumph in parkway design, providing the motorist with a serene environment conducive to leisurely travel and enjoyment while affording him many insights into the beauty, history, and culture of the Southern Highlands. The 469-mile (755?km) parkway, sometimes called a grand balcony, alternates sweeping views of mountain and valley with intimate glimpses of the fauna and flora of the Blue Ridge and close-up views of typical mountain structures, like Mabry's Mill, built of logs by pioneers and still operating.\\r\\nThe Natchez Trace Parkway is the second major National Parkway, a projected 450-mile (720?km) roadway through a protected zone of forest, meadow, and field which generally follows the route of the historic Natchez Trace from Nashville, Tennessee, to Natchez, Mississippi. The Old Natchez Trace was once an Indian path, then a wilderness road, and finally from 1800 to 1830 a highway binding the old Southwest to the Union. The parkway was completed in 2003 with the final link south of Nashville, Tennessee. The parkway links historic and natural features including Mount Locust, the earliest inn on the Trace, Emerald Mound, one of the largest Indian ceremonial structures in the United States, Chickasaw Village and Bynum Mounds in Mississippi, and Colbert's Ferry and Metal Ford in Tennessee.[1]\\r\\nLike the Blue Ridge Parkway, two other Recreation Areas in today's National Park System trace their origin back to the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933  Catoctin Mountain Park, Maryland, and Prince William Forest Park, Virginia.\\r\\nAmong many other features, the National Industrial Recovery Act authorized federal purchases of land considered submarginal for farming but valuable for recreation purposes. By 1936, 46 projects containing 397,000 acres (1,610?km2) had been set up in 24 different states, mostly near metropolitan centers, to provide outdoor recreation for people from crowded cities. It was intended from the beginning that most of these projects would be turned over to states and cities for operation and in 1942 Congress provided the necessary authority. By 1946 most of the conveyances had been completed. The National Park Service retained Catoctin Mountain Park, site of Camp David, but 4,500 of its acres were transferred to Maryland. Prince William Forest Park (formerly Chopawamsic) was retained as a unit administrated by National Capital Parks.\\r\\nSome recreational demonstration lands were also added to Acadia, Shenandoah, White Sands, and Hopewell Village. Now largely forgotten, recreational demonstration projects left several permanent marks on the National Park System and illustrated again the ability of the Service to help meet changing social and economic conditions in the nation.[1]\\r\\nFive National Recreation Areas were added to the System between 1933 and 1964. This new type of federal park area grew out of large scale reclamation projects like Hoover Dam and multi purpose river basin development programs like the Tennessee Valley Authority which began in the 1930s and spread to river valleys in all parts of the country after World War II.\\r\\nLake Mead was the first National Recreation Area. The Boulder Canyon Project Act, passed in 1928, authorized the Bureau of Reclamation to construct Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. Work began in 1931 and the dam, highest in the Western Hemisphere, was completed in 1935. The next year, under provisions of an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Park Service assumed responsibility for all recreational activities at Lake Mead.\\r\\nCoulee Dam National Recreation Area (now called Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area) was established in 1946, under an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation patterned after Lake Mead. Construction of Grand Coulee Dam began in 1933 and the dam went into operation in 1941. It impounds a huge body of water named Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, 151 miles (243?km) long with 660 miles (1,060?km) of shoreline.\\r\\nAlthough Millerton Lake, California, Lake Texoma, Oklahoma-Texas, and the north unit of Flaming Gorge, Utah-Wyoming were administered by the Service for a time, the first was subsequently turned over to the State of California, the second to the Army Corps of Engineers, and the last to the Forest Service.\\r\\nThree more National Recreation Areas established during the 1950s are still in the National Park System today. Shadow Mountain, adjoining the west entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park, embraces the recreational features of Lake Granby and Shadow Mountain Lake, two units of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project. Glen Canyon was established in 1958 to provide for recreational activities on Lake Powell formed behind Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River, one of the highest dams in the world. The Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area, California, was established by Act of Congress in 1962. The National Park Service, however, administers the recreational facilities only at Whiskeytown Reservoir, while the Forest Service takes care of similar, more extensive facilities at Shasta and Trinity.\\r\\nBy 1964, application of the National Recreation Area concept to major impoundments behind Federal dams, whether constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation or the Corps of Engineers, appeared to be well accepted by Congress. Eight more reservations of this type were authorized as additions to the National Park System between 1964 and 1972.\\r\\nThe first seashore recreation survey in the mid-1930s resulted in a recommendation that 12 major stretches of unspoiled Atlantic and Gulf Coast shoreline, with 437 miles (703?km) of beach, be preserved. World War II intervened and no action occurred before 1954. Then only one of the proposed areas was created: Cape Hatteras National Seashore, North Carolina. All but one  Cape Cod  had become commercial developments. A new shoreline surveys resulted in several major reports including Our Vanishing Shoreline (1955); A Report on the Seashore Recreation Survey of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts (1955); Our Fourth Shore, Great Lakes Shoreline Recreation Area Survey (1959); and Pacific Coast Recreation Area Survey (1959). By 1972 fruits of this program included eight National Seashores and four National Lakeshores of which the first four were authorized before 1964.\\r\\nThe National Seashore concept reached the Pacific Coast in 1962 with authorization of Point Reyes, California, embracing more than forty miles of shoreline including historic Drakes Bay, Tomales Point, and Point Reyes itself. The National Seashore concept reached the Gulf Coast in 1962 also with authorization of Padre Island, Texas. This great shore island stretches for 113 miles (182?km) along the Texas coast from Corpus Christi on the north almost to Mexico on the south, and varies in width from a few hundred yards to about three miles (4.8?km). There is some private development at each end of the island.\\r\\nThe 1960s brought about public awareness of America's natural and historical wealth. The Johnson Administration became the start of a 'park's for people' mindset.[6] Director Hartzog has been the superintendent of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in St. Louis and was a supporter of public involvement and publicly accessible parks. It was the second 50 years that saw a significant increase in parks accessible to the general populations.[6]\\r\\nDuring the 1960s numerous legal challenges arose over the mission of the National Park Service. Using the court decisions, Congress supplemented and clarified the Organic Act of 1916 through the General Authorities Act of 1970. Additional challenges during the 1970s required that Congress again clarify the mission of the National Park Service. The 1979 amendment to the General Authorities Act of 1970 has been come known as the Redwood amendment, as it also contained language expanding Redwood National Park. The key part of that act, as amended, is:\\r\\nCongress declares that the national park system, which began with establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, has since grown to include superlative natural, historic, and recreation areas in every major region of the United States, its territories and island possessions; that these areas, though distinct in character, are united through their inter-related purposes and resources into one national park system as cumulative expressions of a single national heritage; that, individually and collectively, these areas derive increased national dignity and recognition of their superlative environmental quality through their inclusion jointly with each other in one national park system preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all the people of the United States; and that it is the purpose of this Act to include all such areas in the System and to clarify the authorities applicable to the system. Congress further reaffirms, declares and directs that the promotion and regulation of the various areas of the National Park system, as defined in section Ic of this title, shall be consistent with and founded in the purpose established by section I of this title (the Organic Act provisions), to the common benefit of all the people of the United States. The authorization of activities shall be construed and the protection, management, and administration of these areas shall be conducted in light of the high public value and integrity of the National Park System and shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes for which these various areas have been established, except as may have been or shall be directly and specifically provided by Congress. (16 USC Ia-I)\\r\\n[7]\\r\\nThe first national lakeshores were created in 1966 from some of the remaining unspoiled or unique coastlines of the Great Lakes. The first lakeshores were Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in the Upper Penninsla of Michigan and the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in Indiana as a part of the Chicago area.[6] In 1970, two additional lakeshores were added. Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore on Michigans western shore of Lake Michigan, and Apostle Islands National Lakeshore on Wisconsins Lake Superior shore.[6]\\r\\nHeritage areas were first established to identify regions having a common cultural impact on the development of the United States. The Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail in the Virginia, Maryland and District of Columbia was established on March 28, 1983. Fourteen areas exited by November 12, 1996.[6] Initially, all the heritage areas were in the east and northeast. Today, they exist from coast to coast. The entire State of Tennessee has been designated as the Tennessee Civil War Heritage Area[8]\\r\\nDuring the Richard Nixon presidency, public parks expanded with the creation of the two gateway parks. Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco became the western book end to Gateway National Recreation Area in New York City. Both were specifically created to serve these two major urban areas and create open space, rather than to preserve a specific scenic or cultural value.[6]\\r\\nOn August 15, 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed into law the creation of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, comprising 15 park units, ranging over 5,000 acres, and included 48 miles of the Chattahoochee River, in the Atlanta metropolitan area.\\r\\nIn 1977, President Jimmy Carter created a dozen national monuments, in Alaska. The controversy that ensued lead to the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). Through this act, Congress affirmed the Executive Order, adding to it. The act set aside 47?million acres (190,000?km2) to the National Park System and 54 acres (220,000?m2) to the National Wildlife Refuge System.[6] The act provided for the creation or expansion of Denali National Park, WrangellÿSt. Elias National Park and Preserve, Gates Of The Arctic National Park and Preserve, Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Kobuk Valley National Park, Katmai National Park and Preserve, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Kenai Fjords National Park, Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, Cape Krusenstern National Monument, Admiralty Island National Monument, Misty Fjords National Monument, Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve, Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, Noatak National Preserve, Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, and made significant changes to the notable Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\\r\\nPresident Ronald Reagan added eighteen new units to the National Park System during his eight years in the White House.[9]\\r\\nPresident George H. W. Bush added fourteen new units to the National Park System during his four years in the White House.[9]\\r\\nPresident Bill Clinton added nineteen new units to the National Park System, and de-authorized one during his eight years in the White House.[9]\\r\\nPresident George W. Bush approved/created seven new units of the national park service during his eight years. In that period he also approved the deauthorization of the Oklahoma City National Memorial in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.[9]\\r\\nPresident Barack Obama has approved nineteen new National Park Units since taking office in January 2009 (through February 2016). As of January, 2011, five parks have been authorized by Congress with the intention of adding them to the National Park system upon land acquisition or monument completion.[9] The National Park Service will end furloughs, known as sequestration, for US Park Police on June 1, 2013.[10]","input":"When was the us national park system established?"},{"output":"the New River Gorge Bridge","context":"The New River Gorge Bridge is a steel arch bridge 3,030 feet (924?m) long over the New River Gorge near Fayetteville, West Virginia, in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. With an arch 1,700 feet (518?m) long, the New River Gorge Bridge was for many years the world's longest single-span arch bridge;[4][5] it is now the fourth longest. Part of U.S. Route 19, its construction marked the completion of Corridor L of the Appalachian Development Highway System. The bridge is crossed by an average of 16,200 motor vehicles per day.[1]\\r\\nThe roadway of the New River Gorge Bridge is 876 feet (267?m) above the New River.[5] The New River Gorge Bridge is one of the highest vehicular bridges in the world, and is currently the third highest in the United States. In 2005, the structure gained nationwide attention when the US Mint issued the West Virginia state quarter with the bridge depicted on one side. In 2013, the bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction began on the bridge in June 1974, and was completed on October 22, 1977. The bridge was designed by the Michael Baker Company under the direction of Chief Engineer Clarence V. Knudsen, and executed by U.S. Steel's American Bridge Division. The final cost of construction was $37 million (approximately $4 million over bid). It is made from COR-TEN steel. The use of COR-TEN in construction presented several challenges; notable among them was ensuring that the weld points weathered at the same rate as the rest of the steel.[6]\\r\\nAt the time, the bridge was the West Virginia Department of Highways' largest project in its history, important both in terms of its overall cost, and that the federal government provided 70 percent of the funding. Construction gave a boost to the state and local economy; completion improved transportation.[7] The bridge cut the vehicle travel time from one side of the gorge to the other from about 45 minutes to 45 seconds.[5][8]\\r\\nOn August 14, 2013, the bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[3] Even though it was not yet 50 years old, it was listed for its exceptional impact on local transportation and its engineering significance.[7]\\r\\nThe New River Gorge Bridge is within the National Park Service's New River Gorge National River area, which protects this portion of the New River Gorge. At the northern end of the bridge, the Park Service operates a visitor center; it has scenic overlooks and a staircase that descends part of the way into the gorge.\\r\\nA steel catwalk two feet (60?cm) wide runs the full length of the bridge underneath the roadway. Originally built to facilitate inspections, the catwalk is open for guided, handicapped-accessible quarter-mile \\"Bridge Walk\\"[9] tours; visitors use safety rigging.[5][10][11]\\r\\nSince its opening, the bridge has been the centerpiece of Fayette County's \\"Bridge Day\\", held the third Saturday of every October.[5] This festival includes demonstrations of rappelling, ascending, and BASE jumping.[12] Bungee jumping, however, has been banned during Bridge Day since 1993.\\r\\nThe bridge is closed to vehicular traffic during the festival. Prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, two of the bridge's four lanes were open to traffic during the festivals. Since 2001, security concerns have caused the entire span to be closed to vehicles during these events.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first person to jump off the New River Gorge Bridge was Burton Ervin, who lives in Cowen, West Virginia, and was a coal-mine foreman. Burton jumped on August 1, 1979, using a conventional North American Aerodynamics Mini Rig System with a 32-foot Lopo canopy. Four BASE jumpers have died at the bridge, three of these during Bridge Day festivals.[13][14][15][16]\\r\\nProbably because of its height (and lack of barriers), the bridge has regularly attracted suicide jumpers, despite its relatively remote location.[17][18]\\r\\nThe West Virginia state quarter, released in 2005, features the New River Gorge Bridge.\\r\\nBridge as seen from the National Park Service Visitors Center, with fog in the New River Gorge below\\r\\nClose-up of the bridge supports\\r\\nWalkway to observation area near the Visitors Center\\r\\nThe New River Gorge Bridge as seen from a small fixed-wing airplane.

Both languages are generally mutually intelligible, yet there are differences in spelling, grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary, as well as the predominant source of loanwords.[1][2][3] The differences can range from those mutually unintelligible with one another, to those having a closer familial resemblance. The regionalised and localised varieties of Malay can become a catalyst for intercultural conflict, especially in higher education.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo non-native speakers the two varieties may seem identical, but to native speakers the differences are noticeable through both diction and accent. They affect the broadcasting industry with regard to foreign language subtitling, for example, in DVD movies and on cable TV. In order to reach a wider audience, both Indonesian and Malay subtitles are sometimes displayed in a movie, along with other language subtitles. Another example is Malaysian TV providing Malay subtitling on Indonesian sinetrons (TV dramas) aired in Malaysia,[7] and vice versa.[8]\\r\\nThe Malay language in Indonesia and Malaysia also differs in recognition, where in Malaysia it enjoys status as the national language (Malaysian language),[9] while in Indonesia it is considered as a regional language in Malay-speaking areas such as the eastern coast of Sumatra and West Kalimantan.[10][11] The term \\"Malay language\\" (Bahasa Melayu) in Indonesia and Malaysia invites different perceptions from its respective people.[12] To Malaysians, the Malay language is generally understood as the national language of Malaysia, with Malaysian language (Bahasa Malaysia) being the standardized register of Malay in the country.[13] Between 1986 and 2007, the term Bahasa Melayu was used instead of Bahasa Malaysia, until the latter was reinstated, in order to instill a sense of belonging among Malaysians of all races, rather than just Malays.[14][15] Therefore, there was no clear distinction between the use of the term Malay (Bahasa Melayu) and the national language of Malaysia (Bahasa Malaysia). In Brunei, where Malay is also an official language, the language is known as Bahasa Melayu and in English as \\"Malay\\".[16]\\r\\nIn Indonesia, however, there is a clear distinction between \\"Malay language\\" (Bahasa Melayu) and \\"Indonesian\\" (Bahasa Indonesia). Indonesian is the national language which serves as the unifying language of Indonesia.[17] The term \\"Malay\\" is reserved for the language indigenous to the Malay people. Thus, \\"Malay\\" is considered a regional language in Indonesia, enjoying the same status as Javanese, Bataknese, Sundanese, Buginese, Balinese and others.[18] Moreover, to some Indonesians, the term \\"Malay\\" is more often associated with Malaysia and the Malaysian national language.[19]\\r\\nIn Malaysia, the terms \\"Indonesian Malay\\" and \\"Malaysian Malay\\" are sometimes used for Indonesian and Malaysian as spoken in Malaysia. In Indonesia, \\"Indonesian Malay\\" refers to the Malay spoken by the Malay peoples of Indonesia, that is, to Malay as a regional language in Sumatra, though it is rarely used.[20] Bahasa Malaysia and Bahasa Melayu are used interchangeably in reference to Malay in Malaysia.\\r\\nBefore the 20th century, Malay was written in a local modified form of the Arabic alphabet known as Jawi. During the 20th century, Malay written with Roman letters, known as Rumi, almost completely replaced Jawi in everyday life. The romanisations originally used in Malaya (now part of Malaysia) and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) reflected their past history as British and Dutch colonial possessions respectively. In Malaya, the romanisation of Malay, devised by Richard Wilkinson[21] was influenced by English, whereas in the Dutch East Indies, the system devised by C. A. Van Ophuijsen was influenced by Dutch.[22] As a result, in Indonesia, the vowel in the English word 'moon' was formerly represented oe, as in Dutch, although the official spelling of this sound was changed to u in 1947 when the Republican Spelling System was used.[23]\\r\\nSimilarly, until 1972, the initial consonant of the English 'chin' was represented in Malaysia as ch, whereas in Indonesia, it continued to follow Dutch and used tj. Hence the word for 'grandchild' used to be written as chuchu in Malaysia and tjoetjoe in Indonesia, until a unified spelling system was introduced in 1972 (known in Indonesia as Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan or the 'Perfected Spelling') which removed most differences between the two varieties: Malay ch and Indonesian tj became c: hence cucu.[24] Indonesia abandoned the spelling dj (for the consonant at the beginning of the word 'Jakarta') to conform to the j already in use in Malaysia, while the old Indonesian j for the semivowel at the beginning of the English 'young', was replaced with y as in Malaysia. Likewise, the velar fricative which occurs in many Arabic loanwords, which used to be written 'ch' in Indonesian, became kh in both languages.[24] However, oe was retained in some proper names, such as the name of the first President, Sukarno (written as Soekarno), and his successor Suharto, (written as Soeharto). The ch and dj letter combinations are still encountered in names such as Achmad and Djojo (pronounced as Akhmad and Joyo respectively), although the post-1972 spelling is now favoured.\\r\\nAlthough the representations of speech sounds are now largely identical in the Indonesian and Malay standards, a number of minor spelling differences remain, usually for historical reasons. For instance, the word for 'money' is written as wang in Malaysia, but uang in Indonesia, the word for 'try' is written as cuba in Malaysia, but coba in Indonesia, the word for 'because' is written as kerana in Malaysia, but karena in Indonesia, while the word for 'cake' is written as kuih in Malaysia, but kue in Indonesia. One notable difference in punctuation between the two languages is the use of different decimal marks; Indonesian, influenced by Dutch, uses the decimal comma,[25] whereas Malay, influenced by English, uses the decimal point.[26]\\r\\nPronunciation also tends to be very different, with East Malaysia, Brunei and East Indonesia pronouncing words in a form called Bahasa Baku,[27] where the words are pronounced as spelt.[28] and enunciation tends to be clipped, staccato and faster than on the Malay Peninsula, which is spoken at a more languorous pace. Many vowels are pronounced (and were formerly spelt) differently in Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and Sumatra: tujuh is pronounced (and was spelt) tujoh, pilih as pileh, etc., and many final a's tend to be pronounced as schwas; [e] and [o] are also allophones of /i/ and /u/ in closed final syllables in peninsular Malaysian, Singaporean and Sumatran varieties of Malay.[29][30]\\r\\nIndonesian differs from Malaysian in the quantity of loanwords from Javanese, Dutch and other languages. For example, the word for 'post office' in Malaysia is \\"pejabat pos\\" (in Indonesia this means 'post officer'), whereas in Indonesia it is \\"kantor pos\\", from the Dutch word for office, kantoor. There are also some Portuguese influences: in Indonesia, Christmas is known as \\"Natal\\", whereas Malaysia uses \\"Krismas\\", derived from English (or in some cases also \\"Natal\\", due to Indonesian influence). Pronunciation of some loanwords in Standard Malay follows English, while some in Indonesian follows Dutch, for example Malay \\"televisyen\\" (from English: television) and Indonesian \\"televisi\\" (from Dutch: televisie), the \\"-syen\\" and \\"-si\\" also prevail in some other words. There are also instances where the Malaysian version derives from English pronunciation while the Indonesian version takes its cue from Latin. The Latin preference of the (older) Indonesian intellectuals in these instances may be ascribed to the influence of their classical-oriented education when Gymnasium schools were established during the Dutch colonial period?: compare Malay kualiti, kuantiti, majoriti, minoriti and universiti with Indonesian kualitas, kuantitas, mayoritas, minoritas and universitas.\\r\\nSome words which are spelt the same in both languages may even carry entirely different meanings in the other language, potentially leading to humorous or embarrassing situations: while baja means \\"steel\\" in Indonesian, in Malaysian it means \\"fertiliser\\". Also, whereas the Indonesian word butuh means \\"require\\" or \\"need\\", in Malaysian, it is a vulgar slang term equivalent to \\"cunt/cock\\". Conversely, where the word \\"banci\\" seems innocuous enough in Malaysia (\\"census\\"), in Indonesia it is a derogatory term for \\"transvestite\\".\\r\\nThe relatively large share of Islamic (Arabic or Persian) loan words shared by Malaysian and Indonesian often poses no difficulty in comprehension and usage, although some forms may have developed a (slightly) different meaning or have become obsolete either in Malaysian or in Indonesian, e.g. khidmat, wakil (see below).\\r\\ndugaan\\r\\nastronot\\r\\nbelakang panggung\\r\\nhalte bus from Dutch bushalte\\r\\nbandar (a city in the sea shore or port city in Indonesian)\\r\\nkini,\\r\\nterkini,\\r\\naktual (from Dutch actueel)\\r\\nBesides vocabulary differences, there are also a number of false friends in both languages. As these words are in quite common use in either or both of the languages, misunderstandings can arise.\\r\\nOne of the most important aspect in differences between Malaysian and Indonesian is the degree of influence from English. Apart from being heavily influenced by the Dutch language, Indonesian language also adopted a significant number of English loanwords in its vocabulary, although English did not play significant role on the Indonesian language and in fact most of these vocabulary are of Dutch origin - Dutch and English share a similar Germanic origin, and Dutch has also borrowed from Latin, although to a lesser extent than English. There have been many changes in Indonesian as a result of its historical development. Words have been freely borrowed from English and only partly assimilated, in many cases, to the Indonesian patterns of structure.[31]\\r\\nBy the late 1970s, English words began pouring into the language, leading one commentator, writing in 1977, to refer to the \\"trend towards Indo-Saxonization\\",[32] known in Indonesian as pengindosaksonan. A great many borrowings from English sometimes fulfill no communicative need, expressing concepts adequately covered by existing words. Among the examples are: akurat instead of tepat (accurate), aliansi in the place of sekutu (alliance), eksis rather than ada (exist), kandidat as well as calon (candidate), konklusi instead of kesimpulan (conclusion) kontaminasi in the place of pencemaran (contamination), opini rather than pendapat (opinion) and opsi in the place of pilihan (option). Contrary to its Indonesian counterpart, Malay has shown a remarkable resilience, despite formerly being part of British Empire.[33]\\r\\nSome in Indonesia view this trend of excessive borrowings as \\"language dynamism\\", while some Malaysian[clarification needed] linguists called it mass \\"language pollution\\",[34] and lack of creativity in creating new terms.\\r\\nThe original text in Indonesian:\\r\\nThe same text rendered in Malaysian:\\r\\nEnglish translation:\\r\\nThe rift of evolution between the two languages is based more on political nuance and the history of their formation than on cultural reasons. As a result, views regarding each other's languages differ amongst Malaysians and Indonesians. In Malaysia, the national language is Malaysian; in Indonesia, it is Indonesian. Malaysians tend to assert that Malaysian and Indonesian are merely different varieties of the same language, while Indonesians tend to treat them as separate ÿ albeit closely related ÿ languages. The result of this attitude is that the Indonesians feel little need to synchronize their language with Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, whereas the Malaysians are keener to coordinate the evolution of the language with the Indonesians.[36] However, both parties have realized that communication benefits from mutually comprehensible and intelligible languages, which motivated efforts to synchronize the languages' development. The effort to synchronize both languages' evolution to increase their mutual intelligibility has been embarked by imposing standard rules of language. This process is headed by Pusat Bahasa[37] on the Indonesian side and Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka as its Malaysian counterpart.\\r\\nThe following texts are excerpts from the official translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Malaysian and Indonesian, along with the original declaration in English.","input":"What is the difference between indonesian and malay?"},{"output":"Hue Jackson","context":"The 2017 Cleveland Browns season was the franchise's 69th season as a professional sports franchise, its 65th season as a member of the National Football League, its second under head coach Hue Jackson and the second and final season under GM Sashi Brown.\\r\\nThe Browns failed to improve upon their 1ÿ15 record from the previous season, losing all sixteen games in 2017 and continuing a losing streak dating to the final game of the previous season.

With that, the Cleveland Browns now hold the longest active postseason drought of any NFL team (as well as the second-longest in all North American professional sport; only the Seattle Mariners, who last made the Major League Baseball playoffs in 2001, have been out of the postseason longer), going back to 2002.\\r\\nWith the loss, the Browns tied their franchise record of 17 straight regular season losses. It also was their 21st consecutive road loss, 17th consecutive loss against a divisional opponent, and 14th consecutive road loss to the Steelers.\\r\\nAlso, Kizer became the first professional QB to go 0-15 in his first 15 starts.[citation needed]\\r\\nA parade was held on January 6, 2018 at FirstEnergy Stadium in honor of the Browns imperfect season and general ineptitude. It was organized by fan Chris McNeil through the contributions of fellow Browns fans and pain reliever manufacturer Excedrin.[49] Additionally, the parade organization raised over $17,000 of charitable donations which went to the Cleveland food bank.[50]","input":"Who is the current coach of the cleveland browns?"},{"output":"South China Mall","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a complete list of the world's largest shopping malls based on their gross leasable area.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n(3,619,677.03 sq ft)[35]\\r\\n\\r\\n(667,000 sq ft)\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.marakez.net/Shopping-Centers/mall-of-arabia#about\\r\\n\\r\\n(1,200,000 sq ft)\\r\\n\\r\\nRiomar RecifeBrazil\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth China MallChina\\r\\n\\r\\nGolden Resources MallChina\\r\\n\\r\\nPersian Gulf ComplexIran\\r\\n\\r\\nSM City North EDSAPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nJamuna Future ParkBangladesh\\r\\n\\r\\nBashundhara CityBangladesh\\r\\n\\r\\nSM MegamallPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nIsfahan City CenterIran\\r\\n\\r\\n1 UtamaMalaysia\\r\\n\\r\\nCentralWorldThailand\\r\\n\\r\\nSM Mall of AsiaPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nintu Metrocentre (Red Mall)United Kingdom\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Century Global CenterChina\\r\\n\\r\\nDream MallTaiwan\\r\\n\\r\\nSiam ParagonThailand\\r\\n\\r\\nSunway PyramidMalaysia\\r\\n\\r\\nFestival AlabangPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nLotte World Tower & Lotte World MallSouth Korea\\r\\n\\r\\nMall Taman AnggrekIndonesia\\r\\n\\r\\nWest Edmonton MallCanada\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dubai MallUnited Arab Emirates\\r\\n\\r\\nBerjaya Times SquareMalaysia\\r\\n\\r\\nCentro MayorColombia\\r\\n\\r\\nMal Artha GadingIndonesia\\r\\n\\r\\nKing of PrussiaUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nSM Aura PremierPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nEmporium MallPakistan\\r\\n\\r\\nLucky One MallPakistan\\r\\n\\r\\nMorocco MallMorocco\\r\\n\\r\\nAventura MallUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nGloriettaPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nGreenbeltPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Coast PlazaUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nCentro Comercial SantafColombia\\r\\n\\r\\nCentro SambilVenezuela\\r\\n\\r\\nCentro Comercial AricanduvaBrazil\\r\\n\\r\\nDel Amo Fashion CenterUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinsons Place ManilaPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nMillcreek MallUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nSuper Brand MallChina\\r\\n\\r\\nMall of the EmiratesUnited Arab Emirates\\r\\n\\r\\nQueensbay MallMalaysia\\r\\n\\r\\nMEGA Family Shopping CentreRussia\\r\\n\\r\\nSawgrass MillsUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nDestiny USAUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nGateway Theatre of ShoppingSouth Africa\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinsons GalleriaPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaza Las AmricasPuerto Rico\\r\\n\\r\\nHouston GalleriaUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nAyala Center CebuPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nTrafford CentreUnited Kingdom\\r\\n\\r\\nSM City Dasmari?asPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nSM SouthmallPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nAla Moana CenterUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nTysons Corner CenterUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nAEON Bukit Tinggi Shopping CentreMalaysia\\r\\n\\r\\nTriNomaPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nShopping City SdAustria\\r\\n\\r\\nSM City FairviewPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nMetroCentreUnited Kingdom\\r\\n\\r\\nSeacon SquareThailand\\r\\n\\r\\nSM City MarikinaPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nSM CDO Downtown PremierPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nWestfield Stratford CityUnited Kingdom\\r\\n\\r\\nCostanera CenterChile\\r\\n\\r\\nSM City BacolodPhilippines\\r\\n\\r\\nMarket!

McGinley on the American television comedy-drama Scrubs. Dr. Cox appeared in every episode except \\"My Last Words,\\" \\"My Comedy Show,\\" and \\"My Full Moon,\\" all in Season 8.\\r\\nMcGinley, Zach Braff, and Donald Faison were the only cast members who returned as regulars for Season 9.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Cox is sarcastic, bitter and has a quick, cruel wit, normally expressed through frequent and sometimes incredibly long rants. At the beginning of the series, he is the chief attending physician at Sacred Heart Hospital; he is later promoted to residency director and, by the eighth season, to chief of medicine. In the ninth and final season, he becomes a professor when Sacred Heart is turned into a medical school. He is the superior and unwilling mentor of the series' protagonist, John \\"J.D.\\" Dorian (Zach Braff). He has a \\"married but not married\\" relationship with his ex-wife, Jordan Sullivan (Christa Miller), with whom he has a son, Jack, and a daughter, Jennifer Dylan. He treats virtually everyone in the hospital with derision, especially his longtime nemesis, Chief of Medicine Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins).\\r\\nCox is athletic, often found playing basketball in the hospital's parking lot with younger employees. In \\"My Friend the Doctor\\", he shows off by slam-dunking a basketball, but injures his back when he lands, a reminder that he is middle-aged. Out of vanity, he tries to hide his injury. He is also extremely egocentric; when named by a magazine as the best doctor in the city, he lines up every staff member beneath him, and his ex-wife, to consecutively praise him.\\r\\nCox grew up in an Irish Catholic family and has a younger sister, Paige (Cheryl Hines). Their family was extremely dysfunctional; their father was an abusive alcoholic, and their mother did nothing to prevent the abuse. Cox has a strained relationship with his sister, who reminds him of the childhood he has tried to forget.[2]\\r\\nIronically, while he goes out of his way to distance himself from others, Cox often gets mixed up in the lives of both his patients and those around him. This personal involvement often manifests in destructive ways, with Cox either internalizing his feelings or externalizing them by targeting those around him. Despite this, he has intervened in some situations, with no expectation of personal gain and often to his own detriment, to help others. A notable example is when he punches Kelso in the face in front of the entire staff when Kelso berates Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke).[3]\\r\\nAccording to McGinley in the Season 1 DVD bonus features, Dr. Cox's habit of often touching his nose is a homage to Paul Newman's character in The Sting, although Cox also uses it as a sign of irritation on occasion, rather than just a sign signifying \\"it's going to be OK\\", as it was used in the film. Dr. Cox has also been compared to Gregory House. This is further explored in \\"My House\\", during which Cox acquires a temporary limp. At the end of the episode, through a series of circumstances, Dr. Cox walks into the room where the other characters are sitting and in a very House-esque way, gives them the answers to everything they have been trying to figure out through the whole episode.\\r\\nCox accepts the position of chief of medicine after Kelso retires.[4] The position, however, does not come easily. He temporarily holds the position until the board finds a replacement, Dr. Taylor Maddox (Courteney Cox). After concluding that Dr. Maddox is, in fact, worse than Kelso, Dr. Cox teams up with the Janitor and Kelso to oust her.[5] After Dr. Maddox is fired, the position is vacant until Dr. Kelso, behind Cox's back, recommends him for the job. Dr. Cox is initially hesitant to take the job out of fear of losing the connection he has with his patients. Although it takes a few days, Kelso convinces him to accept the position.[6]\\r\\nIn the Season 2 DVD commentary of \\"His Story\\", series creator Bill Lawrence stated that one of Dr. Cox's quirks is that he knows if someone is standing behind him and who it is, without turning around to check. This quirk is defied in \\"My Finale\\" when J.D. stands behind Cox as he tells one of the new interns how he really feels; throughout the speech, he gives no sign that he knows that J.D. is behind him.\\r\\nHe is also a very good golfer, regularly besting Kelso.[7]\\r\\nCox harbors an intense hatred for Hugh Jackman, mentioning him frequently in his rants about things he hates throughout the series. According to a 2006 interview with McGinley, Cox's reason for hating Jackman may be that Bill Lawrence envies the actor's talent.[8]\\r\\nCox is occasionally seen wearing a Detroit Red Wings jersey. McGinley is a Red Wings fan and a close friend of former Detroit defenseman Chris Chelios, whose name can be seen on the back of Cox's jersey. He has also been seen wearing a T-shirt for Cheli's Chili Bar, a small chain of restaurants owned by Chelios.\\r\\nCox is a graduate of Hale University and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the former being a fictional adaptation of Yale University.[9]\\r\\nDr. Cox is often seen drinking scotch and has acknowledged (humorously) that he has a drinking problem. Cox drinks so much that J.D. fears that Cox will die of liver disease.[10] After making a mistake about a transplant patient that results in three deaths, a guilt-ridden Cox goes to work drunk and falls into a deep depression.[11] J.D. eventually helps him forgive himself, however.[12] His son Jack's first full sentence is \\"Daddy drinks a lot\\".[12]\\r\\nDr. Cox constantly berates the residents, giving John \\"J.D.\\" Dorian female nicknames (e.g. \\"Tiffany\\", \\"Jennifer\\", \\"Carol\\", \\"Betsy\\", \\"Lindsey\\") and regularly calling him \\"Newbie\\". He also calls Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke) \\"Barbie\\", Turk (Donald Faison) \\"Gandhi\\" and Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins) \\"Bob-O\\", \\"Bobcat\\", and \\"Beelzebob\\". The one person he openly admits to tolerating is head nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes). Throughout Season 1, he and Turk compete for her affections, with Cox eventually bowing out when he sees that Turk and Carla are in love. In one episode, it is seen that Cox helped Turk with how to deal with women when they are mad, Turk eventually taking Perry's advice. Turk soon learns that Carla and Cox went on a date before Turk came to the hospital.[13] Despite his contempt for Turk in early seasons, Cox develops a restrained level of respect for him, and even occasionally gets along with and relates to him. Being reluctant at first, he even appoints Turk as the Chief Surgeon of Sacred Heart. Cox makes this decision after being told by Kelso that his own promotions by Kelso were against the latter's personal disdain for Cox, yet Cox's excellent medical knowledge made him the best candidate nonetheless - a feature that Turk shares with Cox.\\r\\nHe berates Elliot almost as much as J.D., frequently making fun of her insecurity, hairstyle and WASP background. However, he has also been known to stand up for her: he punches Kelso in the face when he yells at her in front of the staff.[3]\\r\\nCox despises Kelso, Sacred Heart's chief of medicine. They disagree constantly about the best way to provide care, with Cox advocating for patients and Kelso adhering to the hospital's bottom line. At one point, he even punches Kelso in the face.[3] On occasion, however, they have acknowledged the necessity of the other's position, and Kelso has admitted that they need each other.[12] When Kelso retires and Cox succeeds him as chief of medicine, Cox confides in him about the pressures of the job, and the two form a \\"secret friendship\\".[14]\\r\\nWhile Dr. Cox has had limited interactions with veteran nurse Laverne Roberts (Aloma Wright), his cynicism drives him to mock her strong religious beliefs on occasion. This culminates in Cox confronting her about a seemingly \\"miraculous\\" accident, unwilling to accept it as divine intervention. Visibly upset, Laverne replies that after 24 years as a nurse, she has to believe in a \\"bigger plan\\", otherwise she'd lose all hope. Taken aback, Cox uncharacteristically apologizes and sincerely replies that he wishes he could also believe that.[15] When she dies in the following episode, he joins the rest of the staff in bidding her farewell and drinking in her honor.[16]\\r\\nHe berates J.D. from their first meeting[17] and emphatically denies being his mentor, despite J.D.'s repeated attempts to win his favor. Nonetheless, Cox has shown concern for J.D.'s welfare, such as telling him not to blame himself for a patient's death[11] and (reluctantly) comforting him when his father dies.[18] He also tells J.D. that he trusts him as a doctor and a person and has taken an interest in him from the start because he seems \\"to actually give a crap\\".[19] Cox also recommends him as a promising, skilled, and hard-working doctor to a review board.[20] In \\"My Finale\\", Cox finally admits that he considers J.D. a talented doctor, a good person, and a friend, although he has to be tricked to do it. He refuses to say this directly to J.D. or to hug him. A flash-forward scene at the end of the episode suggests that Cox will reluctantly be a part of J.D.'s life well into the future.[21]\\r\\nIn the ninth season, Sacred Heart has become a medical school, and Cox is hired as a professor. He immediately begins berating the series' new protagonist, Lucy Johnson (Kerry Bishe), and takes an interest in one of his students, Drew Suffin (Michael Mosley). He calls the latter \\"Number 1\\" and makes him his protg, much to J.D.'s chagrin.[22] However, he still provides advice and support to J.D. (albeit in his usual sarcastic fashion) by telling him that he has to learn to let his students make their own mistakes.[23]\\r\\nCox's family is from Pittsburgh. He has a sister, Paige (Cheryl Hines), who is a born-again Christian.[2] Cox is presented as an ardent skeptic[2] who says that he does not \\"technically believe\\" in God.[24] His political views are varied; he has expressed disdain for members of both political parties, as well as \\"registered Independents\\". He opposes the Iraq War and is disgusted when Elliot reveals that she is a Republican.[25] He also uses \\"Republican\\" as an insult for Paige.[2]\\r\\nCox's father was an abusive alcoholic, and his mother would \\"watch silently while he drunkenly knocked [Dr. Cox and Paige] from room to room.\\" At the end of one episode, he admits to his sister that seeing her reminds him of the childhood he has tried so hard to forget.[2]\\r\\nCox was apparently legally divorced from Jordan Sullivan (Christa Miller Lawrence), but the two have lived together in an exclusive relationship since Jordan discovered she was pregnant.[26] As revealed in flashbacks, the marriage appears to have started out strongly, but went downhill and eventually ended when Jordan slept with Dr. Cox's then-protg Peter Fisher (Jay Mohr).[27] Later in the series, it is revealed that Ted did not submit the divorce papers properly, so Cox and Jordan have been married during the entire run of the show. They immediately resume the role of husband and wife since they have already reconciled, but they quickly become dissatisfied with being an ordinary married couple, so they agree to go back to acting as though they were divorced, even going so far as to actually legally divorce with Ted (again) ending their marriage. In later seasons, Cox quietly resumes wearing his wedding ring, and Jordan soon acquiesces to the marriage title after the birth of their second child, and it is implied that they have remarried.\\r\\nHe has two children with Jordan: a son named Jack and, after an unsuccessful vasectomy, a daughter named Jennifer Dylan (J.D.). Jack is played by Andrew Miller and his twin brother (although in a cameo appearance in \\"My Missed Perception\\", he is played by Bill Lawrence and Christa Miller's son, William). When Jordan first becomes pregnant with Jack, she tells Cox that she was impregnated by a Greek bellboy, wanting Cox to stay because he wants to rather than out of obligation to his child.[26] At first, Cox feels nothing for the then-nameless boy, but begins to feel a connection after the child responds to the name Jack, which Cox had been trying to impress upon him for some time. J.D.'s college friend Spencer (Ryan Reynolds) accidentally tells Cox that he is actually Jack's biological father,[3] and he takes on the role of father much more seriously. Cox has a very unorthodox way of raising Jack, often treating him like his \\"drinking buddy\\". Nonetheless, Cox loves his son and tries fervently to be a better father than his own was. He often talks to Jack in lieu of a therapist. He also dotes on his daughter; among other things, he goes far out of his way to have someone else give her a shot so that she will not associate him with pain.[28]\\r\\nCox is best friends with Jordan's brother, Ben (Brendan Fraser), and is hit hard when he is diagnosed with leukemia; he is initially too afraid to treat him because he fears he will lose him. He rallies, however, and helps Ben go into remission.[29][30] Ben dies in the episode \\"My Screw Up\\", but Cox convinces himself that he is still alive. When he finally admits that Ben is dead, he is devastated, and uncharacteristically allows people to comfort him at the funeral.[31]\\r\\n Quotations related to Perry Cox at Wikiquote","input":"Where did dr cox go to medical school?"},{"output":"the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere","context":"Ocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.[2] Seawater is slightly basic (meaning pH > 7), and ocean acidification involves a shift towards pH-neutral conditions rather than a transition to acidic conditions (pH < 7).[3] An estimated 30ÿ40% of the carbon dioxide from human activity released into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans, rivers and lakes.[4][5] To achieve chemical equilibrium, some of it reacts with the water to form carbonic acid. Some of the resulting carbonic acid molecules dissociate into a bicarbonate ion and a hydrogen ion, thus increasing ocean acidity (H+ ion concentration). Between 1751 and 1996, surface ocean pH is estimated to have decreased from approximately 8.25 to 8.14,[6] representing an increase of almost 35% in H+ ion concentration in the world's oceans.[7][8] Earth System Models project that, within the last decade, ocean acidity exceeded historical analogues[9] and, in combination with other ocean biogeochemical changes, could undermine the functioning of marine ecosystems and disrupt the provision of many goods and services associated with the ocean beginning as early as 2100.[10]\\r\\nIncreasing acidity is thought to have a range of potentially harmful consequences for marine organisms, such as depressing metabolic rates and immune responses in some organisms, and causing coral bleaching.[11] By increasing the presence of free hydrogen ions, the additional carbonic acid that forms in the oceans ultimately results in the conversion of carbonate ions into bicarbonate ions. Ocean alkalinity (roughly equal to [HCO3?] + 2[CO32?]) is not changed by the process, or may increase over long time periods due to carbonate dissolution.[12] This net decrease in the amount of carbonate ions available may make it more difficult for marine calcifying organisms, such as coral and some plankton, to form biogenic calcium carbonate, and such structures become vulnerable to dissolution.[13] Ongoing acidification of the oceans may threaten future food chains connected with the oceans.[14][15] As members of the InterAcademy Panel, 105 science academies have issued a statement on ocean acidification recommending that by 2050, global CO2 emissions be reduced by at least 50% compared to the 1990 level.[16]\\r\\nWhile ongoing ocean acidification is at least partially anthropogenic in origin, it has occurred previously in Earth's history.[17] The most notable example is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM),[18] which occurred approximately 56?million years ago when massive amounts of carbon entered the ocean and atmosphere, and led to the dissolution of carbonate sediments in all ocean basins.\\r\\nOcean acidification has been compared to anthropogenic climate change and called the \\"evil twin of global warming\\"[19][20][21][22][23] and \\"the other CO2 problem\\".[20][22][24] Freshwater bodies also appear to be acidifying, although this is a more complex and less obvious phenomenon.[25][26]\\r\\nThe carbon cycle describes the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO\\r\\n2) between the oceans, terrestrial biosphere, lithosphere,[27] and the atmosphere. Human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels and land use changes have led to a new flux of CO\\r\\n2 into the atmosphere. About 45% has remained in the atmosphere; most of the rest has been taken up by the oceans,[28] with some taken up by terrestrial plants.[29]\\r\\nThe carbon cycle involves both organic compounds such as cellulose and inorganic carbon compounds such as carbon dioxide, carbonate ion, and bicarbonate ion. The inorganic compounds are particularly relevant when discussing ocean acidification for they include many forms of dissolved CO\\r\\n2 present in the Earth's oceans.[31]\\r\\nWhen CO\\r\\n2 dissolves, it reacts with water to form a balance of ionic and non-ionic chemical species: dissolved free carbon dioxide (CO\\r\\n2(aq)), carbonic acid (H\\r\\n2CO\\r\\n3), bicarbonate (HCO?\\r\\n3) and carbonate (CO2?\\r\\n3). The ratio of these species depends on factors such as seawater temperature, pressure, salinity, pH, and alkalinity (as shown in a Bjerrum plot). These different forms of dissolved inorganic carbon are transferred from an ocean's surface to its interior by the ocean's solubility pump.\\r\\nThe resistance of an area of ocean to absorbing atmospheric CO\\r\\n2 is known as the Revelle factor.\\r\\nDissolving CO\\r\\n2 in seawater increases the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration in the ocean, and thus decreases ocean pH, as follows:[32]\\r\\nCaldeira and Wickett (2003)[2] placed the rate and magnitude of modern ocean acidification changes in the context of probable historical changes during the last 300?million years.\\r\\nSince the industrial revolution began, it is estimated that surface ocean pH has dropped by slightly more than 0.1 units on the logarithmic scale of pH, representing about a 29% increase in H+. It is expected to drop by a further 0.3 to 0.5 pH units[10] (an additional doubling to tripling of today's post-industrial acid concentrations) by 2100 as the oceans absorb more anthropogenic CO\\r\\n2, the impacts being most severe for coral reefs and the Southern Ocean.[2][13][33] These changes are predicted to accelerate as more anthropogenic CO\\r\\n2 is released to the atmosphere and taken up by the oceans. The degree of change to ocean chemistry, including ocean pH, will depend on the mitigation and emissions pathways[34] taken by society.[35]\\r\\nAlthough the largest changes are expected in the future,[13] a report from NOAA scientists found large quantities of water undersaturated in aragonite are already upwelling close to the Pacific continental shelf area of North America.[36] Continental shelves play an important role in marine ecosystems since most marine organisms live or are spawned there, and though the study only dealt with the area from Vancouver to Northern California, the authors suggest that other shelf areas may be experiencing similar effects.[36]\\r\\nOne of the first detailed datasets to examine how pH varied over 8 years at a specific north temperate coastal location found that acidification had strong links to in situ?benthic species dynamics and that the variation in ocean pH may cause calcareous species to perform more poorly than noncalcareous species in years with low pH and predicts consequences for near-shore benthic ecosystems.[42][43] Thomas Lovejoy, former chief biodiversity advisor to the World Bank, has suggested that \\"the acidity of the oceans will more than double in the next 40?years. He says this rate is 100 times faster than any changes in ocean acidity in the last 20?million years, making it unlikely that marine life can somehow adapt to the changes.\\"[44] It is predicted that, by the year 2100, If co-occurring biogeochemical changes influence the delivery of ocean goods and services, then they could also have a considerable effect on human welfare. for those who rely heavily on the ocean for food, jobs, and revenues.?.[10][45]\\r\\nCurrent rates of ocean acidification have been compared with the greenhouse event at the PaleoceneÿEocene boundary (about 55?million years ago) when surface ocean temperatures rose by 5ÿ6?degrees Celsius. No catastrophe was seen in surface ecosystems, yet bottom-dwelling organisms in the deep ocean experienced a major extinction. The current acidification is on a path to reach levels higher than any seen in the last 65?million years,[46] and the rate of increase is about ten times the rate that preceded the PaleoceneÿEocene mass extinction. The current and projected acidification has been described as an almost unprecedented geological event.[47] A National Research Council study released in April 2010 likewise concluded that \\"the level of acid in the oceans is increasing at an unprecedented rate\\".[48][49] A 2012 paper in the journal Science examined the geological record in an attempt to find a historical analog for current global conditions as well as those of the future. The researchers determined that the current rate of ocean acidification is faster than at any time in the past 300?million years.[50][51]\\r\\nA review by climate scientists at the RealClimate blog, of a 2005 report by the Royal Society of the UK similarly highlighted the centrality of the rates of change in the present anthropogenic acidification process, writing:[52]\\r\\n\\"The natural pH of the ocean is determined by a need to balance the deposition and burial of CaCO\\r\\n3 on the sea floor against the influx of Ca2+ and CO2?\\r\\n3 into the ocean from dissolving rocks on land, called weathering. These processes stabilize the pH of the ocean, by a mechanism called CaCO\\r\\n3 compensation...The point of bringing it up again is to note that if the CO\\r\\n2 concentration of the atmosphere changes more slowly than this, as it always has throughout the Vostok record, the pH of the ocean will be relatively unaffected because CaCO\\r\\n3 compensation can keep up. The [present] fossil fuel acidification is much faster than natural changes, and so the acid spike will be more intense than the earth has seen in at least 800,000?years.\\"\\r\\nIn the 15-year period 1995ÿ2010 alone, acidity has increased 6 percent in the upper 100?meters of the Pacific Ocean from Hawaii to Alaska.[53] According to a statement in July 2012 by Jane Lubchenco, head of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \\"surface waters are changing much more rapidly than initial calculations have suggested. It's yet another reason to be very seriously concerned about the amount of carbon dioxide that is in the atmosphere now and the additional amount we continue to put out.\\"[19]\\r\\nA 2013 study claimed acidity was increasing at a rate 10 times faster than in any of the evolutionary crises in Earth's history.[54] In a synthesis report published in Science in 2015, 22 leading marine scientists stated that CO2 from burning fossil fuels is changing the oceans' chemistry more rapidly than at any time since the Great Dying, Earth's most severe known extinction event, emphasizing that the 2?C maximum temperature increase agreed upon by governments reflects too small a cut in emissions to prevent \\"dramatic impacts\\" on the world's oceans, with lead author Jean-Pierre Gattuso remarking that \\"The ocean has been minimally considered at previous climate negotiations. Our study provides compelling arguments for a radical change at the UN conference (in Paris) on climate change\\".[55]\\r\\nThe rate at which ocean acidification will occur may be influenced by the rate of surface ocean warming, because the chemical equilibria that govern seawater pH are temperature-dependent.[56] Greater seawater warming could lead to a smaller change in pH for a given increase in CO2.[56]\\r\\nChanges in ocean chemistry can have extensive direct and indirect effects on organisms and their habitats. One of the most important repercussions of increasing ocean acidity relates to the production of shells and plates out of calcium carbonate (CaCO\\r\\n3).[33] This process is called calcification and is important to the biology and survival of a wide range of marine organisms. Calcification involves the precipitation of dissolved ions into solid CaCO\\r\\n3 structures, such as coccoliths. After they are formed, such structures are vulnerable to dissolution unless the surrounding seawater contains saturating concentrations of carbonate ions (CO32?).\\r\\nOf the extra carbon dioxide added into the oceans, some remains as dissolved carbon dioxide, while the rest contributes towards making additional bicarbonate (and additional carbonic acid). This also increases the concentration of hydrogen ions, and the percentage increase in hydrogen is larger than the percentage increase in bicarbonate,[57] creating an imbalance in the reaction HCO3? \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\leftrightarrow }\\r\\n\\r\\n CO32? + H+. To maintain chemical equilibrium, some of the carbonate ions already in the ocean combine with some of the hydrogen ions to make further bicarbonate. Thus the ocean's concentration of carbonate ions is reduced, creating an imbalance in the reaction Ca2+ + CO32? \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\leftrightarrow }\\r\\n\\r\\n CaCO3, and making the dissolution of formed CaCO\\r\\n3 structures more likely.\\r\\nThese increases in concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide and bicarbonate, and reduction in carbonate, are shown in a Bjerrum plot.\\r\\nThe saturation state (known as ) of seawater for a mineral is a measure of the thermodynamic potential for the mineral to form or to dissolve, and for calcium carbonate is described by the following equation:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCa\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n+\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCO\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nK\\r\\n\\r\\ns\\r\\np\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\Omega }={\\\\frac {\\\\left[{\\\\textrm {Ca}}^{2+}\\\\right]\\\\left[{\\\\textrm {CO}}_{3}^{2-}\\\\right]}{K_{sp}}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere  is the product of the concentrations (or activities) of the reacting ions that form the mineral (Ca2+ and CO2?\\r\\n3), divided by the product of the concentrations of those ions when the mineral is at equilibrium (K\\r\\nsp), that is, when the mineral is neither forming nor dissolving.[58] In seawater, a natural horizontal boundary is formed as a result of temperature, pressure, and depth, and is known as the saturation horizon.[33] Above this saturation horizon,  has a value greater than 1, and CaCO\\r\\n3 does not readily dissolve. Most calcifying organisms live in such waters.[33] Below this depth,  has a value less than 1, and CaCO\\r\\n3 will dissolve. However, if its production rate is high enough to offset dissolution, CaCO\\r\\n3 can still occur where  is less than 1. The carbonate compensation depth occurs at the depth in the ocean where production is exceeded by dissolution.[59]\\r\\nThe decrease in the concentration of CO32? decreases , and hence makes CaCO\\r\\n3 dissolution more likely.\\r\\nCalcium carbonate occurs in two common polymorphs (crystalline forms): aragonite and calcite. Aragonite is much more soluble than calcite, so the aragonite saturation horizon is always nearer to the surface than the calcite saturation horizon.[33] This also means that those organisms that produce aragonite may be more vulnerable to changes in ocean acidity than those that produce calcite.[13] Increasing CO\\r\\n2 levels and the resulting lower pH of seawater decreases the saturation state of CaCO\\r\\n3 and raises the saturation horizons of both forms closer to the surface.[60] This decrease in saturation state is believed to be one of the main factors leading to decreased calcification in marine organisms, as the inorganic precipitation of CaCO\\r\\n3 is directly proportional to its saturation state.[61]\\r\\nIncreasing acidity has possibly harmful consequences, such as depressing metabolic rates in jumbo squid,[62] depressing the immune responses of blue mussels,[63] and coral bleaching. However it may benefit some species, for example increasing the growth rate of the sea star, Pisaster ochraceus,[64] while shelled plankton species may flourish in altered oceans.[65]\\r\\nThe report \\"Ocean Acidification Summary for Policymakers 2013\\" describes research findings and possible impacts.[66]\\r\\nAlthough the natural absorption of CO\\r\\n2 by the world's oceans helps mitigate the climatic effects of anthropogenic emissions of CO\\r\\n2, it is believed that the resulting decrease in pH will have negative consequences, primarily for oceanic calcifying organisms. These span the food chain from autotrophs to heterotrophs and include organisms such as coccolithophores, corals, foraminifera, echinoderms, crustaceans and molluscs.[10][67] As described above, under normal conditions, calcite and aragonite are stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at supersaturating concentrations. However, as ocean pH falls, the concentration of carbonate ions required for saturation to occur increases, and when carbonate becomes undersaturated, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution. Therefore, even if there is no change in the rate of calcification, the rate of dissolution of calcareous material increases.[68]\\r\\nCorals,[69][70][71] coccolithophore algae,[72][73][74][75] coralline algae,[76] foraminifera,[77] shellfish[78] and pteropods[13][79] experience reduced calcification or enhanced dissolution when exposed to elevated CO\\r\\n2.\\r\\nThe Royal Society published a comprehensive overview of ocean acidification, and its potential consequences, in June 2005.[33] However, some studies have found different response to ocean acidification, with coccolithophore calcification and photosynthesis both increasing under elevated atmospheric pCO2,[80][81][82] an equal decline in primary production and calcification in response to elevated CO2[83] or the direction of the response varying between species.[84] A study in 2008 examining a sediment core from the North Atlantic found that while the species composition of coccolithophorids has remained unchanged for the industrial period 1780 to 2004, the calcification of coccoliths has increased by up to 40% during the same time.[82] A 2010 study from Stony Brook University suggested that while some areas are overharvested and other fishing grounds are being restored, because of ocean acidification it may be impossible to bring back many previous shellfish populations.[85] While the full ecological consequences of these changes in calcification are still uncertain, it appears likely that many calcifying species will be adversely affected.\\r\\nWhen exposed in experiments to pH reduced by 0.2 to 0.4, larvae of a temperate brittlestar, a relative of the common sea star, fewer than 0.1 percent survived more than eight days.[53] There is also a suggestion that a decline in the coccolithophores may have secondary effects on climate, contributing to global warming by decreasing the Earth's albedo via their effects on oceanic cloud cover.[86] All marine ecosystems on Earth will be exposed to changes in acidification and several other ocean biogeochemical changes.[10]\\r\\nThe fluid in the internal compartments where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater is lower than the ambient level, the corals have to work harder to maintain the right balance in the internal compartment. When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. Depending on how much aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite are too low to pump into the internal compartment. They could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water.[87]\\r\\nOcean acidification may force some organisms to reallocate resources away from productive endpoints such as growth in order to maintain calcification.[88]\\r\\nIn some places carbon dioxide bubbles out from the sea floor, locally changing the pH and other aspects of the chemistry of the seawater. Studies of these carbon dioxide seeps have documented a variety of responses by different organisms.[7] Coral reef communities located near carbon dioxide seeps are of particular interest because of the sensitivity of some corals species to acidification. In Papua New Guinea, declining pH caused by carbon dioxide seeps is associated with declines in coral species diversity.[89] However, in Palau carbon dioxide seeps are not associated with reduced species diversity of corals, although bioerosion of coral skeletons is much higher at low pH sites.\\r\\nAside from the slowing and/or reversing of calcification, organisms may suffer other adverse effects, either indirectly through negative impacts on food resources,[33] or directly as reproductive or physiological effects. For example, the elevated oceanic levels of CO2 may produce CO\\r\\n2-induced acidification of body fluids, known as hypercapnia. Also, increasing ocean acidity is believed to have a range of direct consequences. For example, increasing acidity has been observed to: reduce metabolic rates in jumbo squid;[62] depress the immune responses of blue mussels;[63] and make it harder for juvenile clownfish to tell apart the smells of non-predators and predators,[90] or hear the sounds of their predators.[91] This is possibly because ocean acidification may alter the acoustic properties of seawater, allowing sound to propagate further, and increasing ocean noise.[92] This impacts all animals that use sound for echolocation or communication.[93] Atlantic longfin squid eggs took longer to hatch in acidified water, and the squid's statolith was smaller and malformed in animals placed in sea water with a lower pH. The lower PH was simulated with 20-30 times the normal amount of CO2.[94] However, as with calcification, as yet there is not a full understanding of these processes in marine organisms or ecosystems.[95]\\r\\nAnother possible effect would be an increase in red tide events, which could contribute to the accumulation of toxins (domoic acid, brevetoxin, saxitoxin) in small organisms such as anchovies and shellfish, in turn increasing occurrences of amnesic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning and paralytic shellfish poisoning.[96]\\r\\nWhile the full implications of elevated CO2 on marine ecosystems are still being documented, there is a substantial body of research showing that a combination of ocean acidification and elevated ocean temperature, driven mainly by CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, have a compounded effect on marine life and the ocean environment. This effect far exceeds the individual harmful impact of either.[97][98][99] In addition, ocean warming exacerbates ocean deoxygenation, which is an additional stressor on marine organisms, by increasing ocean stratification, through density and solubility effects, thus limiting nutrients,[100][101] while at the same time increasing metabolic demand.\\r\\nMeta analyses have quantified the direction and magnitude of the harmful effects of ocean acidification, warming and deoxygenation on the ocean.[102][103][104] These meta-analyses have been further tested by mesocosm studies[105][106] that simulated the interaction of these stressors and found a catastrophic effect on the marine food web, i.e. that the increases in consumption from thermal stress more than negates any primary producer to herbivore increase from elevated CO2.\\r\\nLeaving aside direct biological effects, it is expected that ocean acidification in the future will lead to a significant decrease in the burial of carbonate sediments for several centuries, and even the dissolution of existing carbonate sediments.[107] This will cause an elevation of ocean alkalinity, leading to the enhancement of the ocean as a reservoir for CO2 with implications for climate change as more CO2 leaves the atmosphere for the ocean.[108]\\r\\nThe threat of acidification includes a decline in commercial fisheries and in the Arctic tourism industry and economy. Commercial fisheries are threatened because acidification harms calcifying organisms which form the base of the Arctic food webs.\\r\\nPteropods and brittle stars both form the base of the Arctic food webs and are both seriously damaged from acidification. Pteropods shells dissolve with increasing acidification and the brittle stars lose muscle mass when re-growing appendages.[109] For pteropods to create shells they require aragonite which is produced through carbonate ions and dissolved calcium. Pteropods are severely affected because increasing acidification levels have steadily decreased the amount of water supersaturated with carbonate which is needed for aragonite creation.[110] Arctic waters are changing so rapidly that they will become undersaturated with aragonite as early as 2016.[110] Additionally the brittle star's eggs die within a few days when exposed to expected conditions resulting from Arctic acidification.[111] Acidification threatens to destroy Arctic food webs from the base up. Arctic food webs are considered simple, meaning there are few steps in the food chain from small organisms to larger predators. For example, pteropods are \\"a key prey item of a number of higher predators ÿ larger plankton, fish, seabirds, whales\\".[112] Both pteropods and sea stars serve as a substantial food source and their removal from the simple food web would pose a serious threat to the whole ecosystem. The effects on the calcifying organisms at the base of the food webs could potentially destroy fisheries. The value of fish caught from US commercial fisheries in 2007 was valued at $3.8?billion and of that 73% was derived from calcifiers and their direct predators.[113] Other organisms are directly harmed as a result of acidification. For example, decrease in the growth of marine calcifiers such as the American lobster, ocean quahog, and scallops means there is less shellfish meat available for sale and consumption.[114] Red king crab fisheries are also at a serious threat because crabs are calcifiers and rely on carbonate ions for shell development. Baby red king crab when exposed to increased acidification levels experienced 100% mortality after 95?days.[115] In 2006 red king cab accounted for 23% of the total guideline harvest levels and a serious decline in red crab population would threaten the crab harvesting industry.[116] Several ocean goods and services are likely to be undermined by future ocean acidification potentially affecting the livelihoods of some 400 to 800?million people depending upon the emission scenario.[10]\\r\\nAcidification could damage the Arctic tourism economy and affect the way of life of indigenous peoples. A major pillar of Arctic tourism is the sport fishing and hunting industry. The sport fishing industry is threatened by collapsing food webs which provide food for the prized fish. A decline in tourism lowers revenue input in the area, and threatens the economies that are increasingly dependent on tourism.[117] The rapid decrease or disappearance of marine life could also affect the diet of Indigenous peoples.\\r\\nMembers of the InterAcademy Panel recommended that by 2050, global anthropogenic CO2 emissions be reduced less than 50% of the 1990 level.[16] The 2009[16] statement also called on world leaders to:\\r\\nStabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 450 ppm would require near-term emissions reductions, with steeper reductions over time.[118]\\r\\nThe German Advisory Council on Global Change[119] stated:\\r\\nIn order to prevent disruption of the calcification of marine organisms and the resultant risk of fundamentally altering marine food webs, the following guard rail should be obeyed: the pH of near surface waters should not drop more than 0.2 units below the pre-industrial average value in any larger ocean region (nor in the global mean).\\r\\nOne policy target related to ocean acidity is the magnitude of future global warming. Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) adopted a target of limiting warming to below 2?C, relative to the pre-industrial level.[120] Meeting this target would require substantial reductions in anthropogenic CO2 emissions.[121]\\r\\nLimiting global warming to below 2?C would imply a reduction in surface ocean pH of 0.16 from pre-industrial levels. This would represent a substantial decline in surface ocean pH.[122]\\r\\nOn September 25, 2015, USEPA denied[123] a June 30, 2015, citizens petition[124] that asked EPA to regulate CO2 under TSCA in order to mitigate ocean acidification. In the denial, EPA said that risks from ocean acidification were being \\"more efficiently and effectively addressed\\" under domestic actions, e.g., under the Presidential Climate Action Plan,[125] and that multiple avenues are being pursued to work with and in other nations to reduce emissions and deforestation and promote clean energy and energy efficiency.\\r\\nOn March 28, 2017 the US by executive order rescinded the Climate Action Plan.[126] On June 1, 2017 it was announced the US would withdraw from the Paris accords,[127] and on June 12, 2017 that the US would abstain from the G7 Climate Change Pledge,[128] two major international efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.\\r\\nClimate engineering (mitigating temperature or pH effects of emissions) has been proposed as a possible response to ocean acidification. The IAP (2009)[16] statement cautioned against climate engineering as a policy response:\\r\\nMitigation approaches such as adding chemicals to counter the effects of acidification are likely to be expensive, only partly effective and only at a very local scale, and may pose additional unanticipated risks to the marine environment. There has been very little research on the feasibility and impacts of these approaches. Substantial research is needed before these techniques could be applied.\\r\\nReports by the WGBU (2006),[119] the UK's Royal Society (2009),[129] and the US National Research Council (2011)[130] warned of the potential risks and difficulties associated with climate engineering.\\r\\nIron fertilization of the ocean could stimulate photosynthesis in phytoplankton (see Iron hypothesis). The phytoplankton would convert the ocean's dissolved carbon dioxide into carbohydrate and oxygen gas, some of which would sink into the deeper ocean before oxidizing. More than a dozen open-sea experiments confirmed that adding iron to the ocean increases photosynthesis in phytoplankton by up to 30 times.[131] While this approach has been proposed as a potential solution to the ocean acidification problem, mitigation of surface ocean acidification might increase acidification in the less-inhabited deep ocean.[132]\\r\\nA report by the UK's Royal Society (2009)[133] reviewed the approach for effectiveness, affordability, timeliness and safety. The rating for affordability was \\"medium\\", or \\"not expected to be very cost-effective\\". For the other three criteria, the ratings ranged from \\"low\\" to \\"very low\\" (i.e., not good). For example, in regards to safety, the report found a \\"[high] potential for undesirable ecological side effects\\", and that ocean fertilization \\"may increase anoxic regions of ocean ('dead zones')\\".[134]\\r\\n\\"Present day\\" (1990s) sea surface pH\\r\\nPresent day alkalinity\\r\\n\\"Present day\\" (1990s) sea surface anthropogenic CO\\r\\n2\\r\\nVertical inventory of \\"present day\\" (1990s) anthropogenic CO\\r\\n2\\r\\nChange in surface CO2?\\r\\n3 ion from the 1700s to the 1990s\\r\\nPresent day DIC\\r\\nPre-Industrial DIC\\r\\nA NOAA (AOML) in situ CO\\r\\n2 concentration sensor (SAMI-CO2), attached to a Coral Reef Early Warning System station, utilized in conducting ocean acidification studies near coral reef areas\\r\\nA NOAA (PMEL) moored autonomous CO\\r\\n2 buoy used for measuring CO\\r\\n2 concentration and ocean acidification studies","input":"What is causing the oceans to become more acidic?"},{"output":"to stem the flow of merchant shipping that enabled Britain to keep fighting","context":"","input":"What was germany's main goal in the battle of the atlantic?"},{"output":"glorification of the religious beliefs and lives","context":"Genres\\r\\nInstitutions\\r\\nAwards\\r\\nBengali novels occupy a major part of Bengali literature. Though the first Bengali novel was Karuna O Phulmonir Bibaran (1852), the Bengali novel actually started its journey with Durgeshnandini written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in 1865. According to Ananda Sanker and Lila Ray, 'when the novel was introduced in Bengali in the middle of the 19th century, the form itself was new, the prose in which it was written was new, the secular tone was new in a country hitherto wholly dominated by religion, and the society in which and for which it was written was new (Page 168). But some great novelists like Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Rabindranath Tagore, Manik Bandopadhyay, Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay developed the newly introduced genre in such a way that new changed into matured through their works. Almost all these literary activities went on in full swing in Kolkata. Dhaka, on the other hand, could not participate in the early stage but literature created by and of the people of Bangladesh area later on flourished with notable success.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNovels of Bangladesh fall almost fifty years behind the Bengali novels. (First Bengali novel Alaler Ghore Dulal was published in 1858 and Anowara was published in 1914.) In its history of about one hundred years, novels of Bangladesh got a good number of novels where creative emancipation of the writers has been established.\\r\\nIn the early stage, glorification of the religious beliefs and lives was the theme of most of the novels. Later on, picturization of real Bengali life became a common topic. By the end of the fifties, the novelists gradually turned to human mind and its analysis. A great change of the theme came after 1971. Novels about the Liberation War of Bangladesh began to come forth. Even till now it has not ceased to be an interesting topic.\\r\\nThe content and form of the novels saw various changes in the last fifty years. Starting from ordinary narration, now it has reached to magic realistic presentation through stream of consciousness, realism, surrealism etc.\\r\\nTo many, Anowara was the most significant one among the earlier novels written in Bangladesh. This novel was written by Mohammad Najibar Rahman in 1914. But the milestone in the modern novels of Bangladesh is Syed Waliullah's Lalsalu (published in 1948). The history of Bangladeshi novels can be categorized in 3 major parts.\\r\\nBefore 1947, events like Partition of Bengal in 1905, Foundation of Muslim League in 1906 and Unification of Bengali in 1911 inspired the Muslim community of Dhaka to establish a new identity in the horizon of literature. Mohammad Najibar Rahman, Kazi Imdadul Huq, Kazi Abdul Wadud, Sheikh Idrish Ali, Akbaruddin, Abul Fazal, Humayun Kabir etc. were among the novelists who tried to enrich the novels of the then East Pakistan, present Bangladesh.\\r\\nMohammad Najibar Rahman's Anowara was the first notable novel and it moved the whole Bengali Muslim community after publication. According to Rafiqullah Khan, The novel could not create any novelty from artistic point of view, but it carried great importance for its picturization of socio-economic and political culture and ideals of the uprising populace (Page 25, Translation). The main themes of most of the novels in this era were Muslim society, beliefs, and orthodoxy. Examples of novels incorporating these themes are Najibar Rahman's Premer Somadhi (published in 1919) and Goriber Meye (1923), Sheikh Idris Ali's Premer Pothe (1926). In this time, for the first time the life of the Bengali farmers took an artistic delineation through Kazi Abdul Wadud's Nodibakshe (1919).\\r\\nThen Kazi Imdadul Huq sprinkled a new wave. His famous novel Abdullah was published in periodicals in 1920 and it came into book form in 1933. According to Biswajit Ghosh, this novel was a 'bourgeois and humanitarian revolt against devotion to Peers, religious dogmas, purdah-system and disparity between Ashraf and Atraf'.[1] Later, 'Kazi Abdul Wadud and Humayun Kabir extended this attitude'.[2] Another novelist, Abul Fazal, exposed human psychological analyses in his novel Chouchir (1927). He afterwards continued with his own style and wrote Prodip O Patongo (1940) and Shahoshika (1946). It is well accepted that this type of psychological approach was a first attempt in novels of Bangladesh, though not for the first time in Bengali novels.\\r\\nA progressive novelist Humayun Kabir wrote an English novel, Rivers and Women, which was published in 1945. The Bengali form was published in 1952 by the name of Nodi O Nari.\\r\\nThe independence of India and Pakistan from British rule bore more importance for the people of then Bengal. Since then the Bengali speaking community were divided into two parts ÿ the East and the West Bengal. It turns into the smashing of the millennium-old culture and unity of Bengali nation. Moreover, the existence of language became a great question just after the creation of Pakistan. The West-Pakistan ruling government tried to impose Urdu as the principal language on the Bengali people. But the whole society reacted strongly. This leaves a permanent impression on Bengali literature. In this tumultuous era, Syed Waliullah's Lalsalu (1948) was published. It was the foremost successful novel, both from art and reality points of view. Later Syed Waliullah translated it in English by the name Tree Without Roots. Mahbub-ul Alam wrote Mofijon, also published in 1948.\\r\\nIn the first years of the Pakistan regime the authors mostly took village life as their theme, but they gradually diversified their interests. Newly born urban society began to establish itself as worthy to be literary contents. Along with them political developments also took place in fiction. Among the first novelists of Pakistan period, Abul Fazal, Akbar Hossain, Shaukat Osman, Abu Rushd, Kazi Afsaruddin, Daulatunnessa Khatun, Syed Waliullah, Sarder Jayenuddin, Abu Ishaque, and Shamsuddin Abul Kalam were the most prominent ones.\\r\\nThen came a whole generation of extraordinary novelists. Chowdhury Shamsur Rahman, Satyen Sen, Abujafar Shamsuddin, Ahsan Habib, Nilima Ibrahim, Abdur Razzak, Khondkar Md. Eliash, Rashid Karim, Shahidulla Kaisar, Anwar Pasha, Abdar Rashid, Alauddin Al-Azad, Abdul Gaffar Choudhury, Zahir Raihan, Syed Shamsul Haq, Humayun Kadir, Shahid Akhand, Razia Khan, Shawkat Ali, Dilara Hashim, Indu Saha, Ahmed Sofa were notable names.\\r\\nIn this time diversity of contents of the novel was noticeable. Village life was the core theme of a huge number of novels. Sometimes it centered the superstitious village mind or the oppression by the influential groups on the common people, some other times depressed womanhood took this place. Love between men and women in pastoral context were also a subject of many novels. Lalshalu by Syed Waliullah, Kashboner Konna by Shamsuddin Abul Kalam, Surjo Dighol Bari by Abu Ishaque, Meghabaran Kesh by Ishaq Chakhari, Adiganta by Sardar Jayenunddin, Mohuar Desh by Tasadduk Hossain, Janani by Shaukat Osman, Jhar by Syed Sahadat Hossain, Karnafully by Alauddin Al-Azad, Sareng Bou and Sangsaptak by Shahidulla Kaisar, Aranya Mithun by Badruddin Ahmad, Modhumoti by Rabeya Khatun, Hazar Bachhar Dhore by Zahir Raihan, Bobakahini by Jasimuddin, Pannamoti by Sardar Jayenuddin etc. incorporated these themes.\\r\\nMiddle class society began to evolve in this time. Urban life, its problems and complexities, uprising middle-class people, their social context and love in their life started to be portrayed in a good number of novels. Jibon Pother Jatri by Abul Fazal, Pother Porosh (1957) by Daulatunnessa Khatun, Bhorer Bihongi (1958) by Satyen Sen, Surjer Niche (1958) by Atahar Ahmad, Pathasranta (1959) by Nilima Ibrahim, Shesh Bikeler Meye (1960) by Zahir Raihan, Kanyakumari (1960) by Abdur Razzak, Uttam Purush (1961) by Rashid Karim, Ek Path Dui Bank (1962) by Nilima Ibrahim, Akash Jodi Nil Hoi (1962) and Ihai To Prem (1963) by Syed Sahadat Hossain, Prasanno Pashan (1963) by Rashid Karim, Pingal Aakash (1963) by Shawkat Ali, Akasher Rong (1964) by Zobeda Khanam, Panna Holo Sobuz (1964) by Shahid Akhand, Nirjan Megh (1965) by Humayun Kadir, Ghar Mon Janala (1965) by Dilara Hashim, Aronyo Nilima (1965) by Ahsan Habib, Antahshila (1967) by Kazi Md. Idris, Digonter Swapno (1967) by Razia Majid, Mon Ek Shet Kopoti (1967), Shaheb Bazar (1967) and Ananto Aneysha (1967) by Rabeya Khatun, Bipani Mon (1968) by Mir Abul Hossain, Sourav (1968) by Anis Chowdhury, Anishchita Ragini (1969) by Abu Rushd, Borof Gola Nodi (1969) by Zahir Raihan, Rajabagh Shahimar Bagh (1969) by Rabeya Khatun etc. are significant novels of this stream.\\r\\nBut the background of another major event was being prepared in this time. The country began to experience turmoil. The political situation of the country became more and more prominent in the novels also. In novels like Nongor by Abu Rushd and Mon Na Moti by Anis Siddique, Jibon Khuda by Abul Monsoor Ahmed exposed the context of Pakistan Movement. Communal picture out of this movement and the restoration of Hindu-Muslim harmony also became core content in a number of novels including Ranga Probhat by Abul Fazal, Khuda O Asha by Alauddin Al-Azad, Neer Sandhani and Nishuti Rater Gatha by Anwar Pasha etc.\\r\\nThen came the historic event of the Bengali Language Movement. The keen eyes of the novelists were nowhere but on this tremendous incident. Jahir Raihan's Aarek Falgoon was the most significant effort on language movement. Other political incidents like the class conflict, socialism, and movement in the cultivators was depicted in the novels like Dui Mohol (later on renamed as Alamnagorer Upokotha) by Shamsuddin Abul Kalam, Surjo Tumi Sathi by Ahmad Sofa etc. Shaukat Osman wrote wonderful symbolic political novels Kritodasher Hashi and Raja Upakhyan. Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury's Chandradwiper Upakhyan and Nam Na Jana Bhore portrayed the uprising farmer society and its conflicts.\\r\\nThere were some historical novels also. Abujafar Shamsuddin's Bhaowal Gorer Upakhayan about the Faraizi Movement, Sardar Jayenuddin's Nil Rong Rokto about the Indigo revolt, Satyen Sen's Kumarajiva about the spread of Buddhism, and Oporajeyo about the Sepoy Revolt etc. are a few examples among them. Some novelists favoured psychological complexities. With his unique presentation and language of his own, Syed Waliullah wrote Chander Amabashya and Kando Nodi Kando keeping psychological analysis in the centre.\\r\\nAnother trend of novels having emphasis on the sexual behaviours and deviations of the characters began to mark its own place during the sixties. Razia Khan's Bot-tolar Uponyas, and Anukolpo was among the first novels of this trend. Alauddin Al-Azad's Teish Nambor Toilochitro, Shiter Sheshrat Boshonter Prothomdin and Syed Shamsul Haq's Ek Mohilar Chhobi, Anupama Din, Simana Chhariye etc. are mentionables in this regard.\\r\\nAfterwards came the most memorable days of Bangali nation. After ten month long war Bangalis became independent nation. After the massacre of three million people and huge violation and harassment of womenfolk and loss of property Bangladesh emerged as a secular and democratic nation on 16 December 1971, and Bangladeshi novel enters into a new era.\\r\\nMost of the writers who were contributing in the pre-liberation period were also very creative in this period. Rashid Karim wrote novels based on middle-class society and their societal and psychological analysis. Alauddin Al-Azad, Shawkat Ali, Razia Khan and Dilara Hashim, Mahmudul Haque, Ahmad Sofa, Syed Shamsul Haq is among other notable names. Syed Shamsul Haq, commonly known as Syed Huq, wrote a good number of novels along with a huge number of books of other genres. He is always very experimental in both technique and form. Khelaram Khele Ja placed him in great controversy for his open delineation of human sexual behaviour. In his novels like Duratto, Mahashunye Poran Master, Ek Juboker Chhayapoth etc. Liberation war, its consequences, hopeless human existence and analysis of human mind and society take sharp pen-picture. Another powerful writer Shawkat Ali wrote Prodoshe Praakritojon, which is a real representation of the twelfth century Bengali during King Lakhkhan Sen. His trilogy Dakshinayaner Din, Kulaya Kalasrot and Purbaratri Purbadin deserve much compliment. Mahmudul Haque wrote Anur Pathshala before liberation war in 1967. He wrote Nirapod Tondra, Khelaghar (written 1978, published 1988), Kalo Borof (written in 1977, published in 1992), and Matir Jahaj (written in 1977, published in 1996). Ahmad Sofa, wrote novels with different tone. In Onkar (1975) he portrayed the suppressed Bangali mind of the pre-liberation period in a very artistic and symbolic way. In Gaavi Brityanto he presents the contemporary picture in a meticulous allegory. Ardhek Nari Ardhek Ishwari, a novel of romantic love, is widely considered as his masterpiece. His Pushpa Brikhkha Ebong Bihongo Puran is a narration of true human affinity to nature.\\r\\nAfter the liberation war, freedom fight became a unique subject. The first of this discipline is Anwar Pasha's Rifle Roti Awrat that he wrote during the war. Shaukat Osman's Jahannam Hoite Bidai, Nekre Aranyo, Dui Soinik, Rashid Haider's Khanchai, Andho Kothamala, Shawkat Ali's Jatraa, Selina Hossain's Hangor Nodi Granade, Mahmudul Huq's Jiban Aamar Bone, Syed Shamsul Haq's Nil Dangshon, Nishiddho Loban, Harun Habib's Priyo Joddha Priyotoma, Humayun Ahmed's Jochona O Jononir Golpo etc. are examples of novels which directly deal freedom fight as their subject. Besides this, novels like Amar Jato Glani by Rashid Karim, Ferari Surjo by Rabeya Khatun, Abelay Ashamoy by Amjad Hossain also portray the different facets of liberation war. Rashid Karim's Prem Ekti Lal Golap, Ekaler Rupkotha or Sadharon Loker Kahini are presentation of the hopeless picture of Bangladesh after the war. 'Critics say that though after the liberation huge number of novels was written about our war, none of them could depict the historic incident in necessary epic form'.\\r\\nNew faces appeared in the literary world after the liberation. Among them Selina Hossain, Humayun Ahmed, Hasnat Abdul Hye, Rizia Rahman, Jubaida Gulshan Ara Hena, Bashir al-Helal were the most prominent.\\r\\nSelina Hossain started with Jalochchhwas and till now she has authored more than twenty-one novels. Her Hangor Nodi Granade is a success written on Bangladesh Liberation War. She has written novels like Taanaporen on coastal life and natural disaster. Gayatree Sondhya (3 volumes: published in, 1994, 1995, 1996), Kalketu O Fullora, Chandbene are some of her historical novels.\\r\\nAbdur Rouf Choudhury's novel Natun Diganta (three volumes: published in 1991, 1992, 1993 and complete collection in 2005 by Pathak Shamabesh) is a quality work of art by any standard and most successful writing on pre- Bangladesh Liberation War. Choudhury most vividly depicted the unity of Bengal and the articulation of Bengali nationalism in his novel Natun Diganta (New Horizon) (vols. 1-3). Reason and humanity ÿ these are its two eternal pillars. The essence of Choudhury's thought is a complete faith in the efficiency of these two immeasurable forces. Its most striking characteristic is its insistent association of work, precept and practice. It appeals not to controversial tests, not to any appearance of sweet reasonableness but to trials in the rough and tumble of life, and it will accept no other judgment. Natun Diganta gives warning against: 1) dogma, mysticism, ceremonial, hypnotism, the binding of the mind and will by oaths, and other inventions of external authority in religion and politics, 2) participation in violence, individual or social, and organisation's dependence on violence, 3) exploitation, luxury and material property, 4) self-degradation and 5) devotion to self-sacrifice.\\r\\nHumayun Ahmed, perhaps the most popular novelist in Bengali after Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, appeared with his novel Nondito Noroke and then Shonkhoneel Karagar. Later he gradually turned to less serious things. Almost all of his novels are best sellers. Some of his titles are 1971, Daruchinir Deep, Brihonnola, Joyjoyonti, Kobi etc. Humayun Ahmed's Tomader Jonno Valobasa is the first science fiction novel in Bangladesh.\\r\\nA serious poet, essayist and literary researcher Abdul Mannan Syed published his first novel Pariprekshter Dasdashi in 1974. Later on he wrote Kolkata, Poramatir Kaaj, O Te Ojogor, Hei Songsar Hei Lota, Khudha, Prem, Aagun, Shyamoli Tomar Mukh etc. Hasnat Abdul Hye, arrived with his Suprobhat Bhalobasa. By now he has written at least twenty novels. Along with his other novels he has introduced a different form of novels called biographical. Sultan, Ekjon Aaroj Ali and Novera are example of this form. All of these novels are based on the biographical sketches of giant Bangali characters. Rizia Rahman's Uttar Purush came in black and white in 1977. She wrote some fifteen novels in the eighties. Her voluminous Bongo Theke Bangla is an epic composition about the past culture and heritage of Bangali nation. Her other major novels are Rokter Okhkhor, Alikhito Upakhyan, Ekal Chirokal, Prem Aamar Prem, Ekti Phuler Jonyo, Harun Fereni etc. Bashir al-Helal's Kalo Elish was published in 1979. His other novels include Ghritokumari, Shesh Panpatro, Nurjahander Modhumas etc.\\r\\nIn the eighties, Bangladeshi novel got some senior writers who wrote novels for the first time along with some promising young ones. Among the earlier writers Abubakar Siddique's Jalarakshas and Kharadaha appeared with much novelty. His important later novel is Ekatturer Hridoybhashma. Makbula Manjoor started in the late years of the sixties, but most of her novels came out in the eighties and nineties. Kaler Mondira is one of her most notable work. Rahat Khan wrote novels about middle class city people, their joys and sorrows, love and separation. His significant works include Omol Dhabol Chakri, Ek Priyodorshini, Chhayadampoti, Hai Shunyota, Sangharsho, Shahar, Hai Anonter Pakhi, Modhyomather Khelowar etc.\\r\\nAkhtaruzzaman Elias, one of the most artistic but least productive writers, wrote only two novels. He has started his journey with Chilekothar Sepai. His most prestigious work Khoabnama, which came out in 1996, is considered a milestone in the history of Bengali novels.\\r\\nAnother senior novelist Abu Ishaque's second novel Padmar Palidwip was published in 1986, after thirty-one years of his debut novel Surjo Dighal Bari. Appearance and disappearance of Chars (strip of sandy land), their effect on nearby humanity etc. have taken a keen narration in Padmar Palidwip.\\r\\nHaripada Datta is also a worthy name. His two-volume novel Ojogor (Vol. I -1989, Vol. II-1991) chronicles the recent past history very remarkably. His previous novels are Eshane Ognidaho and Ondhokupe Janmothsob. In 2000 he wrote an epic volume titled Jonmo Jonmantor.\\r\\nFrom the early years of the eighties, the arrival of some young novelists who, later on, obtained enough popularity, was heard. Monju Sarkar, Imdadul Haq Milon and Moinul Ahsan Saber are the few but most common names in this regard. Monju Sarkar's Tamosh, Nagno Agontuk, Protima Upakhyan and Abashbhumi, Imdadul Haq Milon's Jabojjibon (written in 1976, published in 1900), Nodi Upakhyan, Bhumiputro, Poradhinota, Rajakartontro, Moinul Ahsan Saber's Adomer Jonye Opekhkha, Pathor Somoy, Char Torun Toruni, Manush Jekhane Jai Na, Dharabahik Kahin, Opeksha, Kobej Lethel, Tumi Amake Niye Jabe, Prem O Protishodh, Songsher Japon got much recognition from the literati. Shahidul Zahir, wrote his first novel Jibon O Rajnoitic Bastobota, published in 1988 while his second, till now the last, Shei Rate Purnima Chhilo came out in 1995. Magic realism, which is a recent trend of the Latin American novels, takes place in Shahidul Zahir's narration.\\r\\nThe last decade of twentieth century is comparatively fruitful for Bangladeshi novels. Al Mahmud's novelistic exposition, Bipradas Barua's Buddhist life, Humayun Azad's brave creations, Akimun Rahman's novels about womanhood, Nasreen Jahan's novels of magic realism, Shamsuddin Abul Kalam's historic work Kanchongram is few mark of this decade. Syed Shamsul Haq's masterpiece Bristi O Bidrohigon, published in 1998, is a milestone on the past heritage and liberation war. Senior poet Al Mahmud's debut novel Dahuki came out in 1992 which was followed by Kobi O Kolahol, Upamohadesh, Kabiler Bone, Purush Sundor, Nishinda Nari etc. Bipradas Barua's major novels are Somudrochar O Bidrohira, Muktijoddhara, Shromon Goutam etc.\\r\\nHumayun Azad commenced his novelist carrier with Chhappanno Hajar Borgomile in 1994, which was a courageous slap on martial law and dictatorship. In no time the novel brought its writer much name and popularity. His later novels include Sob Kichhu Bhenge Pore, Subhabrata, Tar Samparkita Susamachar, Rajnitibidgon etc. Mohammad Nurul Huda, a renowned poet, had also two attempts in novel. Excepting Janmajati and Moinpahar he did not make any third attempt. Akimun Rahman is the first novelist ever in Bengali language in whose writing the untold and unknown secrets of womanhood are getting tongue. She has by now written four novels, Purusher Prithibite Ek Meye, Roktopunje Genthe Jawya Machhi, Pashe Shudhu Chhaya Chhilo, and Jeebaner Roudre Udechhilo Kayekti Dhulikana. Another notable novelist is Nasreen Jahan. Her first novel Urukku arrived with much appreciation. In her novels like Chondrer Prothom Kola, Chondrolekhar Jaadubistar, Sonali Mukhosh, Ure Jai Nishipakhkhi etc., she manipulated the elements of magic realism. Anisul Hoque, a journalist by profession, has established himself as a renowned writer. His Andhokarer Ekshaw Bachhar presented him a very honourable place but Ma (The Mother) has given him international reputation. Imtiar Shamim is also a young but promising name for the novels of recent Bangladesh. In Dana Kata Himer Bhetor he presented an NGO-world. His Amra Hetechhi Jara encompassed a very touching story of the sorry saga of post-independence Bangladesh life. In the first decade of 21st century, literary critic and essayist Syed Manzoorul Islam wrote some experimental novels like Adhkhana Manush, Tin Parber Jiban etc.; he also co-authored Jogajoger Gabheer Samasya Niye Kayekjan Eka Eka Lok which is one of few metafiction novels in Bengali. Agunpakhi by Hasan Azizul Huq received wide critical acclaim both in Bangladesh and India and two important literary award Prothom Alo book of the year prize in 2007 and Ananda Purashkar in 2008.[3] Among other notable works, Shahaduz Zaman's novel Bishorgo Te Dukkho is a pioneer work of the genre of metafiction in Bengali, and his Kracher Colonel is a popular historical novel on the life of Colonel Taher.","input":"What were the basic themes of early bengali novels?"},{"output":"Do not do this, do not do that","context":"Fais pas ci, fais pas ?a (English translation: Do not do this, do not do that) was a French television series created by Anne Giafferi and Thierry Bizot.

[2]","input":"Fais pas ci fais pas ?a in english?"},{"output":"Water vapor","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nWater vapor, water vapour or aqueous vapor is the gaseous phase of water. It is one state of water within the hydrosphere. Water vapor can be produced from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water or from the sublimation of ice. Unlike other forms of water, water vapor is invisible.[4] Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by condensation. It is less dense than air and triggers convection currents that can lead to clouds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a component of Earth's hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle, it is particularly abundant in Earth's atmosphere where it is also a potent greenhouse gas along with other gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Use of water vapor, as steam, has been important to humans for cooking and as a major component in energy production and transport systems since the industrial revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater vapor is a relatively common atmospheric constituent, present even in the solar atmosphere as well as every planet in the Solar System and many astronomical objects including natural satellites, comets and even large asteroids. Likewise the detection of extrasolar water vapor would indicate a similar distribution in other planetary systems. Water vapor is significant in that it can be indirect evidence supporting the presence of extraterrestrial liquid water in the case of some planetary mass objects.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever a water molecule leaves a surface and diffuses into a surrounding gas, it is said to have evaporated. Each individual water molecule which transitions between a more associated (liquid) and a less associated (vapor/gas) state does so through the absorption or release of kinetic energy. The aggregate measurement of this kinetic energy transfer is defined as thermal energy and occurs only when there is differential in the temperature of the water molecules. Liquid water that becomes water vapor takes a parcel of heat with it, in a process called evaporative cooling.[5] The amount of water vapor in the air determines how frequently molecules will return to the surface. When a net evaporation occurs, the body of water will undergo a net cooling directly related to the loss of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US, the National Weather Service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized \\"pan\\" open water surface outdoors, at various locations nationwide. Others do likewise around the world. The US data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation map.[6] The measurements range from under 30 to over 120?inches per year. Formulas can be used for calculating the rate of evaporation from a water surface such as a swimming pool.[7][8] In some countries, the evaporation rate far exceeds the precipitation rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvaporative cooling is restricted by atmospheric conditions. Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. The vapor content of air is measured with devices known as hygrometers. The measurements are usually expressed as specific humidity or percent relative humidity. The temperatures of the atmosphere and the water surface determine the equilibrium vapor pressure; 100% relative humidity occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure. This condition is often referred to as complete saturation. Humidity ranges from 0?gram per cubic metre in dry air to 30?grams per cubic metre (0.03 ounce per cubic foot) when the vapor is saturated at 30?C.[9]\\r\\n(See also Absolute Humidity table)[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSublimation is when water molecules directly leave the surface of ice without first becoming liquid water. Sublimation accounts for the slow mid-winter disappearance of ice and snow at temperatures too low to cause melting. Antarctica shows this effect to a unique degree because it is by far the continent with the lowest rate of precipitation on Earth. As a result, there are large areas where millennial layers of snow have sublimed, leaving behind whatever non-volatile materials they had contained. This is extremely valuable to certain scientific disciplines, a dramatic example being the collection of meteorites that are left exposed in unparalleled numbers and excellent states of preservation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSublimation is important in the preparation of certain classes of biological specimens for scanning electron microscopy. Typically the specimens are prepared by cryofixation and freeze-fracture, after which the broken surface is freeze-etched, being eroded by exposure to vacuum till it shows the required level of detail. This technique can display protein molecules, organelle structures and lipid bilayers with very low degrees of distortion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater vapor will only condense onto another surface when that surface is cooler than the dew point temperature, or when the water vapor equilibrium in air has been exceeded. When water vapor condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. The water molecule brings heat energy with it. In turn, the temperature of the atmosphere drops slightly.[11] In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by cloud condensation nuclei). The dew point of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapor in the air begins to condense concluding water vapor is a type of water or rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, a net condensation of water vapor occurs on surfaces when the temperature of the surface is at or below the dew point temperature of the atmosphere. Deposition is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapor. Frost and snow are examples of deposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of chemical reactions have water as a product. If the reactions take place at temperatures higher than the dew point of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity, if below the dew point local condensation will occur. Typical reactions that result in water formation are the burning of hydrogen or hydrocarbons in air or other oxygen containing gas mixtures, or as a result of reactions with oxidizers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a similar fashion other chemical or physical reactions can take place in the presence of water vapor resulting in new chemicals forming such as rust on iron or steel, polymerization occurring (certain polyurethane foams and cyanoacrylate glues cure with exposure to atmospheric humidity) or forms changing such as where anhydrous chemicals may absorb enough vapor to form a crystalline structure or alter an existing one, sometimes resulting in characteristic color changes that can be used for measurement.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeasuring the quantity of water vapor in a medium can be done directly or remotely with varying degrees of accuracy. Remote methods such electromagnetic absorption are possible from satellites above planetary atmospheres. Direct methods may use electronic transducers, moistened thermometers or hygroscopic materials measuring changes in physical properties or dimensions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater vapor is lighter or less dense than dry air.[12][13] At equivalent temperatures it is buoyant with respect to dry air, whereby the density of dry air at standard temperature and pressure is 1.27?g/L and water vapor at standard temperature and pressure has the much lower density of 0.804?g/L.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater vapor and dry air density calculations at 0?C:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same temperature, a column of dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air containing any water vapor, the molar mass of diatomic nitrogen and diatomic oxygen both being greater than the molar mass of water. Thus, any volume of dry air will sink if placed in a larger volume of moist air. Also, a volume of moist air will rise or be buoyant if placed in a larger region of dry air. As the temperature rises the proportion of water vapor in the air increases, and its buoyancy will increase. The increase in buoyancy can have a significant atmospheric impact, giving rise to powerful, moisture rich, upward air currents when the air temperature and sea temperature reaches 25?C or above. This phenomenon provides a significant driving force for cyclonic and anticyclonic weather systems (typhoons and hurricanes).\\r\\n\\r\\nWater vapor is a by-product of respiration in plants and animals. Its contribution to the pressure, increases as its concentration increases. Its partial pressure contribution to air pressure increases, lowering the partial pressure contribution of the other atmospheric gases (Dalton's Law). The total air pressure must remain constant. The presence of water vapor in the air naturally dilutes or displaces the other air components as its concentration increases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can have an effect on respiration. In very warm air (35?C) the proportion of water vapor is large enough to give rise to the stuffiness that can be experienced in humid jungle conditions or in poorly ventilated buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater vapor has lower density than that of air and is therefore buoyant in air but has lower vapor pressure than that of air. When water vapor is used as a lifting gas by a thermal airship the water vapor is heated to form steam so that its vapor pressure is greater than the surrounding air pressure in order to maintain the shape of a theoretical \\"steam balloon\\", which yields approximately 60% the lift of helium and twice that of hot air.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amount of water vapor in an atmosphere is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature. Dew point temperature and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the water cycle. Energy input, such as sunlight, can trigger more evaporation on an ocean surface or more sublimation on a chunk of ice on top of a mountain. The balance between condensation and evaporation gives the quantity called vapor partial pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maximum partial pressure (saturation pressure) of water vapor in air varies with temperature of the air and water vapor mixture. A variety of empirical formulas exist for this quantity; the most used reference formula is the Goff-Gratch equation for the SVP over liquid water below zero degree Celsius:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formula is valid from about ?50 to 102?C; however there are a very limited number of measurements of the vapor pressure of water over supercooled liquid water. There are a number of other formulae which can be used.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder certain conditions, such as when the boiling temperature of water is reached, a net evaporation will always occur during standard atmospheric conditions regardless of the percent of relative humidity. This immediate process will dispel massive amounts of water vapor into a cooler atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nExhaled air is almost fully at equilibrium with water vapor at the body temperature. In the cold air the exhaled vapor quickly condenses, thus showing up as a fog or mist of water droplets and as condensation or frost on surfaces. Forcibly condensing these water droplets from exhaled breath is the basis of exhaled breath condensate, an evolving medical diagnostic test.\\r\\n\\r\\nControlling water vapor in air is a key concern in the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) industry. Thermal comfort depends on the moist air conditions. Non-human comfort situations are called refrigeration, and also are affected by water vapor. For example, many food stores, like supermarkets, utilize open chiller cabinets, or food cases, which can significantly lower the water vapor pressure (lowering humidity). This practice delivers several benefits as well as problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nGaseous water represents a small but environmentally significant constituent of the atmosphere. The percentage water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01% at -42?C (-44?F)[16] to 4.24% when the dew point is 30?C (86?F).[17] Approximately 99.13% of it is contained in the troposphere. The condensation of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for clouds, rain, snow, and other precipitation, all of which count among the most significant elements of what we experience as weather. Less obviously, the latent heat of vaporization, which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs, is one of the most important terms in the atmospheric energy budget on both local and global scales. For example, latent heat release in atmospheric convection is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as tropical cyclones and severe thunderstorms. Water vapor is the most potent greenhouse gas owing to the presence of the hydroxyl bond which strongly absorbs in the infra-red region of the light spectrum.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater in Earth's atmosphere is not merely below its boiling point (100?C), but at altitude it goes below its freezing point (0?C), due to water's highly polar attraction. When combined with its quantity, water vapor then has a relevant dew point and frost point, unlike e. g., carbon dioxide and methane. Water vapor thus has a scale height a fraction of that of the bulk atmosphere,[18][19][20] as the water condenses and exits, primarily in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere.[21] Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, being non-polar, rise above water vapor. The absorption and emission of both compounds contribute to Earth's emission to space, and thus the planetary greenhouse effect.[19][22][23] This greenhouse forcing is directly observable, via distinct spectral features versus water vapor, and observed to be rising with rising CO2 levels.[24] Conversely, adding water vapor at high altitudes has a disproportionate impact, which is why methane (rising, then oxidizing to CO2 and two water molecules) and jet traffic[25][26][27] have disproportionately high warming effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is less clear how cloudiness would respond to a warming climate; depending on the nature of the response, clouds could either further amplify or partly mitigate warming from long-lived greenhouse gases.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the absence of other greenhouse gases, Earth's water vapor would condense to the surface;[28][29][30] this has likely happened, possibly more than once. Scientists thus distinguish between non-condensable (driving) and condensable (driven) greenhouse gases, i.e., the above water vapor feedback.[31][32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nFog and clouds form through condensation around cloud condensation nuclei. In the absence of nuclei, condensation will only occur at much lower temperatures. Under persistent condensation or deposition, cloud droplets or snowflakes form, which precipitate when they reach a critical mass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe water content of the atmosphere as a whole is constantly depleted by precipitation. At the same time it is constantly replenished by evaporation, most prominently from seas, lakes, rivers, and moist earth. Other sources of atmospheric water include combustion, respiration, volcanic eruptions, the transpiration of plants, and various other biological and geological processes. The mean global content of water vapor in the atmosphere is roughly sufficient to cover the surface of the planet with a layer of liquid water about 25?mm deep. The mean annual precipitation for the planet is about 1 meter, which implies a rapid turnover of water in the air ÿ on average, the residence time of a water molecule in the troposphere is about 9 to 10 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nEpisodes of surface geothermal activity, such as volcanic eruptions and geysers, release variable amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. Such eruptions may be large in human terms, and major explosive eruptions may inject exceptionally large masses of water exceptionally high into the atmosphere, but as a percentage of total atmospheric water, the role of such processes is minor. The relative concentrations of the various gases emitted by volcanoes varies considerably according to the site and according to the particular event at any one site. However, water vapor is consistently the commonest volcanic gas; as a rule, it comprises more than 60% of total emissions during a subaerial eruption.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAtmospheric water vapor content is expressed using various measures. These include vapor pressure, specific humidity, mixing ratio, dew point temperature, and relative humidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause water molecules absorb microwaves and other radio wave frequencies, water in the atmosphere attenuates radar signals.[35] In addition, atmospheric water will reflect and refract signals to an extent that depends on whether it is vapor, liquid or solid.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, radar signals lose strength progressively the farther they travel through the troposphere. Different frequencies attenuate at different rates, such that some components of air are opaque to some frequencies and transparent to others. Radio waves used for broadcasting and other communication experience the same effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater vapor reflects radar to a lesser extent than do water's other two phases. In the form of drops and ice crystals, water acts as a prism, which it does not do as an individual molecule; however, the existence of water vapor in the atmosphere causes the atmosphere to act as a giant prism.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nA comparison of GOES-12 satellite images shows the distribution of atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds and continents of the Earth. Vapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed. The image loop on the right shows monthly average of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters, which is the precipitable water or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in yellow, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite. The most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter. Another pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs water vapour absorbs light in the visible spectral range, its absorption can be used in spectroscopic applications (such as DOAS) to determine the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. This is done operationally, e.g. from the GOME spectrometers on ERS and MetOp.[38] The weaker water vapor absorption lines in the blue spectral range and further into the UV up to its dissociation limit around 243?nm are mostly based on quantum mechanical calculations[39] and are only partly confirmed by experiments.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nWater vapor plays a key role in lightning production in the atmosphere. From cloud physics, usually clouds are the real generators of static charge as found in Earth's atmosphere. The ability of clouds to hold massive amounts of electrical energy is directly related to the amount of water vapor present in the local system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amount of water vapor directly controls the permittivity of the air. During times of low humidity, static discharge is quick and easy. During times of higher humidity, fewer static discharges occur. Permittivity and capacitance work hand in hand to produce the megawatt outputs of lightning.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a cloud, for instance, has started its way to becoming a lightning generator, atmospheric water vapor acts as a substance (or insulator) that decreases the ability of the cloud to discharge its electrical energy. Over a certain amount of time, if the cloud continues to generate and store more static electricity, the barrier that was created by the atmospheric water vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential energy.[42] This energy will be released to a locally, oppositely charged region in the form of lightning. The strength of each discharge is directly related to the atmospheric permittivity, capacitance, and the source's charge generating ability.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nWater vapor is common in the Solar System and by extension, other planetary systems. Its signature has been detected in the atmospheres of the Sun, occurring in sunspots. The presence of water vapor has been detected in the atmospheres of all seven extraterrestrial planets in the solar system, the Earth's Moon,[44] and the moons of other planets,[which?] although typically in only trace amounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeological formations such as cryogeysers are thought to exist on the surface of several icy moons ejecting water vapor due to tidal heating and may indicate the presence of substantial quantities of subsurface water. Plumes of water vapor have been detected on Jupiter's moon Europa and are similar to plumes of water vapor detected on Saturn's moon Enceladus.[45] Traces of water vapor have also been detected in the stratosphere of Titan.[47] Water vapor has been found to be a major constituent of the atmosphere of dwarf planet, Ceres, largest object in the asteroid belt[48] The detection was made by using the far-infrared abilities of the Herschel Space Observatory.[49] The finding is unexpected because comets, not asteroids, are typically considered to \\"sprout jets and plumes.\\" According to one of the scientists, \\"The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids.\\"[49] Scientists studying Mars hypothesize that if water moves about the planet, it does so as vapor.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brilliance of comet tails comes largely from water vapor. On approach to the Sun, the ice many comets carry sublimates to vapor, which reflects light from the Sun. Knowing a comet's distance from the sun, astronomers may deduce a comet's water content from its brilliance.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nWater vapor has also been confirmed outside the Solar System. Spectroscopic analysis of HD 209458 b, an extrasolar planet in the constellation Pegasus, provides the first evidence of atmospheric water vapor beyond the Solar System. A star called CW Leonis was found to have a ring of vast quantities of water vapor circling the aging, massive star. A NASA satellite designed to study chemicals in interstellar gas clouds, made the discovery with an onboard spectrometer. Most likely, \\"the water vapor was vaporized from the surfaces of orbiting comets.\\"[52] HAT-P-11b a relatively small exoplanet has also been found to possess water vapour.[53]","input":"What is the gaseous state of water called?"},{"output":"Nicphore Nipce","context":"The history of the camera can be traced much further back than the introduction of photography. Cameras evolved from the camera obscura, and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film, and to the modern day with digital cameras.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forerunner to the photographic camera was the camera obscura. Camera obscura (Latin for \\"dark room\\") is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen and forms an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The oldest known record of this principle is a description by Han Chinese philosopher Mozi (ca. 470 to ca. 391 BC). Mozi correctly asserted that the camera obscura image is inverted because light travels in straight lines from its source. In the 11th century Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen)'s wrote very influential books about optics, including experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened room.\\r\\nThe use of a lens in the opening of a wall or closed window shutter of a darkened room to project images used as a drawing aid has been traced back to circa 1550. Since the late 17th century portable camera obscura devices in tents and boxes were used as a drawing aid.\\r\\nBefore the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them. The earliest cameras were room-sized, with space for one or more people inside; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models. By Nipce's time portable box camerae obscurae suitable for photography were readily available. The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685, though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible.\\r\\nThe first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicphore Nipce,[1][2] using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light. No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Nipce, so the photograph was not permanent, eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it. In the mid-1820s, Nipce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea.[3] The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away. One of those photographs has survived.\\r\\nAfter Nipce's death in 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839.[4] Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many minutes as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.[5]\\r\\nCollodion dry plates had been available since 1857, thanks to the work of Dsir van Monckhoven, but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed. The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called \\"instantaneous\\" snapshot exposures practical. For the first time, a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity. With daylight and a fast plate or film, a small camera could be hand-held while taking the picture. The ranks of amateur photographers swelled and informal \\"candid\\" portraits became popular. There was a proliferation of camera designs, from single- and twin-lens reflexes to large and bulky field cameras, simple box cameras, and even \\"detective cameras\\" disguised as pocket watches, hats, or other objects.\\r\\nThe short exposure times that made candid photography possible also necessitated another innovation, the mechanical shutter. The very first shutters were separate accessories, though built-in shutters were common by the end of the 19th century.[5]\\r\\nThe use of photographic film was pioneered by George Eastman, who started manufacturing paper film in 1885 before switching to celluloid in 1888-1889. His first camera, which he called the \\"Kodak,\\" was first offered for sale in 1888. It was a very simple box camera with a fixed-focus lens and single shutter speed, which along with its relatively low price appealed to the average consumer. The Kodak came pre-loaded with enough film for 100 exposures and needed to be sent back to the factory for processing and reloading when the roll was finished. By the end of the 19th century Eastman had expanded his lineup to several models including both box and folding cameras.\\r\\nIn 1900, Eastman took mass-market photography one step further with the Brownie, a simple and very inexpensive box camera that introduced the concept of the snapshot. The Brownie was extremely popular and various models remained on sale until the 1960s.\\r\\nFilm also allowed the movie camera to develop from an expensive toy to a practical commercial tool.\\r\\nDespite the advances in low-cost photography made possible by Eastman, plate cameras still offered higher-quality prints and remained popular well into the 20th century. To compete with rollfilm cameras, which offered a larger number of exposures per loading, many inexpensive plate cameras from this era were equipped with magazines to hold several plates at once. Special backs for plate cameras allowing them to use film packs or rollfilm were also available, as were backs that enabled rollfilm cameras to use plates.\\r\\nExcept for a few special types such as Schmidt cameras, most professional astrographs continued to use plates until the end of the 20th century when electronic photography replaced them.\\r\\nA number of manufacturers started to use 35mm film for still photography between 1905 and 1913. The first 35mm cameras available to the public, and reaching significant numbers in sales were the Tourist Multiple, in 1913, and the Simplex, in 1914.[citation needed]\\r\\nOskar Barnack, who was in charge of research and development at Leitz, decided to investigate using 35?mm cine film for still cameras while attempting to build a compact camera capable of making high-quality enlargements. He built his prototype 35?mm camera (Ur-Leica) around 1913, though further development was delayed for several years by World War I. It wasn't until after World War I that Leica commercialized their first 35mm Cameras. Leitz test-marketed the design between 1923 and 1924, receiving enough positive feedback that the camera was put into production as the Leica I (for Leitz camera) in 1925. The Leica's immediate popularity spawned a number of competitors, most notably the Contax (introduced in 1932), and cemented the position of 35 mm as the format of choice for high-end compact cameras.\\r\\nKodak got into the market with the Retina I in 1934, which introduced the 135 cartridge used in all modern 35?mm cameras. Although the Retina was comparatively inexpensive, 35?mm cameras were still out of reach for most people and rollfilm remained the format of choice for mass-market cameras. This changed in 1936 with the introduction of the inexpensive Argus A and to an even greater extent in 1939 with the arrival of the immensely popular Argus C3. Although the cheapest cameras still used rollfilm, 35?mm film had come to dominate the market by the time the C3 was discontinued in 1966.\\r\\nThe fledgling Japanese camera industry began to take off in 1936 with the Canon 35?mm rangefinder, an improved version of the 1933 Kwanon prototype. Japanese cameras would begin to become popular in the West after Korean War veterans and soldiers stationed in Japan brought them back to the United States and elsewhere.\\r\\nThe first practical reflex camera was the Franke & Heidecke Rolleiflex medium format TLR of 1928. Though both single- and twin-lens reflex cameras had been available for decades, they were too bulky to achieve much popularity. The Rolleiflex, however, was sufficiently compact to achieve widespread popularity and the medium-format TLR design became popular for both high- and low-end cameras.\\r\\nA similar revolution in SLR design began in 1933 with the introduction of the Ihagee Exakta, a compact SLR which used 127 rollfilm. This was followed three years later by the first Western SLR to use 135 film, the Kine Exakta (World's first true 35mm SLR was Soviet \\"Sport\\" camera, marketed several months before Kine Exakta, though \\"Sport\\" used its own film cartridge). The 35mm SLR design gained immediate popularity and there was an explosion of new models and innovative features after World War II. There were also a few 35mm TLRs, the best-known of which was the Contaflex of 1935, but for the most part these met with little success.\\r\\nThe first major post-war SLR innovation was the eye-level viewfinder, which first appeared on the Hungarian Duflex in 1947 and was refined in 1948 with the Contax S, the first camera to use a pentaprism. Prior to this, all SLRs were equipped with waist-level focusing screens. The Duflex was also the first SLR with an instant-return mirror, which prevented the viewfinder from being blacked out after each exposure. This same time period also saw the introduction of the Hasselblad 1600F, which set the standard for medium format SLRs for decades.\\r\\nIn 1952 the Asahi Optical Company (which later became well known for its Pentax cameras) introduced the first Japanese SLR using 135 film, the Asahiflex. Several other Japanese camera makers also entered the SLR market in the 1950s, including Canon, Yashica, and Nikon. Nikon's entry, the Nikon F, had a full line of interchangeable components and accessories and is generally regarded as the first Japanese system camera. It was the F, along with the earlier S series of rangefinder cameras, that helped establish Nikon's reputation as a maker of professional-quality equipment.\\r\\nWhile conventional cameras were becoming more refined and sophisticated, an entirely new type of camera appeared on the market in 1948. This was the Polaroid Model 95, the world's first viable instant-picture camera. Known as a Land Camera after its inventor, Edwin Land, the Model 95 used a patented chemical process to produce finished positive prints from the exposed negatives in under a minute. The Land Camera caught on despite its relatively high price and the Polaroid lineup had expanded to dozens of models by the 1960s. The first Polaroid camera aimed at the popular market, the Model 20 Swinger of 1965, was a huge success and remains one of the top-selling cameras of all time.\\r\\nThe first camera to feature automatic exposure was the selenium light meter-equipped, fully automatic Super Kodak Six-20 pack of 1938, but its extremely high price (for the time) of $225 ($3912 in present terms[6]) kept it from achieving any degree of success. By the 1960s, however, low-cost electronic components were commonplace and cameras equipped with light meters and automatic exposure systems became increasingly widespread.\\r\\nThe next technological advance came in 1960, when the German Mec 16 SB subminiature became the first camera to place the light meter behind the lens for more accurate metering. However, through-the-lens metering ultimately became a feature more commonly found on SLRs than other types of camera; the first SLR equipped with a TTL system was the Topcon RE Super of 1962.\\r\\nDigital cameras differ from their analog predecessors primarily in that they do not use film, but capture and save photographs on digital memory cards or internal storage instead. Their low operating costs have relegated chemical cameras to niche markets. Digital cameras now include wireless communication capabilities (for example Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) to transfer, print or share photos, and are commonly found on mobile phones.\\r\\nThe concept of digitizing images on scanners, and the concept of digitizing video signals, predate the concept of making still pictures by digitizing signals from an array of discrete sensor elements. Early spy satellites used the extremely complex and expensive method of de-orbit and airborne retrieval of film canisters. Technology was pushed to skip these steps through the use of in-satellite developing and electronic scanning of the film for direct transmission to the ground. The amount of film was still a major limitation, and this was overcome and greatly simplified by the push to develop an electronic image capturing array that could be used instead of film. The first electronic imaging satellite was the KH-11 launched by the NRO in late 1976. It had a charge-coupled device (CCD) array with a resolution of 800 x 800 pixels (0.64 megapixels).[7] At Philips Labs in New York, Edward Stupp, Pieter Cath and Zsolt Szilagyi filed for a patent on \\"All Solid State Radiation Imagers\\" on 6 September 1968 and constructed a flat-screen target for receiving and storing an optical image on a matrix composed of an array of photodiodes connected to a capacitor to form an array of two terminal devices connected in rows and columns. Their US patent was granted on 10 November 1970.[8] Texas Instruments engineer Willis Adcock designed a filmless camera that was not digital and applied for a patent in 1972, but it is not known whether it was ever built.[9] The Cromemco CYCLOPS introduced as a hobbyist construction project in 1975[10] was the first digital camera to be interfaced to a microcomputer.\\r\\nThe first recorded attempt at building a self-contained digital camera was in 1975 by Steven Sasson, an engineer at Eastman Kodak.[11][12] It used the then-new solid-state CCD image sensor chips developed by Fairchild Semiconductor in 1973.[13] The camera weighed 8 pounds (3.6?kg), recorded black and white images to a compact cassette tape, had a resolution of 0.01?megapixels (10,000 pixels), and took 23 seconds to capture its first image in December 1975. The prototype camera was a technical exercise, not intended for production.\\r\\nHandheld electronic cameras, in the sense of a device meant to be carried and used like a handheld film camera, appeared in 1981 with the demonstration of the Sony Mavica (Magnetic Video Camera). This is not to be confused with the later cameras by Sony that also bore the Mavica name. This was an analog camera, in that it recorded pixel signals continuously, as videotape machines did, without converting them to discrete levels; it recorded television-like signals to a 2?G?2?inch \\"video floppy\\".[14] In essence it was a video movie camera that recorded single frames, 50 per disk in field mode and 25 per disk in frame mode. The image quality was considered equal to that of then-current televisions.\\r\\nAnalog electronic cameras do not appear to have reached the market until 1986 with the Canon RC-701. Canon demonstrated a prototype of this model at the 1984 Summer Olympics, printing the images in the Yomiuri Shinbun, a Japanese newspaper. In the United States, the first publication to use these cameras for real reportage was USA Today, in its coverage of World Series baseball. Several factors held back the widespread adoption of analog cameras; the cost (upwards of $20,000), poor image quality compared to film, and the lack of quality affordable printers. Capturing and printing an image originally required access to equipment such as a frame grabber, which was beyond the reach of the average consumer. The \\"video floppy\\" disks later had several reader devices available for viewing on a screen, but were never standardized as a computer drive.\\r\\nThe early adopters tended to be in the news media, where the cost was negated by the utility and the ability to transmit images by telephone lines. The poor image quality was offset by the low resolution of newspaper graphics. This capability to transmit images without a satellite link was useful during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the first Gulf War in 1991.\\r\\nUS government agencies also took a strong interest in the still video concept, notably the US Navy for use as a real time air-to-sea surveillance system.\\r\\nThe first analog electronic camera marketed to consumers may have been the Casio VS-101 in 1987. A notable analog camera produced the same year was the Nikon QV-1000C, designed as a press camera and not offered for sale to general users, which sold only a few hundred units. It recorded images in greyscale, and the quality in newspaper print was equal to film cameras. In appearance it closely resembled a modern digital single-lens reflex camera. Images were stored on video floppy disks.\\r\\nSilicon Film, a proposed digital sensor cartridge for film cameras that would allow 35?mm cameras to take digital photographs without modification was announced in late 1998. Silicon Film was to work like a roll of 35?mm film, with a 1.3 megapixel sensor behind the lens and a battery and storage unit fitting in the film holder in the camera. The product, which was never released, became increasingly obsolete due to improvements in digital camera technology and affordability. Silicon Films' parent company filed for bankruptcy in 2001.[15]\\r\\nBy the late 1980s, the technology required to produce truly commercial digital cameras existed. The first true portable digital camera that recorded images as a computerized file was likely the Fuji DS-1P of 1988, which recorded to a 2?MB SRAM memory card that used a battery to keep the data in memory. This camera was never marketed to the public.\\r\\nThe first digital camera of any kind ever sold commercially was possibly the MegaVision Tessera in 1987 [16] though there is not extensive documentation of its sale known. The first portable digital camera that was actually marketed commercially was sold in December 1989 in Japan, the DS-X by Fuji[17] The first commercially available portable digital camera in the United States was the Dycam Model?1, first shipped in November 1990.[18] It was originally a commercial failure because it was black and white, low in resolution, and cost nearly $1,000 (about $2000 in 2014).[19] It later saw modest success when it was re-sold as the Logitech Fotoman in 1992. It used a CCD image sensor, stored pictures digitally, and connected directly to a computer for download.[20][21][22]\\r\\nIn 1991, Kodak brought to market the Kodak DCS (Kodak Digital Camera System), the beginning of a long line of professional Kodak DCS SLR cameras that were based in part on film bodies, often Nikons. It used a 1.3?megapixel sensor, had a bulky external digital storage system and was priced at $13,000. At the arrival of the Kodak DCS-200, the Kodak DCS was dubbed Kodak DCS-100.\\r\\nThe move to digital formats was helped by the formation of the first JPEG and MPEG standards in 1988, which allowed image and video files to be compressed for storage. The first consumer camera with a liquid crystal display on the back was the Casio QV-10 developed by a team led by Hiroyuki Suetaka in 1995. The first camera to use CompactFlash was the Kodak DC-25 in 1996.[citation needed]. The first camera that offered the ability to record video clips may have been the Ricoh RDC-1 in 1995.\\r\\nIn 1995 Minolta introduced the RD-175, which was based on the Minolta 500si SLR with a splitter and three independent CCDs. This combination delivered 1.75M pixels. The benefit of using an SLR base was the ability to use any existing Minolta AF mount lens. 1999 saw the introduction of the Nikon D1, a 2.74?megapixel camera that was the first digital SLR developed entirely from the ground up by a major manufacturer, and at a cost of under $6,000 at introduction was affordable by professional photographers and high-end consumers. This camera also used Nikon F-mount lenses, which meant film photographers could use many of the same lenses they already owned.\\r\\nDigital camera sales continued to flourish, driven by technology advances. The digital market segmented into different categories, Compact Digital Still Cameras, Bridge Cameras, Mirrorless Compacts and Digital SLRs. One of the major technology advances was the development of CMOS sensors, which helped drive sensor costs low enough to enable the widespread adoption of camera phones.\\r\\nSince 2003, digital cameras have outsold film cameras[23] and Kodak announced in January 2004 that they would no longer sell Kodak-branded film cameras in the developed world[24] - and 2012 filed for bankruptcy after struggling to adapt to the changing industry.[25] Smartphones now routinely include high resolution digital cameras.\\r\\nNotes","input":"Who invented the first camera in the 1800s?"},{"output":"a worldwide range","context":"","input":"What ocean zone does the sperm whale live in?"},{"output":"27 percent of the population aged 65 and older","context":"The educational attainment of the U.S. population is similar to that of many other industrialized countries with the vast majority of the population having completed secondary education and a rising number of college graduates that outnumber high school dropouts. As a whole, the population of the United States is spending more years in formal educational programs. As with income, levels differ by race, age, household configuration and geography.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the households and demographics featuring the highest educational attainment in the United States are also among those with the highest household income and wealth. Thus, while the population as a whole is proceeding further in formal educational programs, income and educational attainment remain highly correlated.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, over four-fifths (85 percent) of all adults 25 years or older reported they had completed at least high school, or obtained a GED/high school equivalency certificate. Over one in four adults (27 percent) had attained at least a bachelor's degree. Both of these measures are all time highs. In 2003, the percentage of the adult population who had completed high school or had not completed high school but obtained a GED increased for the first time since 2000, when it was 84 percent. This increase follows a general trend that the Current Population Survey has shown since educational attainment was first measured in 1947.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, among adults aged 65 and older, 84 percent had either completed high school or more education, or had failed to complete high school but obtained at least a GED certification, compared to 91 percent of adults aged 25 to 34 and 89 percent of adults aged 35 to 44 years or 45 to 64 years. In addition, 27 percent of the population aged 65 and older reported a bachelor's degree or more education compared to 36 percent of adults 25 to 34 years old and 32 percent of adults aged 45 to 64 years.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1983 the percentage of people either graduating from high school or failing to complete high school but getting a GED certification has increased from 85% to 88%. The greatest increases in educational attainment were documented in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. In the 1950s and much of the 1960s high school graduates constituted about 50% of those considered adults (25 and above). For young adults aged between 25 and 29, the percentage of either high school graduates or GED obtainers was roughly 50% in 1950 versus 90% today.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the past fifty years, there has been a gap in the educational achievement of males and females in the United States, but which gender has been disadvantaged has fluctuated over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s, data showed girls trailing behind boys in a variety of academic performance measures, specifically in test scores in math and science.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nData in the last twenty years shows the general trend of girls outperforming boys in academic achievement in terms of class grades across all subjects and college graduation rates, but boys scoring higher on standardized tests and being better represented in the higher-paying and more prestigious STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, girls have outperformed boys in reading and writing. Although this gap may be minimal in kindergarten, it grows as students continue their education. According to the 2004 National Reading Assessment measured by the US Department of Education, the gap between boys and girls, only slightly noticeable in 4th grade, left boys 14 points behind girls during their 12th grade year.[6] On the 2008 test, female students continued to have higher average reading scores than male students at all three ages. The gap between male and female 4th graders was 7 points in 2008. By 12th grade, there was an 11-point gap between males and females.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 2002 National Writing Assessment, boys scored on average 17 points lower than girls in 4th grade. The average gap increased to 21 points by 8th grade and widened to 24 points by senior year in high school.[7] In the more recent 2007 National Assessment of Writing Skills, female students continued to score higher than male students, though margins closed slightly from previous assessments. The average score for female eighth-graders was 20 points higher than males, down 1 point from the 2002 score. For twelfth-graders, females outscored males by 18 points as opposed to 24 points in 2002.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of these assessments were conducted on a 100-point scale.[6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, women have surpassed men in terms of completing secondary and post-secondary education with the gender gap almost completely reversed. In 2006, 10.3% of males and 8.3% of females dropped out of high school.[9] In 2005/2006, women earned 62% of associate degrees, 58% of bachelor's degrees, 60.0% of master's degrees, and 48.9% of Doctorates.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to recent datawhen?, 55 percent of college students are females and 45 percent are males. From 1995 until 2005, the number of males enrolled in college increased by 18 percent, while the number of female students rose by 27 percent.[11] Males are enrolling in college in greater numbers than ever before, yet fewer than two-thirds of them are graduating with a bachelor's degree. The numbers of both men and women receiving a bachelor's degree have increased significantly, but the increasing rate of female college graduates exceeds the increasing rate for males.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the United States Census Bureau estimated that 18,423,000 males  over the age of 18 held a bachelor's degree, while 20,501,000 females over the age 18 held one. In addition, fewer males held master's degrees: 6,472,000 males compared to 7,283,000 females. However, more men held professional and doctoral degrees than women. 2,033,000 males held professional degrees compared to 1,079,000, and 1,678,000 males had received a doctoral degree compared to 817,000 females.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, the United States Census Bureau estimated that 36.1% of individuals between the ages of 25 to 34 had a bachelor's degree, with 36.3% in individuals aged 35 to 44, 32% in individuals 45 to 64, and 26.7% in individuals 65 and older.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016/2017, women are projected to earn 64.2% of associate degrees, 59.9% of bachelor's degrees, 62.9% of master's degrees, and 55.5% of Doctorates.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the educational attainment of all races increased during the 1990s, with the gap between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites decreasing, differences between the races remain, especially among those with a bachelor's degree or higher. Asian Americans had the highest educational attainment of any race, followed by whites who had a higher percentage of high school graduates but a lower percentage of college graduates. Persons identifying as Hispanic or Latino, without regard to race, had the lowest educational attainment. The gap was the largest between foreign-born Asian Americans, over half (50.1%) of whom had a bachelor's degree or higher and foreign-born Hispanics, 9.8% of whom had a four-year college degree.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHispanics and Latinos also trailed far behind in terms of graduating from high school; it was the only major group for which high school graduates constituted less than 80% of the population. This large inequality might partially be explained by the influx of uneducated foreign-born Hispanic Americans who had not been offered the chance to complete secondary education in their home country and who had not completed secondary education in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, nearly half (49.8%) of Asian Americans, nearly a third (30%) of non-Hispanic Whites, 17.3% of non-Hispanic Blacks, and just over a tenth (11.4%) of Hispanics or Latinos had a four-year college degree. The same differences decrease significantly at the high school level with 89.4% of non-Hispanic whites, 87.6% of Asian Americans, 80.0% of African Americans, and 57% of Hispanics or Latinos having graduated from high school.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Racial achievement gap in the United States refers to these educational disparities between minority students and Caucasian students. Evidence of the racial achievement gap remains present today because not all groups of students are advancing at the same rates. The racial achievement gap has many individual and economic implications and there have been many efforts in education reform to narrow this gap.\\r\\n\\r\\nA trend becomes visible when comparing the foreign-born to the native-born populace of some races. Foreign-born Asian, European, and African immigrants had a higher educational attainment in terms of having earned a four-year college degree than their native-born counterparts. According to the U.S census about 43.8 percent of African immigrants achieved the most college degrees, compared to 42.5 percent of Asian-Americans, 28.9 percent for immigrants from Europe, Russia and Canada and 23.1 percent of the U.S. population as a whole.[15][16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opposite is true on the high school level and among Hispanics, where the dramatically lower educational attainment of the foreign-born population decreased the educational attainment of the general Hispanophone populace, statistically.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe percentage of the foreign born with a high school diploma (67 percent) was dramatically lower than that of the native population (88 percent), but paradoxically, the percentage with a bachelor's degree was the same (27 percent)... At the bachelor's level, foreign born Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites fared better than their native counterparts. Foreign-born Hispanics, in contrast, had a smaller proportion with a bachelor's degree than the native population... The low educational attainment of foreign-born Hispanics, who compose more than 50 percent of the Hispanic population, contributes to the low attainment levels of the entire Hispanic population. US Census Bureau, 2003\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly among Hispanics and Latinos was the proportion of college graduates larger among the native born population. In the general population the proportion of persons with a bachelor's degree or higher was the same among the foreign-born and native-born population (27.2%). As stated above fewer foreign born Americans completed high school than native born Americans. Overall, 87.5% of the native born population had graduated from high school, versus 67.2%. Among whites the difference was three percentage points, the same as for African Americans. Among Asian Americans the difference was five percentage points. It was thirty percentage points among Hispanics or Latinos.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican immigrants have been among the more highly educated group in the United States since the 1990s.[18][19] This phenomenon is related to the large \\"brain drain\\" in Africa.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nEducational attainment is strongly correlated with income in the United States. Although the incomes of both men and women are associated with higher educational attainment (higher incomes for higher educational attainment), large income gaps linked to race and gender remained at each educational level. In 2003, average incomes ranged from $13,459 for a male high-school dropout to $90,761 for a male with an advanced degree. The most significant average income difference was between those who had some college education or an associate degree and those who had a Bachelor's degree. While those with some college averaged $31,046, those with a bachelor's degree averaged $51,194, over $20,000 (64.9%) a year more.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second most dramatic difference in average income was between those with a Bachelor's degree with $51,940 and those with an advanced degree who made $72,824, roughly $21,000 (42.2%) more. The least significant difference was between those who had graduated from high school and those who had either some college or an associate degree. Here the difference was a mere $3,766 or 13.8%. The difference between those with a high school diploma ($30,000) and those who did not complete high school ($18,826) was $8,454 or 45%.\\r\\nOverall, the income in the United States for all sexes, races and levels of educational attainment was $36,308 annually.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though African immigrants are claimed to have higher educational attainment rates than any other group, they were the hardest hit during the most recent recession beginning in 2007.[21][16][22][23] This shows that race and/or ethnicity may play a role in income levels and job selection.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nSOURCE: US Census Bureau, 2003[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe change in median personal and household income since 1991 also varied greatly with educational attainment. While both the overall median personal and household income increased since 1991, this increase did not take place on all levels of educational attainment. The overall income increased over the course of the 1990s, reaching its high in 1999, but has been decreasing ever since. In 1991 the median household income in the US was $40,873 in 2003 dollars, while the median household income in 2003 was $45,016. In 1999, however, the median household income was $46,236, 2.7% higher than today. While this trend held true for all levels of educational attainment the extent of chorinical fluctuations in income were greatly influenced by educational attainment.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the median household and personal income decreased for those with more than a 9th grade education but less than a four-year college degree since 1991. In other words, the median household income decreased for households and individuals at the high school drop-outs and graduate, some-college, and an associate degree level. Income did, however, increase for those with a Bachelor's degree or more. The following table shows the median household income according to the educational attainment of the householder. All data is in 2003 dollars and only applies to householders whose householder is aged twenty-five or older. The highest and lowest points of the median household income are presented in bold face.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nSOURCE: US Census Bureau, 2003 Yellow indicates the year with the lowest median income while green indicates the year with the highest reported median income.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the races, educational attainment retains its dramatic effect on average income which varies significantly at each educational level. European Americans (White Americans) had the highest average income at every level of educational attainment. However, the proportion of those having college degrees is greater among Asian Americans than among non-Hispanic whites, and the overall highest average income is found among Asians. All races except Whites ranked last on at least one level with African Americans ranking last on the non-high school, high school and advanced degree level.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAsians were second highest on the college graduate level and had the highest overall income among the general population. They also had the lowest average annual income for those with some college education or an associate degree. Racial income difference were also significant at every level of educational attainment with the largest racial inequality being between European and African Americans who did not complete high school and those with advanced college degrees.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, European Americans with an advanced degree had the highest average annual income with $74,122. Asian Americans had the second highest with $72,852. Hispanics and African Americans had the lowest annual incomes among those with advanced degrees averaging $67,679 and $59,944 annually. The largest racial inequity was between European Americans with a Bachelor's degree who made $53,185 and Hispanics who made $12,263 or 29.9% less with an average annual income of $40,949.[2] However, Asian Americans as a whole earn more than any other race due to a greater percentage of them being educated overall, an example of Simpson's paradox.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe educational attainment varied significantly among the different types of occupations. The highest occupational attainment was among those in the Professional and related fields followed by those Business, Management and financial related occupations. The professional/managerial fields were the only two occupational fields where college graduates with a Bachelor's degree or higher represented the majority. Among professional occupations, 99.1% of the population graduated from high school, 90.2% had some college education or an associate degree and over two thirds, 68.2% had a Bachelor's degree or higher.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness and managerial occupations were second with 97.8% having graduated from high school, 79.5% having some college or an associate degree and just over half, 53.4% having a Bachelor's degree or higher. While nearly all employment fields feature a population where over 80% had graduated from high school with over a third having some college education or an Associate degree, the fields relating to agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and transportation did not. These, often described as blue collar, fields featured a labor force where less than a tenth of the population had a Bachelor's degree or higher, less than half had some college or an Associates, and less than 80% had graduated from high school.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the least educated occupational field was agriculture, ranking last on all educational levels. Here 55.4% had graduated from high school, roughly one fifth (20.8%) had some college education or an associate degree and 6.8% had a Bachelor's degree or higher. While the largest occupational field, that consisting of professionals and relating occupations was also the largest field, the fields with lower educational attainment combined were larger than the professional and managerial fields combined. Overall, 38.02% were employed in the professional and managerial fields while 61.89% were employed in the other white and blue collar fields were those with a bachelor's degree or higher constituted less than a third of the work force.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nEducational attainment among the population aged 25 and above varied rather slightly with geography region. The population of the Northeastern United States, which had the smallest population of any region with thirty-six million residents, had the highest percentage of high-school and college graduates. The western United States had the highest percentage of those with some college or an associate degree and ranked second for college graduates. The South which had by far the largest population with roughly sixty-six million people had the lowest educational attainment at every level.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proportion of high school graduates was the largest in the Midwest while the proportion of those with some college or an associate degree was the second and that of those with a Bachelor's degree or higher was the third largest of any region.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducational attainment is one of the primary indicators of social class in the United States.[26] While the American social class system is a vaguely defined concept with many contradicting theories,[27][28] educational attainment emerges as one of the top assessments of social class. Not only is a high educational attainment a status symbol by itself, but it is also very closely related to the other two main indicators of social class: occupation and income. A graduate degree and the roughly seven to eight years of post-secondary education serve as the main requirement for entering the \\"professions\\" and becoming part of the professional middle class.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation is a major key in becoming a more privileged member of the American middle class.[26][28] Overall, educational attainment is the main entrance barrier into more privileged parts of the middle class as it is not only of high value but is also the requirement for becoming a professional and earning the corresponding income.[26] This corresponding income is typically significantly higher than that of someone without this higher level of educational attainment in the United States. Exceptions include some entrepreneurs who can rank anywhere in the class system but are usually not referred to as professional middle class unless they are of the professions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, it is also important to differentiate between the statistical middle class, often defined as consisting of those who are neither rich nor poor, and the professional middle class. Recent research has shown that not only is the statistical middle of society (those with income roughly 80% to 120% of the national median or members of the mid-quintile) no longer able to afford the lifestyle indicative of the middle class,[29] but there also seems to be a widening income gap in between those who may be described as being middle class.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation is not only the main requirement for becoming a member of the professional middle class, it is also key to a comfortable lifestyle and economic security.[26] Those in the statistical middle may have to fear lay-offs and cost-cutting downsizing as well as out-sourcing, while some of those in the professional middle class are less subject to economic fluctuations and are more likely to enjoy upper-middle range incomes even in the face of recessions. Increasingly however even the professional middle class is facing lay-offs and job elimination due to downsizing and replacement of full-time workers with part-time workersthis is particularly evident in colleges and universities where, by 2009, half of the faculty were part-time; another 25% were full-time but with short-term contracts, thus showing that advanced education is not necessarily associated with high salaries and economic stability.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany scholars have studied educational attainment in the US as a form of social reproduction and stratification. In 1977, Pierre Bourdieu presented the idea that education leads to social reproduction and a stratified society by honoring the cultural capital of elite classes. Students who possess the valued cultural capital, according to Bourdieu, are rewarded with high academic achievement.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen elite class members enter the workforce, they are channeled into high paying jobs and powerful positions within society, while those who did not achieve the same level of academic success fall into subordinate occupations and status levels. By rewarding the desired cultural capital with high academic achievement, upper classes are able and prepared to reach higher levels of educational attainment. Members of the working class, on the other hand, are not rewarded for their cultural capital in schools, and are instead socialized for working class jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnette Lareau also addresses the factors that lead to social stratification in educational attainment. Lareau's idea of concerted cultivation refers to an active involvement of parents in a child's learning and development experiences by creating and controlling organized activities for their children. According to Lareau, middle-class parents engage in concerted cultivation to teach their children, while lower- and working-class parents do not. Laureau further explains that schools firmly encourage and expect parents to use concerted cultivation as a child-rearing strategy.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe child-rearing practices of lower- and working-class families thus do not comply with the standards of educational institutions. As a result, lower- and working-class students develop a sense of \\"distance, distrust, and constraint\\" in educational institutions, while children of middle-class families gain a sense of entitlement. These differences in child-rearing practices lead to children of lower- and working-class families to lack the necessary life skills that the children of the middle class possess, further isolating them from educational opportunities. In the United States, education attainment typically is viewed as a sign of social status.\\r\\n\\r\\nRandall Collins contributed the idea of credentialism to the study of class-based differences in educational attainment. Collins maintains that public schools are socializing institutions that teach and reward middle-class values of competition and achievement. In this view, elites are selectively separated from other students and placed into prestigious schools and colleges, where they are trained to hold positions of power.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy teaching middle-class culture through the public education system, the elite class ensures a monopoly over positions of power, while others acquire the credentials to compete in a subordinate job market and economy. In this way, schools of medicine, law, and elite institutions have remained closed to members of lower classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"What percent of american adults have a bachelor's degree?"},{"output":"Rio de Janeiro","context":"The current Capital of Brazil (Brasil) is Braslia.

Stevens to call in the U.S. Marines to protect American interests, an action that effectively buttressed the rebellion. The revolutionaries established the Republic of Hawaii, but their ultimate goal was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which finally occurred in 1898.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kamehameha Dynasty was the reigning monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii, beginning with its founding by Kamehameha I in 1795, until the death of Kamehameha V in 1872 and Lunalilo in 1874.[5][6] On July 6, 1846, U.S. Secretary of State John C. Calhoun, on behalf of President Tyler, afforded formal recognition of Hawaiian independence under the reign of Kamehameha III.[7] As a result of the recognition of Hawaiian independence, the Hawaiian Kingdom entered into treaties with the major nations of the world[8] and established over ninety legations and consulates in multiple seaports and cities.[9] The kingdom would continue for another 21 years until its overthrow in 1893 with the fall of the House of Kalkaua.[10]\\r\\nSugar had been a major export from Hawaii since Captain James Cook's arrival in 1778.[11] The first permanent plantation in the islands was on Kauai in 1835. William Hooper leased 980 acres of land from Kamehameha III and began growing sugar cane. Within thirty years there would be plantations on four of the main islands. Sugar had completely altered Hawaii's economy.[12]\\r\\nAmerican influence in Hawaiian government began with American-born plantation owners demanding a say in Kingdom politics. This was driven by missionary religion and the economics of the sugar industry. Pressure from these foreign born politicians was being felt by the King and chiefs with demands of land tenure. After the 1843 takeover by the British, Kamehameha III relented to the foreign advisors to private land demands with the Great Mhele, distributing the lands as pushed on heavily by the missionaries, including Gerrit P. Judd.[13] During the 1850s, the U.S. import tariff on sugar from Hawaii was much higher than the import tariffs Hawaiians were charging the U.S., and Kamehameha III sought reciprocity.[14] The monarch wished to lower the tariffs being paid out to the U.S. while still maintaining the Kingdom's sovereignty and making Hawaiian sugar competitive with other foreign markets. In 1854 Kamehameha III proposed a policy of reciprocity between the countries but the proposal died in the U.S. Senate.[15]\\r\\nAs early as 1873, a United States military commission recommended attempting to obtain Ford Island in exchange for the tax-free importation of sugar to the U.S.[16] Major General John Schofield, U.S. commander of the military division of the Pacific, and Brevet Brigadier General Burton S. Alexander arrived in Hawaii to ascertain its defensive capabilities. American control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of the west coast of the United States, and they were especially interested in Pu'uloa, Pearl Harbor.[17] The sale of one of Hawaii's harbors was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop, a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family, had risen in the government to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and owned a country home near Pu'uloa. He showed the two U.S. officers around the lochs, although his wife, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands. As monarch, William Charles Lunalilo, was content to let Bishop run almost all business affairs but the ceding of lands would become unpopular with the native Hawaiians. Many islanders thought that all the islands, rather than just Pearl Harbor, might be lost and opposed any cession of land. By November 1873, Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking, against his doctor's advice; his health declined swiftly, and he died on February 3, 1874.[17]\\r\\nLunalilo left no heirs. The legislature was empowered by the constitution to elect the monarch in these instances[18] and chose David Kalkaua as the next monarch.[19] The new ruler was pressured by the U.S. government to surrender Pearl Harbor to the Navy.[19] Kalkaua was concerned that this would lead to annexation by the U.S. and to the contravention of the traditions of the Hawaiian people, who believed that the land ('ina) was fertile, sacred, and not for sale to anyone.[19] In 1874 through 1875, Kalkaua traveled to the United States for a state visit to Washington DC to help gain support for a new treaty.[20][21] Congress agreed to the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 for seven years in exchange for Ford Island.[22][23] After the treaty, sugar production expanded from 12,000 acres of farm land to 125,000 acres in 1891.[24] At the end of the seven-year reciprocity agreement, the United States showed little interest in renewal.[22]\\r\\nOn January 20, 1887, the United States began leasing Pearl Harbor.[25] Shortly afterwards, a group of mostly non-Hawaiians calling themselves the Hawaiian Patriotic League began the Rebellion of 1887.[26] They drafted their own constitution on July 6, 1887.[27] The new constitution was written by Lorrin Thurston, the Hawaiian Minister of the Interior who used the Hawaiian militia as threat against Kalkaua.[25] Kalkaua was forced under threat of assassination[28] to dismiss his cabinet ministers and sign a new constitution which greatly lessened his power.[19] It would become known as the \\"Bayonet Constitution\\" due to the force used.[25]\\r\\nThe Bayonet Constitution allowed the monarch to appoint cabinet ministers, but had stripped him of the power to dismiss them without approval from the Legislature.[27]:152 Eligibility to vote for the House of Nobles was also altered, stipulating that both candidates and voters were now required to own property valuing at least three thousand dollars, or have an annual income of no less than six hundred dollars.[29] This resulted in disenfranchising two thirds of the native Hawaiians as well as other ethnic groups who had previously held the right to vote but were no longer able to meet the new voting requirements.[30] This new constitution benefited the white, foreign plantation owners.[31] With the legislature now responsible for naturalizing citizens, Americans and Europeans could retain their home country citizenship and vote as citizens of the kingdom.[32] Along with voting privileges, Americans could now run for office and still retain their American citizenship, something not afforded in any other nation of the world[33] and even allowed Americans to vote without becoming naturalized.[34] Asian immigrants were completely shut out and were no longer able to acquire citizenship or vote at all.[35]\\r\\nThe Wilcox Rebellion of 1888 was a plot to overthrow King David Kalkaua, king of Hawaii, and replace him with his sister in a coup d'tat in response to increased political tension between the legislature and the king after the 1887 constitution. Kalkaua's sister, Princess Lili?uokalani and his wife, Queen Kapiolani, returned from Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee immediately after news reached them in Great Britain.[36]\\r\\nKalkaua's distant cousin, a native Hawaiian officer and veteran of the Italian military, Robert William Wilcox returned to Hawaii at about the same time as Lili?uokalani[37] in October 1887 when the funding for his study program stopped when the new constitution was signed. Wilcox, Charles B. Wilson, Princess Lili?uokalani, and Sam Nowlein plotted to overthrow King Kalkaua to replace him with his sister, Lili?uokalani. They had 300 Hawaiian conspirators hidden in ?Iolani Barracks and an alliance with the Royal Guard, but the plot was accidentally discovered in January 1888, less than 48 hours before the revolt would have been initiated.[38] No one was prosecuted but Wilcox was exiled. So on February 11, 1888, Wilcox left Hawaii for San Francisco, intending to return to Italy with his wife.\\r\\nPrincess Lili?uokalani was offered the throne several times by the Missionary Party who had forced the Bayonet Constitution on her brother, but she believed she would become a powerless figurehead like her brother and rejected the offers outright.[39]\\r\\nIn November 1889, Kalkaua traveled to San Francisco for his health, staying at the Palace Hotel. He died there on January 20, 1890.[40] His sister Lili?uokalani assumed the throne in the middle of an economic crisis. The McKinley Act had crippled the Hawaiian sugar industry by removing the duties on sugar imports from other countries into the US, eliminating the previous Hawaiian advantage gained via the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875.[41] Many Hawaii businesses and citizens felt pressure from the loss of revenue; in response Lili?uokalani proposed a lottery system to raise money for her government. Also proposed was a controversial opium licensing bill.[42] Her ministers, and closest friends, were all opposed to this plan; they unsuccessfully tried to dissuade her from pursuing these initiatives, both of which came to be used against her in the brewing constitutional crisis.[43]\\r\\nLili?uokalani's chief desire was to restore power to the monarch by abrogating the 1887 Bayonet Constitution and promulgating a new one, an idea that seems to have been broadly supported by the Hawaiian population.[44] The 1893 Constitution would have increased suffrage by reducing some property requirements, and eliminated the voting privileges extended to European and American residents. It would have disenfranchised many resident European and American businessmen who were not citizens of Hawaii. The Queen toured several of the islands on horseback, talking to the people about her ideas and receiving overwhelming support, including a lengthy petition in support of a new constitution. However, when the Queen informed her cabinet of her plans, they withheld their support due to an understanding of what her opponents' likely response to these plans would be.[45]\\r\\nThough there were threats to Hawaii's sovereignty throughout the Kingdom's history, it was not until the signing of the Bayonet Constitution in 1887 that this threat began to be realized. The precipitating event[46] leading to the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893, was the attempt by Queen Lili?uokalani to promulgate a new constitution that would have strengthened the power of the monarch relative to the legislature, where Euro-American business elites held disproportionate power. The stated goals of the conspirators, who were non-native Hawaiian Kingdom subjects (five American nationals, one English national, and one German national)[47] were to depose the queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii's annexation to the United States.[48][49]\\r\\nThe overthrow itself was started by newspaper publisher Lorrin Thurston, a Hawaiian subject and former Minister of the Interior who was the grandson of American missionaries,[50] and formally led by the Chairman of the Committee of Safety, Henry E. Cooper, an American lawyer. They derived their support primarily from the American and European business class residing in Hawaii and other supporters of the Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Most of the leaders of the Committee of Safety that deposed the queen were American and European citizens who were also Kingdom subjects.[51][52][53] They included legislators, government officers, and a Supreme Court Justice of the Hawaiian Kingdom.[54]\\r\\nOn January 16, the Marshal of the Kingdom, Charles B. Wilson was tipped off by detectives to the imminent planned overthrow. Wilson requested warrants to arrest the 13-member council of the Committee of Safety, and put the Kingdom under martial law. Because the members had strong political ties with United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, the requests were repeatedly denied by Attorney General Arthur P. Peterson and the Queens cabinet, fearing if approved, the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with Thurston,[55] Wilson began to collect his men for the confrontation. Wilson and Captain of the Royal Household Guard, Samuel Nowlein, had rallied a force of 496 men who were kept at hand to protect the Queen.[2]\\r\\nThe events began on January 17, 1893, when John Good, a revolutionist, shot Leialoha, a native policeman who was trying to stop a wagon carrying weapons to the Honolulu Rifles, the paramilitary wing of the Committee of Safety led by Lorrin Thurston.[56] The Committee of Safety feared the shooting would bring government forces to rout out the conspirators and stop the overthrow before it could begin. The Committee of Safety initiated the overthrow by organizing the Honolulu Rifles, consisting of approximately 1,500 armed local (non-native) men, under their leadership, intending to depose Queen Lili?uokalani. The Rifles garrisoned Ali'iolani Hale across the street from ?Iolani Palace and waited for the Queen's response.[49]\\r\\nAs these events were unfolding, the Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American residents in Honolulu.[57]\\r\\nOn January 17, 1893, the Chairman of the Committee of Safety, Henry E. Cooper, addressed a crowd assembled in front of ?Iolani Palace (the official royal residence) and read aloud a proclamation that formally deposed Queen Lili?uokalani, abolished the Hawaiian monarchy, and established a Provisional Government of Hawaii under President Sanford B. Dole.\\r\\nThe overthrow efforts were supported by United States Government Minister John L. Stevens with an invasion of U.S. Marines, who came ashore at the request of the conspirators.[58] Advised about supposed threats to non-combatant American lives and property[59] by the Committee of Safety, Stevens obliged their request and summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the USS Boston and 162 sailors to land on the Kingdom under orders of neutrality and take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate, and Arion Hall on the afternoon of January 16, 1893.[60]\\r\\nThe overthrow left the queen imprisoned in ?Iolani Palace under house arrest. The American sailors and Marines did not enter the Palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence served effectively in intimidating royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, \\"the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.\\"[61] Due to the Queen's desire \\"to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life\\" for her subjects and after some deliberation, at the urging of advisers and friends, the Queen ordered her forces to surrender. The Honolulu Rifles took over government buildings, disarmed the Royal Guard, and declared a provisional government.[49]\\r\\nAccording to the Queen's Book, her friend and minister J. S. Walker \\"came and told me that he had come on a painful duty, that the opposition party had requested that I should abdicate.\\" After consulting with her ministers, including Walker, the Queen concluded that \\"since the troops of the United States had been landed to support the revolutionists, by the order of the American minister, it would be impossible for us to make any resistance\\".[62]:387 Despite repeated claims that the overthrow was \\"bloodless\\", the Queen's Book notes that Lili?uokalani received \\"friends [who] expressed their sympathy in person; amongst these Mrs. J. S. Walker, who had lost her husband by the treatment he received from the hands of the insurgents. He was one of many who from persecution had succumbed to death.\\"[62]:296\\r\\nImmediate annexation was prevented by the speech given by President Grover Cleveland to Congress at this time, in which he stated that:\\r\\n... the military demonstration upon the soil of Honolulu was of itself an act of war; unless made either with the consent of the government of Hawaii or for the bona fide purpose of protecting the imperiled lives and property of citizens of the United States. But there is no pretense of any such consent on the part of the government of the queen?... the existing government, instead of requesting the presence of an armed force, protested against it. There is as little basis for the pretense that forces were landed for the security of American life and property. If so, they would have been stationed in the vicinity of such property and so as to protect it, instead of at a distance and so as to command the Hawaiian Government Building and palace?... When these armed men were landed, the city of Honolulu was in its customary orderly and peaceful condition?...[63]\\r\\nThe Republic of Hawaii was nonetheless declared in 1894 by the same parties which had established the provisional government. Among them were Lorrin A. Thurston, a drafter of the Bayonet Constitution, and Sanford Dole who appointed himself President of the forcibly instated Republic on July 4, 1894.\\r\\nA provisional government was set up with the strong support of the Honolulu Rifles, a militia group who had defended the system of government promulgated by the Bayonet Constitution against the Wilcox rebellion of 1889.[49]\\r\\nThe Queen's statement yielding authority, on January 17, 1893, protested the overthrow:\\r\\nI Lili?uokalani, by the Grace of God and under the Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Queen, do hereby solemnly protest against any and all acts done against myself and the Constitutional Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom by certain persons claiming to have established a Provisional Government of and for this Kingdom.\\r\\nThat I yield to the superior force of the United States of America whose Minister Plenipotentiary, His Excellency John L. Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu and declared that he would support the Provisional Government.\\r\\nNow to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life, I do this under protest and impelled by said force yield my authority until such time as the Government of the United States shall, upon facts being presented to it, undo the action of its representatives and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the Constitutional Sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands.[64]\\r\\nOn December 19, 1898 the queen would amend the declaration with the \\"Memorial of Queen Liliuokalani in relation to the Crown lands of Hawaii\\", further protesting the overthrow and loss of property.[65]\\r\\nNewly inaugurated President Grover Cleveland called for an investigation into the overthrow. This investigation was conducted by former Congressman James Henderson Blount. Blount concluded in his report on July 17, 1893, \\"United States diplomatic and military representatives had abused their authority and were responsible for the change in government.\\"[66] Minister Stevens was recalled, and the military commander of forces in Hawai?i was forced to resign his commission.[citation needed] President Cleveland stated, \\"Substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard for our national character as well as the rights of the injured people requires we should endeavor to repair the monarchy.\\" Cleveland further stated in his 1893 State of the Union Address that, \\"Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable course for our Government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible intervention.\\"[63] The matter was referred by Cleveland to Congress on December 18, 1893, after the Queen refused to accept amnesty for the traitors as a condition of reinstatement. Hawaii President Sanford Dole was presented a demand for reinstatement by Minister Willis, who had not realized Cleveland had already sent the matter to CongressDole flatly refused Cleveland's demands to reinstate the Queen.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Senator John Tyler Morgan (D-Alabama) and composed mostly of senators in favor of annexation, initiated their own investigation to discredit Blount's earlier report, using pro-annexationist affidavits from Hawaii, and testimony provided to the U.S. Senate in Washington, D.C. Not surprisingly, the Morgan Report contradicted the Blount Report, and exonerated Minister Stevens and the U.S. military troops finding them \\"not guilty\\" of involvement in the overthrow. Cleveland became stalled with his earlier efforts to restore the queen, and adopted a position of recognition of the so-called Provisional Government and the Republic of Hawaii which followed.[67][68]\\r\\nThe Native Hawaiian Study Commission of the United States Congress in its 1983 final report found no historical, legal, or moral obligation for the U.S. government to provide reparations, assistance, or group rights to Native Hawaiians.[69]\\r\\nIn 1993, the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Congress passed a resolution, which President Bill Clinton signed into law, offering an apology to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the United States for its involvement in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This law is known as the Apology Resolution.\\r\\nEvery government with a diplomatic presence in Hawaii, except for the United Kingdom, recognized the Provisional Government within 48 hours of the overthrow via their consulates. Countries recognizing the new Provisional Government included Chile, Austria-Hungary, Mexico, Russia, the Netherlands, Imperial Germany, Sweden, Spain, Imperial Japan,[70] Italy, Portugal, Denmark, Belgium, China, Peru, and France.[71] When the Republic of Hawaii was declared on July 4, 1894, immediate de facto recognition was given by every nation with diplomatic relations with Hawaii, except for Britain, whose response came in November 1894.[72]\\r\\nA four-day uprising between January 6 and 9, 1895, began with an attempted coup d'tat to restore the monarchy, and included battles between Royalists and the republican rebels. Later, after a weapons cache was found on the palace grounds after the attempted rebellion in 1895, Queen Lili?uokalani was placed under arrest, tried by a military tribunal of the Republic of Hawai?i, convicted of misprision of treason and imprisoned in her own home. On January 24, Lili?uokalani abdicated, formally ending the Hawaiian monarchy.[73]\\r\\nThe Committee of Safety declared Sanford Dole to be President of the new Provisional Government of the Kingdom of Hawai?i on January 17, 1893, removing only the Queen, her cabinet, and her marshal from office.[74]:581ÿ587 On July 4, 1894, the Republic of Hawai?i was proclaimed. Dole was president of both governments. As a republic, it was the intention of the government to campaign for annexation with the United States of America. The rationale behind annexation included a strong economic componentHawaiian goods and services exported to the mainland would not be subject to American tariffs, and would benefit from domestic bounties, if Hawaii was part of the United States.[74]:649ÿ650\\r\\nIn 1897, William McKinley succeeded Cleveland as president. A year later he signed the Newlands Resolution, which provided for the annexation of Hawaii on July 7, 1898. The formal ceremony marking the annexation was held at Iolani Palace on August 12, 1898. Almost no Native Hawaiians attended, and those few who were on the streets wore royalist ilima blossoms in their hats or hair, and, on their breasts Hawaiian flags with the motto: Kuu Hae Aloha (\\"my beloved flag\\").[75] Most of the 40,000 Native Hawaiians, including Lili?uokalani and the royal family, shuttered themselves in their homes, protesting what they considered an illegal transaction. \\"When the news of Annexation came it was bitterer than death to me\\", Lili?uokalani's niece, Princess Ka?iulani, told the San Francisco Chronicle. \\"It was bad enough to lose the throne, but infinitely worse to have the flag go down.\\"[76] The Hawaiian flag was lowered for the last time while the Royal Hawaiian Band played the Hawaiian national anthem, Hawai?i Pono?ؐ.\\r\\nThe Hawaiian Islands, together with the distant Palmyra Island and Stewart Islands, became the Territory of Hawaii, a United States territory, with a new government established on February 22, 1900. Sanford Dole was appointed as the first governor.[77] ?Iolani Palace served as the capitol of the Hawaiian government until 1969.","input":"When was hawaii annexed into the united states?"},{"output":"transmits visual information from the retina to the brain","context":"The optic nerve, also known as cranial nerve II, is a paired nerve that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. In humans, the optic nerve is derived from optic stalks during the seventh week of development and is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glial cells; it extends from the optic disc to the optic chiasma and continues as the optic tract to the lateral geniculate nucleus, pretectal nuclei, and superior colliculus.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe optic nerve is the second of twelve paired cranial nerves and is technically part of the central nervous system, rather than the peripheral nervous system because it is derived from an out-pouching of the diencephalon (optic stalks) during embryonic development. As a consequence, the fibers of the optic nerve are covered with myelin produced by oligodendrocytes, rather than Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system, and are encased within the meninges. Peripheral neuropathies like GuillainÿBarr syndrome do not affect the optic nerve. However, most typically the optic nerve is grouped with the other eleven cranial nerves and considered to be part of the peripheral nervous system.\\r\\nThe optic nerve is ensheathed in all three meningeal layers (dura, arachnoid, and pia mater) rather than the epineurium, perineurium, and endoneurium found in peripheral nerves. Fiber tracts of the mammalian central nervous system (as opposed to the peripheral nervous system) are incapable of regeneration, and, hence, optic nerve damage produces irreversible blindness. The fibres from the retina run along the optic nerve to nine primary visual nuclei in the brain, from which a major relay inputs into the primary visual cortex.\\r\\nThe optic nerve is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glial cells. Each human optic nerve contains between 770,000 and 1.7 million nerve fibers,[3] which are axons of the retinal ganglion cells of one retina. In the fovea, which has high acuity, these ganglion cells connect to as few as 5 photoreceptor cells; in other areas of retina, they connect to many thousand photoreceptors.\\r\\nThe optic nerve leaves the orbit (eye socket) via the optic canal, running postero-medially towards the optic chiasm, where there is a partial decussation (crossing) of fibres from the temporal visual fields (the nasal hemi-retina) of both eyes. The proportion of decussating fibers varies between species, and is correlated with the degree of binocular vision enjoyed by a species.[4] Most of the axons of the optic nerve terminate in the lateral geniculate nucleus from where information is relayed to the visual cortex, while other axons terminate in the pretectal nucleus and are involved in reflexive eye movements. Other axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. Its diameter increases from about 1.6?mm within the eye to 3.5?mm in the orbit to 4.5?mm within the cranial space. The optic nerve component lengths are 1?mm in the globe, 24?mm in the orbit, 9?mm in the optic canal, and 16?mm in the cranial space before joining the optic chiasm. There, partial decussation occurs, and about 53% of the fibers cross to form the optic tracts. Most of these fibres terminate in the lateral geniculate body.[1]\\r\\nBased on this anatomy, the optic nerve may be divided in the four parts as indicated in the image at the top of this section (this view is from above as if you were looking into the orbit after the top of the skull had been removed): 1. the optic head (which is where it begins in the eyeball (globe) with fibers from the retina; 2. orbital part (which is the part within the orbit). 3. intracanicular part (which is the part within a bony canal known as the optic canal); and, 4. cranial part (the part within the cranial cavity, which ends at the optic chiasm).[2]\\r\\nFrom the lateral geniculate body, fibers of the optic radiation pass to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe of the brain. In more specific terms, fibers carrying information from the contralateral superior visual field traverse Meyer's loop to terminate in the lingual gyrus below the calcarine fissure in the occipital lobe, and fibers carrying information from the contralateral inferior visual field terminate more superiorly, to the cuneus[citation needed].\\r\\nThe optic nerve transmits all visual information including brightness perception, color perception and contrast (visual acuity). It also conducts the visual impulses that are responsible for two important neurological reflexes: the light reflex and the accommodation reflex. The light reflex refers to the constriction of both pupils that occurs when light is shone into either eye; the accommodation reflex refers to the swelling of the lens of eye that occurs when one looks at a near object as in reading (lens adjusts to near vision).[1]\\r\\nThe eye's blind spot is a result of the absence of photoreceptors in the area of the retina where the optic nerve leaves the eye.[1]\\r\\nDamage to the optic nerve typically causes permanent and potentially severe loss of vision, as well as an abnormal pupillary reflex, which is diagnostically important. The type of visual field loss will depend on which portions of the optic nerve were damaged. In general:\\r\\nInjury to the optic nerve can be the result of congenital or inheritable problems like Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, glaucoma, trauma, toxicity, inflammation, ischemia, infection (very rarely), or compression from tumors or aneurysms. By far, the three most common injuries to the optic nerve are from glaucoma, optic neuritis (especially in those younger than 50 years of age), and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (usually in those older than 50).\\r\\nGlaucoma is a group of diseases involving loss of retinal ganglion cells causing optic neuropathy in a pattern of peripheral vision loss, initially sparing central vision. Glaucoma is associated with increased intraocular pressure that damages the optic nerve as it exits the eyeball. Although glaucoma does eventually damage the optic nerve, it is primarily a disease of eye not of the nerve.\\r\\nOptic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve. It is associated with a number of diseases, the most notable one being multiple sclerosis. The patient will likely experience varying vision loss and eye pain. The condition tends to be episodic.\\r\\nAnterior ischemic optic neuropathy is commonly known as \\"stroke of the optic nerve\\" and affects the optic nerve head. There is usually a sudden loss of blood supply and nutrients to the optic nerve head (where the nerve exits the eyeball). Vision loss is typically sudden and most commonly occurs upon waking up in the morning. This condition is most common in diabetic patients 40ÿ70 years old.\\r\\nOptic nerve hypoplasia is the underdevelopment of the optic nerve resulting in little to no vision in the affected eye.\\r\\nTumors, especially those of the pituitary gland, can put pressure on the optic nerve causing various forms of visual loss. Similarly, cerebral aneurysms (swelling of blood vessels) can also affect the nerve.\\r\\nTrauma can cause serious injury to the nerve. Direct optic nerve injury can occur from a penetrating injury to the orbit, but the nerve can also be injured by indirect trauma in which severe head impact or movement stretches or even tears the nerve [1]\\r\\nOphthalmologists and optometrists can detect and diagnose some optic nerve diseases but neuro-ophthalmologists are often best suited to diagnose and treat diseases of the optic nerve.\\r\\nThe International Foundation for Optic Nerve Diseases (IFOND) sponsors research and provides information on a variety of optic nerve disorders.\\r\\nSimilar to other CNS tracts, the optic has very limited regenerative potential after injury. However, some new techniques are being developed to increase this potential.[5]\\r\\nMRI scan of human eye showing optic nerve.\\r\\nThe ophthalmic artery and its branches.

It is especially interested in the dynamic relations between conscious motivation and unconscious motivation.[1]\\r\\nThe term psychodynamics is also used by some to refer specifically to the psychoanalytical approach developed by Sigmund Freud (1856ÿ1939) and his followers. Freud was inspired by the theory of thermodynamics and used the term psychodynamics to describe the processes of the mind as flows of psychological energy (libido) in an organically complex brain.[2]\\r\\nThere are 4 different schools of thought regarding psychological treatment: Psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, biological, and humanistic treatment. In the treatment of psychological distress, psychodynamic psychotherapy tends to be a less intensive, once- or twice-weekly modality than the classical Freudian psychoanalysis treatment of 3-5 sessions per week. Psychodynamic therapies depend upon a theory of inner conflict, wherein repressed behaviours and emotions surface into the patients consciousness; generally, one's conflict is subconscious.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, psychodynamics is the study of the interrelationship of various parts of the mind, personality, or psyche as they relate to mental, emotional, or motivational forces especially at the unconscious level.[4][5][6] The mental forces involved in psychodynamics are often divided into two parts:[7] (a) the interaction of the emotional and motivational forces that affect behavior and mental states, especially on a subconscious level; (b) inner forces affecting behavior: the study of the emotional and motivational forces that affect behavior and states of mind.\\r\\nFreud proposed that psychological energy was constant (hence, emotional changes consisted only in displacements) and that it tended to rest (point attractor) through discharge (catharsis).[8]\\r\\nIn mate selection psychology, psychodynamics is defined as the study of the forces, motives, and energy generated by the deepest of human needs.[9]\\r\\nIn general, psychodynamics studies the transformations and exchanges of \\"psychic energy\\" within the personality.[5] A focus in psychodynamics is the connection between the energetics of emotional states in the Id, ego and super-ego as they relate to early childhood developments and processes. At the heart of psychological processes, according to Freud, is the ego, which he envisions as battling with three forces: the id, the super-ego, and the outside world.[4] The id is the unconscious reservoir of libido, the psychic energy that fuels instincts and psychic processes. The ego serves as the general manager of personality, making decisions regarding the pleasures that will be pursued at the id's demand, the person's safety requirements, and the moral dictates of the superego that will be followed. The superego refers to the repository of an individual's moral values, divided into the conscience - the internalization of a society's rules and regulations - and the ego-ideal - the internalization of one's goals.[10] Hence, the basic psychodynamic model focuses on the dynamic interactions between the id, ego, and superego.[11] Psychodynamics, subsequently, attempts to explain or interpret behaviour or mental states in terms of innate emotional forces or processes.\\r\\nFreud used the term psychodynamics to describe the processes of the mind as flows of psychological energy (libido) in an organically complex brain.[2] The idea for this came from his first year adviser, Ernst von Brcke at the University of Vienna, who held the view that all living organisms, including humans, are basically energy-systems to which the principle of the conservation of energy applies.[12] This principle states that \\"the total amount of energy in any given physical system is always constant, that energy quanta can be changed but not annihilated, and that consequently when energy is moved from one part of the system, it must reappear in another part.\\"[12] This principle is at the very root of Freud's ideas, whereby libido, which is primarily seen as sexual energy, is transformed into other behaviours. However, it is now clear that the term energy in physics means something quite different from the term energy in relation to mental functioning.\\r\\nPsychodynamics was initially further developed by Carl Jung, Alfred Adler and Melanie Klein.[5][6] By the mid-1940s and into the 1950s, the general application of the \\"psychodynamic theory\\" had been well established.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn his 1988 book Introduction to Psychodynamics - a New Synthesis, psychiatrist Mardi J. Horowitz states that his own interest and fascination with psychodynamics began during the 1950s, when he heard Ralph Greenson, a popular local psychoanalyst who spoke to the public on topics such as \\"People who Hate\\", speak on the radio at UCLA. In his radio discussion, according to Horowitz, he \\"vividly described neurotic behavior and unconscious mental processes and linked psychodynamics theory directly to everyday life.\\"[13]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, American psychiatrist Eric Berne built on Freud's psychodynamic model, particularly that of the \\"ego states\\", to develop a psychology of human interactions called transactional analysis[14] which, according to physician James R. Allen, is a \\"cognitive behavioral approach to treatment and that it is a very effective way of dealing with internal models of self and others as well as other psychodynamic issues.\\"[14] The theory was popularized in the 1964 book Games People Play, a book that sold five million copies, giving way to such catch phrases as \\"Boy, has he got your number!\\"[citation needed].\\r\\nEarly researchers in France set the scene for the psychodynamic approach. Jean-Martin Charcot, for example, lectured on Mesmerism or Hypnosis, ideas that Sigmund Freud, who attended his lectures, would later take up.\\r\\nWilliam James was an early user of the term 'subconscious mind'. His student Boris Sidis published books on topics that formed the foundation for much of Freud's work; he, however, employed the terms 'unconscious' and sometimes 'preconscious'.\\r\\nAccording to American psychologist Calvin S. Hall, from his 1954 Primer in Freudian Psychology:\\r\\nAt the heart of psychological processes, according to Freud, is the ego, which he sees battling with three forces: the id, the super-ego, and the outside world.[4] Hence, the basic psychodynamic model focuses on the dynamic interactions between the id, ego, and superego.[11] Psychodynamics, subsequently, attempts to explain or interpret behavior or mental states in terms of innate emotional forces or processes. In his writings about the \\"engines of human behavior\\", Freud used the German word Trieb, a word that can be translated into English as either instinct or drive.[15]\\r\\nIn the 1930s, Freud's daughter Anna Freud began to apply Freud's psychodynamic theories of the \\"ego\\" to the study of parent-child attachment and especially deprivation and in doing so developed ego psychology.\\r\\nAt the turn of the 20th century, during these decisive years, a young Swiss psychiatrist named Carl Jung had been following Freuds writings and had sent him copies of his articles and his first book, the 1907 Psychology of Dementia Praecox, in which he upheld the Freudian psychodynamic viewpoint, although with some reservations. That year, Freud invited Jung to visit him in Vienna. The two men, it is said, were greatly attracted to each other, and they talked continuously for thirteen hours. This led to a professional relationship in which they corresponded on a weekly basis, for a period of six years.[16]\\r\\nCarl Jung's contributions in psychodynamic psychology include:\\r\\nJohn Bowlby was originally a follower of the Freudian tradition at the Tavistock Clinic in London, but broke away from Freud's key ideas and revolutionised the field. Bowlby's inspiration came from reading the work of Konrad Lorenz, the famous Nobel Prizeÿwinning founder of the field of ethology or animal behaviour. In particular Bowlby was struck by the phenomenon of imprinting, which Lorenz had studied in birds, and he saw the possibility that infants might imprint on their mother in a similar way. Along with his student Mary Ainsworth he studied infant behaviour, and developed what he called attachment theory. He rejected Freud's ideas of damage caused by frustrated impulses, in favour of the idea that maternal deprivation is a major cause of disturbed development and later psychological problems. Later he realised that infants need a stable, safe person or persons to provide a feeling of security from which they can venture out and explore. Many other workers in the field have since carried out experiments on infants and on animals which seem to confirm and refine this idea.[18]\\r\\nBowlby's attachment theory is widely considered to be the basis of most current research, and to have put the field formerly known as psychoanalysis on a more scientifically based, experimentally testable, footing.[18] Bowlby's work led to a major change in hospital practice in the UK, where children admitted to hospital had not been allowed visits from parents during their stay. Contact with parents was said to unsettle the children and interfere with ward routine. Today, parents are encouraged to stay with their children in UK hospitals, or visit whenever they want.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt present, psychodynamics is an evolving multi-disciplinary field which analyzes and studies human thought process, response patterns, and influences. Research in this field provides insights into a number of areas, including:[19]\\r\\nHutchinson, E.(ED.) (2017).Essentials of human behavior: Integrating person, environment, and the life course.

As a result, many Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance.[47] Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity.[48]\\r\\nEnglish-speakers, and even speakers of many other languages, typically use the term \\"American\\" to exclusively mean people of the United States; this developed from its original use to differentiate English people of the American colonies from English people of England.[49] The word \\"American\\" can also refer to people from the Americas in general[50] (see Names for United States citizens).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of Americans or their ancestors immigrated to America or are descended from people who were brought as slaves within the past five centuries, with the exception of the Native American population and people from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippine Islands who became American through expansion of the country in the 19th century,[51] and American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands in the 20th century.[52]\\r\\nDespite its multi-ethnic composition,[53][54] the culture of the United States held in common by most Americans can also be referred to as mainstream American culture, a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of Northern and Western European colonists, settlers, and immigrants.[53] It also includes influences of African-American culture.[55] Westward expansion integrated the Creoles and Cajuns of Louisiana and the Hispanos of the Southwest and brought close contact with the culture of Mexico. Large-scale immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from Southern and Eastern Europe introduced a variety of elements. Immigration from Asia, Africa, and Latin America has also had impact. A cultural melting pot, or pluralistic salad bowl, describes the way in which generations of Americans have celebrated and exchanged distinctive cultural characteristics.[53]\\r\\nIn addition to the United States, Americans and people of American descent can be found internationally. As many as seven million Americans are estimated to be living abroad, and make up the American diaspora.[56][57][58]\\r\\nThe United States of America is a diverse country, racially, and ethnically.[61] Six races are officially recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau for statistical purposes: White, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and people of two or more races. \\"Some other race\\" is also an option in the census and other surveys.[62][63][64]\\r\\nThe United States Census Bureau also classifies Americans as \\"Hispanic or Latino\\" and \\"Not Hispanic or Latino\\", which identifies Hispanic and Latino Americans as a racially diverse ethnicity that comprises the largest minority group in the nation.[62][63][65]\\r\\nPeople of European descent, or White Americans (also referred to as Caucasian Americans), constitute the majority of the 308 million people living in the United States, with 72.4% of the population in the 2010 United States Census.[a][59][67] They are considered people who trace their ancestry to the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.[59] Of those reporting to be White American, 7,487,133 reported to be Multiracial; with largest combination being white and black.[67] Additionally, there are 29,184,290 White Hispanics or Latinos.[67] Non-Hispanic Whites are the majority in 46 states. There are four minority-majority states: California, Texas, New Mexico, and Hawaii.[59] In addition, the District of Columbia has a non-white majority.[59] The state with the highest percentage of non-Hispanic White Americans is Maine.[68]\\r\\nThe largest continental ancestral group of Americans are that of Europeans who have origins in any of the original peoples of Europe. This includes people via African, North American, Caribbean, Central American or South American and Oceanian nations that have a large European diaspora.[69]\\r\\nThe Spanish were the first Europeans to establish a continuous presence in what is now the United States.[70] Martn de Argelles born 1566, San Agustn, La Florida, was the first person of European descent born in what is now the United States.[71] Twenty-one years later, Virginia Dare born 1587 Roanoke Island in present-day North Carolina, was the first child born in the Thirteen Colonies to English parents.\\r\\nIn the 2014 American Community Survey, German Americans (14.4%), Irish Americans (10.4%), English Americans (7.6%) and Italian Americans (5.4%) were the four largest self-reported European ancestry groups in the United States forming 37.8% of the total population.[72] However, the English-Americans and British-Americans demography is considered a serious under-count as the stock tend to self-report and identify as simply 'Americans' due to the length of time they have inhabited America.[73][74][75][76]\\r\\nOverall, as the largest group, European Americans have the lowest poverty rate[77] and the second highest educational attainment levels, median household income,[78] and median personal income[79] of any racial demographic in the nation.\\r\\nHispanic or Latino Americans (of any race) constitute the largest ethnic minority in the United States. They form the second largest group after non-Hispanic Whites in the United States, comprising 16.3% of the population according to the 2010 United States Census.[b][83][84]\\r\\nHispanic/Latino Americans are very racially diverse, and as a result form an ethnic category, rather than a race.[85][86][87][88]\\r\\nPeople of Spanish or Hispanic descent have lived in what is now the United States since the founding of St. Augustine, Florida in 1565 by Pedro Menndez de Avils. In the State of Texas, Spaniards first settled the region in the late 1600s and formed a unique cultural group known as Tejanos (Texanos).\\r\\nBlack and African Americans are citizens and residents of the United States with origins in Sub-Saharan Africa.[91] According to the Office of Management and Budget, the grouping includes individuals who self-identify as African American, as well as persons who emigrated from nations in the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa.[92] The grouping is thus based on geography, and may contradict or misrepresent an individual's self-identification since not all immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa are \\"Black\\". Among these racial outliers are persons from Cape Verde, Madagascar, various Arab states and Hamito-Semitic populations in East Africa and the Sahel, and the Afrikaners of Southern Africa.[91]\\r\\nAfrican Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans, and formerly as American Negroes) are citizens or residents of the United States who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa.[93] According to the 2009 American Community Survey, there were 38,093,725 Black and African Americans in the United States, representing 12.4% of the population. In addition, there were 37,144,530 non-Hispanic blacks, which comprised 12.1% of the population.[94] This number increased to 42 million according to the 2010 United States Census, when including Multiracial African Americans,[92] making up 14% of the total U.S. population.[c][95] Black and African Americans make up the second largest group in the United States, but the third largest group after White Americans and Hispanic or Latino Americans (of any race).[83] The majority of the population (55%) lives in the South; compared to the 2000 Census, there has also been a decrease of African Americans in the Northeast and Midwest.[95]\\r\\nMost African Americans are the direct descendants of captives from West Africa, who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present United States.[96] As an adjective, the term is usually spelled African-American.[97] The first West African slaves were brought to Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The English settlers treated these captives as indentured servants and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually replaced by the system of race-based slavery used in the Caribbean.[98] All the American colonies had slavery, but it was usually the form of personal servants in the North (where 2% of the people were slaves), and field hands in plantations in the South (where 25% were slaves);[99] by the beginning of the American Revolutionary War 1/5th of the total population was enslaved.[100] During the revolution, some would serve in the Continental Army or Continental Navy,[101][102] while others would serve the British Empire in Lord Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment, and other units.[103] By 1804, the northern states (north of the MasonÿDixon line) had abolished slavery.[104] However, slavery would persist in the southern states until the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.[105] Following the end of the Reconstruction Era, which saw the first African American representation in Congress,[106] African Americans became disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws,[107] legislation that would persist until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act due to the Civil Rights Movement.[108]\\r\\nAccording to US Census Bureau data, very few African immigrants self-identify as African American. On average, less than 5% of African residents self-reported as \\"African American\\" or \\"Afro-American\\" on the 2000 US Census. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants (~95%) identified instead with their own respective ethnicities. Self-designation as \\"African American\\" or \\"Afro-American\\" was highest among individuals from West Africa (4%-9%), and lowest among individuals from Cape Verde, East Africa and Southern Africa (0%-4%).[109] African immigrants may also experience conflict with African Americans.[110]\\r\\nAnother significant population is the Asian American population, comprising 17.3?million in 2010, or 5.6% of the U.S. population.[d][111][112] California is home to 5.6?million Asian Americans, the greatest number in any state.[113] In Hawaii, Asian Americans make up the highest proportion of the population (57 percent).[113] Asian Americans live across the country, yet are heavily urbanized, with significant populations in the Greater Los Angeles Area, New York metropolitan area, and the San Francisco Bay Area.[114]\\r\\nThey are by no means a monolithic group. The largest sub-groups are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from Cambodia, Mainland China, India, Japan, Korea, Laos, Pakistan, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Asians overall have higher income levels than all other racial groups in the United States, including whites, and the trend appears to be increasing in relation to those groups.[115] Additionally, Asians have a higher education attainment level than all other racial groups in the United States.[116][117] For better or worse, the group has been called a model minority.[118][119][120]\\r\\nWhile Asian Americans have been in what is now the United States since before the Revolutionary War,[121][122][123] relatively large waves of Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese immigration did not begin until the mid-to-late 19th century.[123] Immigration and significant population growth continue to this day.[124] Due to a number of factors, Asian Americans have been stereotyped as \\"perpetual foreigners\\".[125][126]\\r\\nAccording to the American Jewish Archives and the Arab American National Museum, some of the first Middle Easterners and North Africans (viz. Jews and Berbers) arrived in the Americas between the late 15th and mid-16th centuries.[127][128][129][130] Many were fleeing ethnic or ethnoreligious persecution during the Spanish Inquisition,[131][132] and a few were also taken to the Americas as slaves.[128]\\r\\nIn 1909, the Superior Court and the Department of Justice in Washington D.C. ruled on a case that redefined Middle Eastern Americans and their racial distinction. According to the Arab American Historical Foundation and the Los Angeles Herald, a case in which George Shishim, a Lebanese policeman, arrested a \\"white\\" man, who claimed that because Shishim was Lebanese, he must not be racially \\"white\\", but rather \\"Chinese-Mongolian\\".[133] Shishim, his attorneys, and the Syrian-Lebanese and Arab American communities rallied to prove that Lebanese, Syrians, and all Arabs and Middle Easterners were in fact \\"white\\" to both gain official citizenship in the United States, as well as avoid other exclusive and restrictive penalties of being labeled as Asian.[134] One of Shishim's arguments appealed to the white justices' desire to connect to their revered religious figure, Jesus. Shishim said: \\"If I am a Mongolian, then so was Jesus, because we came from the same land.\\"[133] As noted in the 1909 publication of the \\"Proceedings of the Asiatic Exclusion League\\", the presiding Judge Hutton concluded that Syrians had descended from Hebrews, who descended from \\"the Semitic family of the 'Indo-Aryan race'\\", but because the Mongol conquerors had killed the Syrian men, and interbred with the Syrian women, \\"western nations have been unable to restore [the Syrians'] original characteristics\\" (6).[135][unreliable source] Shishim won and was granted citizenship, and Middle Easterners were thereafter legally considered \\"white\\" in the United States.\\r\\nHowever, in 1910, Congress passed a bill that defined \\"Armenians, Assyrians, and Jews\\" as \\"Asiatics\\", while still approving their claims to citizenship.[136][unreliable source] This declaration, while not taking away their citizenship, affirmed the ethnic origins and identities of Armenians, Assyrians, and Jews as \\"non-white\\".\\r\\nOver the decades of the 20th century, as more Arab Americans, Jewish Americans and other Middle Eastern ethnic groups settled in the United States, the racial discrimination they faced also increased.[137][138] Due to the ruling in Shishim's case and the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, United States citizens could not sue one another for discrimination if they belonged to \\"the same race\\".[139] However, in 1987, after an Iraqi-American associate professor was refused tenure due to his Arab origins and a synagogue was spray-painted with anti-Semitic insignia, the Supreme Court ruled \\"unanimously today that Arabs, Jews and members of other ethnic groups may sue under a post-Civil War law's broad prohibition against discrimination.\\"[140]\\r\\nAccording to the Pew Research Center's Portrait of Jewish Americans, more than 90% of Jews who responded to their survey described themselves as non-Hispanic whites, 2% as black, 3% as Hispanic, and 2% of other racial or ethnic backgrounds.[141]\\r\\nAdditionally, as modern scientific data improved, more information on the true origins and ethnic distinctions emerged. For example, studies have shown that Jews share more genetic relativity to other Jews around the world than to the surrounding non-Jewish ethnic groups.[142] Some studies have also suggested that other Middle Eastern (non-Jewish) ethnic groups remain one of the closest relations to Jews.[143]\\r\\nThe United States Census Bureau is presently finalizing the ethnic classification of MENA populations. In 2012, prompted in part by post-9/11 discrimination, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee petitioned the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency to designate the MENA populations as a minority/disadvantaged community.[134] Following consultations with MENA organizations, the Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would establish a new MENA ethnic category for populations from the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab world, separate from the \\"white\\" classification that these populations had previously sought in 1909. The expert groups, felt that the earlier \\"white\\" designation no longer accurately represents MENA identity, so they successfully lobbied for a distinct categorization.[144] This process does not currently include Sikhs, as the Bureau only tabulates them as followers of a religion rather than members of ethnic groups.[145]\\r\\nAs of December 2015, the sampling strata for the new MENA category includes the Census Bureau's working classification of 19 MENA groups, as well as Turkish, Sudanese, Djiboutian, Somali, Mauritanian, Armenian, Cypriot, Afghan, Azerbaijani and Georgian groups.[146]\\r\\nAlthough tabulated, \\"religious responses\\" were reported as a single total and not differentiated, despite totaling 1,089,597 in 2000.[147]\\r\\nIndependent organizations provide improved estimates of the total populations of races and ethnicities in the US using the raw data from the US Census and other surveys.\\r\\nFor example, although any respondents who self-identified as Jewish were included under the religious responses in the census, as Jews are an ethnoreligious group with culture and ethnicity intertwined, estimates from the Mandell L. Berman Institute and the North American Jewish Data Bank put the total population of Jews between 5.34 and 6.16?million in 2000 and around 6.54?million in 2010.[149] Similarly, the Arab-American Institute estimated the population of Arab Americans at 3.7?million in 2012.[150]\\r\\nAccording to the Arab American Institute (AAI), countries of origin for Arab Americans include Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.[151] The majority of Arab Americans are Christian.[152][153] Most Maronites tend to be of Lebanese, Syrian, or Cypriot extraction; the majority of Christians of Cypriot and Palestinian background are often Eastern Orthodox.\\r\\nEstimated African MENA populations in the United States:\\r\\nAccording to the 2010 Census, there are 5.2 million people who are Native Americans or Alaska Native alone, or in combination with one or more races; they make up 1.7% of the total population.[e][157] According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), an \\"American Indian or Alaska Native\\" is a person whose ancestry have origins in any of the original peoples of North, Central, or South America.[157] 2.3 million individuals who are American Indian or Alaskan Native are multiracial;[157] additionally the plurality of American Indians reside in the Western United States (40.7%).[157] Collectively and historically this race has been known by several names;[158] as of 1995, 50% of those who fall within the OMB definition prefer the term \\"American Indian\\", 37% prefer \\"Native American\\" and the remainder have no preference or prefer a different term altogether.[159]\\r\\nNative Americans, whose ancestry is indigenous to the Americas, originally migrated to the two continents between 10,000-45,000 years ago.[160] These Paleoamericans spread throughout the two continents and evolved into hundreds of distinct cultures during the pre-Columbian era.[161] Following the first voyage of Christopher Columbus,[162] the European colonization of the Americas began, with St. Augustine, Florida becoming the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States.[163] From the 16th through the 19th centuries, the population of Native Americans declined in the following ways: epidemic diseases brought from Europe;[164] genocide and warfare at the hands of European explorers and colonists,[165][166] as well as between tribes;[167][168] displacement from their lands;[169] internal warfare,[170] enslavement;[171] and intermarriage.[172][173]\\r\\nAs defined by the United States Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders are \\"persons having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands\\".[175] Previously called Asian Pacific American, along with Asian Americans beginning in 1976, this was changed in 1997.[176] As of the 2010 United States Census there are 1.2 million who reside in the United States, and make up 0.4% of the nation's total population, of whom 56% are multiracial.[f][177] 14% of the population have at least a bachelor's degree,[177] and 15.1% live in poverty, below the poverty threshold.[177] As compared to the 2000 United States Census this population grew by 40%;[175] and 71% live in the West; of those over half (52%) live in either Hawaii or California, with no other states having populations greater than 100,000.[175] The largest concentration of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, is Honolulu County in Hawaii,[177] and Los Angeles County in the continental United States.[175]\\r\\nThe United States has a growing multiracial identity movement. Multiracial Americans numbered 7.0?million in 2008, or 2.3% of the population;[112] by the 2010 census the Multiracial increased to 9,009,073, or 2.9% of the total population.[178] They can be any combination of races (White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, \\"some other race\\") and ethnicities.[179] The largest population of Multiracial Americans were those of White and African American descent, with a total of 1,834,212 self-identifying individuals.[178] Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States, is biracial with his mother being of English and Irish descent and his father being of Kenyan birth;[180][181] however, Obama only self-identifies as being African American.[182][183]\\r\\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, 6.2% or 19,107,368 Americans chose to self-identify with the \\"some other race\\" category, the third most popular option. Also, 36.7% or 18,503,103 Hispanic/Latino Americans chose to identify as some other race as these Hispanic/Latinos may feel the U.S. Census does not describe their European and American Indian ancestry as they understand it to be.[185] A significant portion of the Hispanic and Latino population self-identifies as Mestizo, particularly the Mexican and Central American community. Mestizo is not a racial category in the U.S. Census, but signifies someone who has both European and American Indian ancestry.\\r\\nA national personification is an anthropomorphism of a nation or its people; it can appear in both editorial cartoons and propaganda.\\r\\nUncle Sam is a national personification of the United States and sometimes more specifically of the American government, with the first usage of the term dating from the War of 1812. He is depicted as a stern elderly white man with white hair and a goatee beard, and dressed in clothing that recalls the design elements of the flag of the United States ÿ for example, typically a top hat with red and white stripes and white stars on a blue band, and red and white striped trousers.\\r\\nColumbia is a poetic name for the Americas and the feminine personification of the United States of America, made famous by African-American poet Phillis Wheatley during the American Revolutionary War in 1776. It has inspired the names of many persons, places, objects, institutions, and companies in the Western Hemisphere and beyond, including the District of Columbia, the seat of government of the United States.\\r\\nEnglish is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some lawssuch as U.S. naturalization requirementsstandardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language.[187][188] Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states.[189] Both English and Hawaiian are official languages in Hawaii by state law.[190]\\r\\nWhile neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.[191] Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents. The latter include court forms.[192] Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico.\\r\\nReligion in the United States has a high adherence level compared to other developed countries, as well as a diversity in beliefs. The First Amendment to the country's Constitution prevents the Federal government from making any \\"law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\\". The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this as preventing the government from having any authority in religion. A majority of Americans report that religion plays a \\"very important\\" role in their lives, a proportion unusual among developed countries, although similar to the other nations of the Americas.[194] Many faiths have flourished in the United States, including both later imports spanning the country's multicultural immigrant heritage, as well as those founded within the country; these have led the United States to become the most religiously diverse country in the world.[195]\\r\\nThe majority of Americans (76%) are Christians, mostly within Protestant and Catholic denominations; these adherents constitute 51% and 25% of the population, respectively.[196] Other religions include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, which collectively make up about 4% to 5% of the adult population.[196][197][198] Another 15% of the adult population identifies as having no religious belief or no religious affiliation.[196] According to the American Religious Identification Survey, religious belief varies considerably across the country: 59% of Americans living in Western states (the \\"Unchurched Belt\\") report a belief in God, yet in the South (the \\"Bible Belt\\") the figure is as high as 86%.[196][199]\\r\\nSeveral of the original Thirteen Colonies were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination: the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English Puritans, Pennsylvania by Irish and English Quakers, Maryland by English and Irish Catholics, and Virginia by English Anglicans. Although some individual states retained established religious confessions well into the 19th century, the United States was the first nation to have no official state-endorsed religion.[200] Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, the framers of the Constitution rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise, thus protecting any religious organization, institution, or denomination from government interference. The decision was mainly influenced by European Rationalist and Protestant ideals, but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them.[201]\\r\\nThe First Baptist Church in America in Providence, Rhode Island.\\r\\nThe Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. is the largest Catholic church in the United States.\\r\\nHoly Trinity Orthodox Cathedral in Chicago's Ukrainian Village\\r\\nUnity Temple Unitarian Universalist church in Oak Park, Illinois\\r\\nTouro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island is America's oldest surviving synagogue.\\r\\nThe Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan is the largest mosque in North America.\\r\\nHsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California is one of the largest Buddhist temples in the Western Hemisphere.\\r\\nHindu Temple in Malibu, California.\\r\\nThe Bah' House of Worship, Wilmette, Illinois.\\r\\nThe Jain Center of Greater Phoenix (JCGP)\\r\\nThe American culture is primarily a Western culture, but is influenced by Native American, West African, Asian, Polynesian, and Latino cultures.\\r\\nThe United States of America has its own unique social and cultural characteristics, such as dialect, music, arts, social habits, cuisine and folklore.[54]\\r\\nIts chief early European influences came from English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish settlers of colonial America during British rule.

Historians have learned about the eruption from the eyewitness account of Pliny the Younger, a Roman administrator and poet.[1] The event is the namesake for the Vesuvian type of volcanic eruptions.\\r\\nMount Vesuvius violently spewed forth a deadly cloud of super-heated tephra and gases to a height of 33?km (21?mi), ejecting molten rock, pulverized pumice and hot ash at a massive rate of 1.5 million tons per second, ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings.[2] Several Roman settlements were obliterated and buried underneath massive pyroclastic surges and ashfall deposits, the best known being Pompeii and Herculaneum.[1][2]\\r\\nThe total inhabitants of both cities were 16,000ÿ20,000; the remains of over 1,500 people have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, but the overall death toll is still unclear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AD 79 eruption was preceded by a powerful earthquake seventeen years before on February 5, AD 62, which caused widespread destruction around the Bay of Naples, and particularly to Pompeii.[3] Some of the damage had still not been repaired when the volcano erupted.[4] The deaths of 600 sheep from \\"tainted air\\" in the vicinity of Pompeii, reported by Seneca the Younger, leads volcanologist Haraldur Sigurdsson to compare them to similar deaths of sheep in Iceland from pools of volcanic carbon dioxide and to speculate that the earthquake of AD 62 was related to new activity by Mount Vesuvius.[5]\\r\\nAnother smaller earthquake took place in AD 64; it was recorded by Suetonius in his biography of Nero,[6] and by Tacitus in Annales because it took place while Nero was in Naples performing for the first time in a public theatre.[7] Suetonius recorded that the emperor continued singing through the earthquake until he had finished his song, while Tacitus wrote that the theatre collapsed shortly after being evacuated.\\r\\nThe Romans grew accustomed to minor earth tremors in the region; the writer Pliny the Younger wrote that they \\"were not particularly alarming because they are frequent in Campania\\". Small earthquakes started taking place on 20 August 79,[4] becoming more frequent over the next four days, but the warnings were not recognized.[8]\\r\\nReconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day, August 22, was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger, who at that point was staying at Misenum, on the other side of the Bay of Naples about 30 kilometres (19?mi) from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of the eruption. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, to talk to people who had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning. Around 1:00 P.M., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, August 23, pyroclastic flows in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\\r\\nPliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption:\\r\\nBroad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of Vesuvius; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night.[9]\\r\\nAccording to a stratigraphic study (a study of the layers of ash) by Sigurdsson, Cashdollar, and Sparks, published in 1982, and now a standard reference, the eruption of Vesuvius of AD 79 unfolded in two phases:[10] a Vesuvian eruption that lasted eighteen to twenty hours and produced a fall of pumice and ashes southward of the volcano that accumulated up to depths of 2.8?m (9.2?ft) at Pompeii, followed by pyroclastic surges or nues ardentes in the second Pelan phase that reached as far as Misenum but was concentrated to the west and northwest. Two pyroclastic surges engulfed Pompeii, burning and asphyxiating any living beings who had remained behind. Herculaneum and Oplontis received the brunt of the surges and were buried in fine pyroclastic deposits, pulverized pumice and lava fragments.\\r\\nIn an article published in 2002, Sigurdsson and Casey elaborate on the stratigraphic evidence based on excavations and surveys up until then. In this interpretation, the quasi-initial explosion (not quite initial) produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between 15?km (9.3?mi) and 30?km (19?mi) high, which, due to northwest winds, rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The eruption is viewed as primarily phreatomagmatic; that is, the chief energy supporting the blast column came from the escape of steam generated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep-seated faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.\\r\\nSubsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases densified and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum, not Pompeii. Additional explosions reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Vesuvian and Pelan six times. Surges 4 and 5 are believed by the authors to have destroyed and buried Pompeii.[11] Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\\r\\nThe authors suggest that the first ash falls are to be interpreted as early-morning, low-volume explosions not seen from Misenum, causing Rectina to send her messenger on a ride of several hours around the Bay of Naples, then passable, providing an answer to the paradox of how the messenger might miraculously appear at Pliny's villa so shortly after a distant eruption that would have prevented him.\\r\\nA 2006 study by Zanella, Gurioli, Pareschi, and Lanza used the magnetic characteristics of over 200?samples of lithic, roof-tile, and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits in and around Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the deposits.[12] The deposits were placed by pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column. The authors argue that fragments over 2ÿ5?cm (0.8ÿ2?in) were not in the current long enough to acquire its temperature, which would have been much higher, and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures, which they estimated, and the emplacement temperatures, which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate. Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition.[13]\\r\\nAll crustal rock contains some iron or iron compounds, rendering it ferromagnetic, as do Roman roof tiles and plaster. These materials may acquire a residual field from a number of sources. When individual molecules, which are magnetic dipoles, are held in alignment by being bound in a crystalline structure, the small fields reinforce each other to form the rock's residual field.[14] Heating the material adds internal energy to it. At the Curie temperature, the vibration of the molecules is sufficient to disrupt the alignment; the material loses its residual magnetism and assumes whatever magnetic field might be applied to it only for the duration of the application. The authors term this phenomenon unblocking. Residual magnetism is considered to \\"block out\\" non-residual fields.\\r\\nA rock is a mixture of minerals, each with its own Curie temperature; the authors therefore looked for a spectrum of temperatures rather than a single temperature. In the ideal sample, the PDC did not raise the temperature of the fragment beyond the highest blocking temperature. Some constituent material retained the magnetism imposed by the Earth's field when the item was formed. The temperature was raised above the lowest blocking temperature and therefore some minerals on recooling acquired the magnetism of the Earth as it was in AD 79. The overall field of the sample was the vector sum of the fields of the high-blocking material and the low-blocking material.\\r\\nThis type of sample made possible estimation of the low unblocking temperature. Using special equipment that measured field direction and strength at various temperatures, the experimenters raised the temperature of the sample in increments of 40?C (70?F) from 100?C (210?F) until it reached the low unblocking temperature.[15] Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction. A plot of direction at each increment identified the increment at which the sample's resultant magnetism had formed.[16] That was considered to be the equilibrium temperature of the deposit. Considering the data for all the deposits of the surge arrived at a surge deposit estimate. The authors discovered that the city, Pompeii, was a relatively cool spot within a much hotter field, which they attributed to interaction of the surge with the \\"fabric\\" of the city.[17]\\r\\nThe investigators reconstruct the sequence of volcanic events as follows. On the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to 3 centimetres (1?in) fell for several hours.[18] It heated the roof tiles to 120ÿ140?C (250ÿ280?F).[19] This period would have been the last opportunity to escape. Subsequently, a second column deposited a grey pumice with clastics up to 10?cm (4?in), temperature unsampled, but presumed to be higher, for 18 hours. These two falls were the Plinian phase. The collapse of the edges of these clouds generated the first dilute PDCs, which must have been devastating to Herculaneum, but did not enter Pompeii.\\r\\nEarly in the morning of the second day the grey cloud began to collapse to a greater degree. Two major surges struck and destroyed Pompeii. Herculaneum and all its population no longer existed. The emplacement temperature range of the first surge was 180ÿ220?C (360ÿ430?F), minimum temperatures; of the second, 220ÿ260?C (430ÿ500?F). The depositional temperature of the first was 140ÿ300?C (280ÿ570?F). Upstream and downstream of the flow it was 300ÿ360?C (570ÿ680?F).[20]\\r\\nThe variable temperature of the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as 100?C (210?F), the boiling point of water.[21] The authors suggest that elements of the bottom of the flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.\\r\\nDuring the last surge, which was very dilute, one meter more of deposits fell over the region.[22]\\r\\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger, who was 17 at the time of the eruption,[23] to the historian, Tacitus.[24] Observing the first volcanic activity from Misenum across the Bay of Naples from the volcano, approximately 35 kilometres (22?mi) away, the elder Pliny launched a rescue fleet and went himself to the rescue of a personal friend. His nephew declined to join the party. One of the nephew's letters relates what he could discover from witnesses of his uncle's experiences.[25] In a second letter the younger Pliny details his own observations after the departure of his uncle.[26]\\r\\nThe two men saw an extraordinarily dense cloud rising rapidly above the mountain:[25]\\r\\nI cannot give you a more exact description of its appearance than by comparing to a pine tree; for it shot up to a great height in the form of a tall trunk, which spread out at the top as though into branches. [...] Occasionally it was brighter, occasionally darker and spotted, as it was either more or less filled with earth and cinders.\\r\\nThese events and a request by messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, continuing to study, and bathing, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. At another tremor near dawn the population abandoned the village. After still a third \\"the sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks\\", which is evidence for a tsunami. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage from wave action.\\r\\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.\\r\\nPliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano, explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue.[27] Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.[27]\\r\\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice, and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back he stated \\"Fortune favors the brave\\" and ordered him to continue on to Stabiae (about 4.5?km or 2.8?mi from Pompeii), where Pomponianus was.[27] Pomponianus had already loaded a ship with possessions and was preparing to leave, but the same onshore wind that brought Pliny's ship to the location had prevented anyone from leaving.[27]\\r\\nPliny and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends attributed to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress.[27] They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again but the wind had not changed. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed, escaping ultimately by land.[28] Very likely, he had collapsed and died, which is the most popular explanation of why his friends abandoned him, although Suetonius offers an alternative story of his ordering a slave to kill him to avoid the pain of incineration. How the slave would have escaped to tell the tale remains a mystery. There is no mention of such an event in his nephew's letters.\\r\\nIn the first letter to Tacitus his nephew suggested that his death was due to the reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group.[27] However, Stabiae was 16?km (9.9?mi) from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the fumes, and so it is more likely that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack.[29] An asthmatic attack is also not out of the question. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.\\r\\nAlong with Pliny the Elder, the only other notable casualties of the eruption to be known by name were Agrippa (a son of the Jewish princess Drusilla and the procurator Antonius Felix) and his wife.[30]\\r\\nBy 2003 around 1,044?casts made from impressions of bodies in the ash deposits had been recovered in and around Pompeii, with the scattered bones of another 100.[31] The remains of about 332 bodies have been found at Herculaneum (300 in arched vaults discovered in 1980).[32] What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or the percentage of the dead to the total number at risk remain completely unknown.\\r\\nIn May 2018 a cast made from an impression of a horse, found in a villa on the northern outskirts of Pompei was displayed by Pompei officials.[33]\\r\\nThirty-eight percent of the 1044 were found in the ash fall deposits, the majority inside buildings. These are thought to have been killed mainly by roof collapses, with the smaller number of victims found outside buildings probably killed by falling roof slates or by larger rocks thrown out by the volcano. This differs from modern experience, since over the last four hundred years only around 4% of victims have been killed by ash falls during explosive eruptions. The remaining 62% of remains found at Pompeii were in the pyroclastic surge deposits,[31] and thus were probably killed by them. It was initially believed that due to the state of the bodies found at Pompeii and the outline of clothes on the bodies it was unlikely that high temperatures were a significant cause. But in 2010, studies indicated that during the fourth pyroclastic surge ÿ the first surge to reach Pompeii ÿ temperatures reached 300?C (572?F). Volcanologist Giuseppe Mastrolorenzo, who led the study, noted that \\"(It was) enough to kill hundreds of people in a fraction of a second\\". In reference as to why the bodies were frozen in suspended action, \\"The contorted postures are not the effects of a long agony, but of the cadaveric spasm, a consequence of heat shock on corpses.\\"[34]\\r\\nHerculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under 23 metres (75?ft) of material deposited by pyroclastic surges. It is likely that most, or all, of the known victims in this town were killed by the surges, particularly given evidence of high temperatures found on the skeletons of the victims found in the arched vaults, and the existence of carbonised wood in many of the buildings.\\r\\nThese people were all caught on the former seashore by the first surge and died of thermal shock but not of carbonization, although some were partly carbonized by later and hotter surges. The arched vaults were most likely boathouses, as the crossbeams in the overhead were probably for the suspension of boats. No boats have been found, indicating they may have been used for the earlier escape of some of the population. The rest were concentrated in the chambers at a density of as high as 3 persons per square meter. As only 85 metres (279?ft) of the coast have been excavated, the casualties waiting to be excavated may well be as high as the thousands.[35]\\r\\nThe year of the eruption is pinned to AD 79 by references in contemporary Roman writers, a number of them apart from Pliny the Younger, and has never been seriously questioned. It is determined by the well-known events of the reign of Titus. Vespasian died that year. When Titus visited Pompeii to give orders for the relief of the displaced population, he was the sole ruler. In the year after the eruption, AD 80, he faced another disaster, a great fire at Rome.\\r\\nThe time of year is stated once in one historical document, the first letter of Pliny the Younger to Tacitus,[25] where it appears as \\"nonum kal. Septembres\\". This seems to be an abbreviation of a standard date, to be interpreted as \\"the ninth day before the Kalends of September\\", which in the Julian calendar, in general use by then, would have been eight days before September 1, that is August 24 (the Romans counted September 1 as one of the nine).\\r\\nAugust 24 is not necessarily the date given by Pliny. It represents an editorial collusion to use the manuscript text of Pliny's letters in the Medicean Laurentian Library, which also appears in the edition printed by Aldus Manutius (1508) and in all recensions since then, even though the numerous other Pliny manuscripts, as well as the works of other authors, offer many alternative dates.[36]","input":"When did mt vesuvius erupt and cover pompeii?"},{"output":"Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru","context":"The Sardar Sarovar Dam is a gravity dam on the Narmada river near Navagam, Gujarat in India. Four Indian states, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharastra and Rajasthan, receive water and electricity supplied from the dam. The foundation stone of the project was laid out by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on April 5, 1961. The project took form in 1979 as part of a development scheme to increase irrigation and produce hydroelectricity. The dam was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 17, 2017.[3]\\r\\nOne of the 30 dams planned on river Narmada, Sardar Sarovar Dam (SSD) is the largest structure to be built. It is one of the largest dams in the world.[4][5] It is a part of the Narmada Valley Project, a large hydraulic engineering project involving the construction of a series of large irrigation and hydroelectric multi-purpose dams on the Narmada river. Following a number of controversial cases before the Supreme Court of India (1999, 2000, 2003), by 2014 the Narmada Control Authority had approved a series of changes in the final height?ÿ and the associated displacement caused by the increased reservoir, from the original 80?m (260?ft) to a final 163?m (535?ft) from foundation.[6][7] The project will irrigate more than 18,000?km2 (6,900?sq?mi), most of it in drought prone areas of Kutch and Saurashtra.\\r\\nThe dam's main power plant houses six 200?MW Francis pump-turbines to generate electricity and include a pumped-storage capability. Additionally, a power plant on the intake for the main canal contains five 50?MW Kaplan turbine-generators. The total installed capacity of the power facilities is 1,450?MW.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the south west Malwa plateau, the dissected hill tracts culminate in the Mathwar hills, located in Alirajpur district of Madhya Pradesh. Below these hills Narmada river flows through a long, terrific gorge. This gorge extends into Gujarat where the river is tapped by the Sardar Sarovar dam.\\r\\nThe dam will irrigate 17,920?km2 (6,920?sq?mi) of land spread over 12?districts, 62?talukas, and 3,393 villages (75% of which is drought-prone areas) in Gujarat and 730?km2 (280?sq?mi) in the arid areas of Barmer and Jalore districts of Rajasthan. The dam will also provide flood protection to riverine reaches measuring 30,000?ha (74,000 acres) covering 210 villages and Bharuch city and a population of 400,000 in Gujarat.[8] Saurastra Narmada Avataran Irrigation is a major program to help irrigate a lot of regions using the canal's water.\\r\\nIn 2011, the government of Gujarat announced plans to generate solar power by placing solar panels over the canal, making it beneficial for the surrounding villages to get power and also help to reduce the evaporation of water. The first phase consists of placing panels along a 25?km length of canal, with capacity for up to 25?MW of power.[9]\\r\\nThe dam is one of India's most controversial, and its environmental impact and net costs and benefits are widely debated.[citation needed] The World Bank was initially funding SSD, but withdrew in 1994. The Narmada Dam has been the centre of controversy and protest since the late 1980s.[10]\\r\\nOne such protest takes centre stage in the Spanner Films documentary Drowned Out (2002), which follows one tribal family who decide to stay at home and drown rather than make way for the Narmada Dam.[11] An earlier documentary film is called A Narmada Diary (1995) by Anand Patwardhan and Simantini Dhuru. The efforts of NBA to seek \\"social and environmental justice\\" for those most directly affected by the Sardar Sarover Dam construction feature prominently in this film. It received the (Filmfare Award for Best Documentary-1996).[12]\\r\\nThe figurehead of much of the protest is Medha Patkar, the leader of the Narmada Bachao Andolan (\\"Save Narmada Movement\\").[13] The movement was cemented in 1989, and received the Right Livelihood Award in 1991.[14]\\r\\nSupport for the protests also came from Indian author Arundhati Roy, who wrote \\"The Greater Common Good\\", an essay reprinted in her book The Cost of Living, in protest of the Narmada Dam Project.[15] In the essay, Roy states:\\r\\nBig Dams are to a Nation's \\"Development\\" what Nuclear Bombs are to its Military Arsenal. They are both weapons of mass destruction. They're both weapons Governments use to control their own people. Both Twentieth Century emblems that mark a point in time when human intelligence has outstripped its own instinct for survival. They're both malignant indications of civilisation turning upon itself. They represent the severing of the link, not just the linkthe understandingbetween human beings and the planet they live on. They scramble the intelligence that connects eggs to hens, milk to cows, food to forests, water to rivers, air to life and the earth to human existence.\\r\\nThe Second Interim Report of the Experts' Committee set up by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) of the Government of India to assess the planning and implementation of environmental safeguards with respect to the Sardar Sarovar (SSP) and Indira Sagar projects (ISP) on the Narmada River. The report covers the status of compliances on catchment area treatment (CAT), flora and fauna and carrying capacity upstream, command area development (CAD), compensatory afforestation and human health aspects in project impact areas. Construction, on the other hand, has been proceeding apace: the ISP is complete and the SSP nearing completion. The report recommends that no further reservoir-filling be done at either SSP or ISP; that no further work be done on canal construction; and that even irrigation from the existing network be stopped forthwith until failures of compliance on the various environmental parameters have been fully remedied.[18]\\r\\nDespite popular protest, the Supreme Court gave clearance for the height to be increased to 121.92?m (400?ft), but in the same judgment Justice Mr. Bharucha gave directions to Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra (the Grievance Redressal Authorities of Gujarat) that before further construction begins, they should certify (after inspection) that all those displaced by the raise in height of 5 metres have already been satisfactorily rehabilitated, and also that suitable vacant land for rehabilitating them is already in the possession of the respective States. This process shall be repeated for every successive five metre increase in height.\\r\\nAssociation for India's Development website","input":"Who laid the foundation of sardar sarovar dam?"},{"output":"The Vegas Golden Knights","context":"Since being founded in 1917, the National Hockey League (NHL), which in its first two seasons started out as a three-team league and eventually grew to thirty-one in its current state, has expanded and contracted numerous times throughout its history. The following is a complete history of organizational changes in the NHL.\\r\\nThe four teams that began the inaugural NHL season were the Montreal Canadiens, the Montreal Wanderers, the original Ottawa Senators, and the Toronto Arenas. However, after completing four games out of the scheduled 22, the Wanderers withdrew from the league due to their arena burning down, and the NHL continued this season and the next with only three teams.\\r\\nIn its third season, 1919ÿ20, the NHL underwent its first expansion, adding the Quebec Bulldogs. Toronto changed its name to Toronto St. Patricks. The next season, however, Quebec relocated to Hamilton, becoming the Hamilton Tigers. These same four teams continued playing for four seasons, up to 1923ÿ24.\\r\\nTwo new teams joined the NHL in its eighth season, the Boston Bruins, and the Montreal Maroons.\\r\\nThe next season, the NHL added two new teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the New York Americans. The Americans were stocked by purchasing the contracts of the Hamilton Tigers players, and the Tigers franchise was subsequently revoked by the league.\\r\\nThe NHL continued to expand the following season, adding the Chicago Black Hawks, the Detroit Cougars, and the New York Rangers, growing to ten teams, thus more than doubling its size in its first decade of existence. During the 1926ÿ27 season, Toronto was renamed the Toronto Maple Leafs, taking effect next season. For the 1930ÿ31 season, the Pirates moved from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, becoming the Philadelphia Quakers, and Detroit was renamed the Detroit Falcons.\\r\\nAfter fourteen seasons of steady expansion, the NHL contracted to eight teams, dropping the Philadelphia Quakers and the original Ottawa Senators for the 1931ÿ32 season.\\r\\nFor the 1932ÿ33 season, after missing one season, the original Ottawa Senators rejoined the NHL, and the Detroit Falcons were renamed the Detroit Red Wings. Two seasons later, for the 1934ÿ35 season, the Ottawa Senators relocated, becoming the St. Louis Eagles.\\r\\nThe Eagles folded after one season, and the NHL was once again an eight-team league for three seasons.\\r\\nThe Montreal Maroons withdrew from the league for the 1938ÿ39 season, further reducing the number of teams in the NHL to seven, shrinking to the size the league was in 1925ÿ26. Play continued for four seasons with seven teams, with the New York Americans changing their name to the Brooklyn Americans for the 1941ÿ42 season, their last.\\r\\nThe 1942ÿ43 season saw the folding of the Brooklyn Americans, thus ushering in the Original Six era of the NHL, which lasted without any organizational changes for twenty-five seasons.\\r\\nThe 1967 expansion doubled the number of teams in the league, with an upfront expansion fee of $2 million each ($14.7 million today).[1] For the 1967ÿ68 season, six new teams were added to the NHL: the California Seals, the Los Angeles Kings, the Minnesota North Stars, the Philadelphia Flyers, the Pittsburgh Penguins, and the St. Louis Blues. During their first season, the California Seals were renamed the Oakland Seals.\\r\\nThe Oakland Seals were renamed the California Golden Seals for their fourth season in 1970ÿ71. The same season the NHL added two new teams, the Buffalo Sabres and the Vancouver Canucks, paying an expansion fee of $6 million each ($37.8 million today).[1]\\r\\nTwo more teams joined for the 1972ÿ73 NHL season, the New York Islanders and the Atlanta Flames. With the competing World Hockey Association (WHA) starting that same season, the NHL was not able to raise its expansion fee from the price of two years earlier, $6 million ($35.1 million today), with the Islanders paying an additional $5 million ($29.3 million today) to the New York Rangers for infringing on their territory.[2]\\r\\nTwo more teams joined for the 1974ÿ75 NHL season, the Washington Capitals and the Kansas City Scouts, but the ongoing competition from the WHA meant that the overall revenue stream of the NHL had not improved, so the league kept the expansion fee for new owners at the $6 million ($29.8 million today) of two years and four years earlier.[2] The earnings situation for the new franchises was so poor that (at least) the Capitals were able to negotiate a reduction to a total fee of $2.85 million ($14.1 million today).[2]\\r\\nGoing into the 1977ÿ78 NHL season, the California Golden Seals relocated and became the Cleveland Barons, and the Kansas City Scouts moved as well, becoming the Colorado Rockies.\\r\\nFor the first time since the 1942ÿ43 season the NHL contracted, merging the Cleveland Barons into the Minnesota North Stars.\\r\\nFollowing seven seasons of revenue draining competition, the NHLÿWHA merger was completed for the start of the 1979ÿ80 NHL season. Four teams came over from the WHA, paying an expansion fee of $7.5 million each ($25.3 million today).[1] These new NHL teams were the Edmonton Oilers, the Hartford Whalers, the Quebec Nordiques, and the (original) Winnipeg Jets. This also doubled the number of Canadian teams in the league. The following season, Atlanta relocated and became the Calgary Flames. In turn, for the 1982ÿ83 season, the Colorado Rockies moved, becoming the New Jersey Devils. Chicago changed the spelling of their name from the Black Hawks to the Blackhawks for the 1986ÿ87 season, based on its original franchise documents. Standing at 21 teams for twelve seasons, this was one of the longer stable periods of NHL history, though surpassed by the twenty-five seasons of the Original Six period, when no additions, moves nor name changes occurred.\\r\\nThe 1991ÿ92 season saw the dawn of rapid expansion and relocation in the NHL, which lasted for the next ten years, starting with the addition of the San Jose Sharks, paying an expansion fee of $45 million ($80.9 million today).[1]\\r\\nTwo new teams joined the league the following season, the Ottawa Senators and the Tampa Bay Lightning, paying an expansion fee of $45 million each ($78.5 million today).[1]\\r\\nThe next season, another two teams were added, the Florida Panthers and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, paying an expansion fee of $50 million each ($84.7 million today), with Anaheim paying an additional $25 million ($42.4 million today) to the Los Angeles Kings for infringing on their region.[1] The Minnesota North Stars relocated, becoming the Dallas Stars. Two seasons later, for the 1995ÿ96 season, the Quebec Nordiques relocated and became the Colorado Avalanche. The following season, the Winnipeg Jets also moved, becoming the Phoenix Coyotes. The season after that, the Hartford Whalers relocated, becoming the Carolina Hurricanes.\\r\\nThe Nashville Predators joined the league for the 1998ÿ99 season, paying an expansion fee of $80 million ($120.1 million today).[1]\\r\\nThe following season, another team started play, the Atlanta Thrashers, paying the same expansion fee of $80 million ($117.5 million today) as the Predators paid a year earlier.[1]\\r\\nFor its 2000ÿ01 season, the NHL added the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild, each paying the same expansion fee of $80 million ($113.7 million today) as Nashville and Atlanta paid in the previous two years.[1] The NHL had reached a slate of 30 teams, entering the second longest period (after the Original Six period) of membership stability in its history. While it stayed at 30 teams for eighteen seasons, there were some moves and name changes. The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim changed their name to the Anaheim Ducks in the 2006ÿ07 season. The Atlanta Thrashers moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, becoming the second version of the Winnipeg Jets in the 2011ÿ12 NHL season. The Phoenix Coyotes changed their name to Arizona Coyotes for the 2014ÿ15 NHL season.\\r\\nOn June 22, 2016, the Board of Governors voted 30-0 to add an expansion franchise in Las Vegas for the 2017ÿ18 season, charging an expansion fee of $500 million ($509.8 million today).[1] An announcement was made the same day by Gary Bettman in Las Vegas. The Vegas Golden Knights play at T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip.\\r\\nDespite statements from the NHL in recent years that no further expansion or even relocation was planned for the foreseeable future (a statement partially contradicted by the relocation of the Thrashers to Winnipeg), there have been rumors and talks of potential new sites for existing or new teams in various locations in the United States and Canada. Since Winnipeg (the previous frontrunner) received the Jets in 2011, Quebec City and Seattle have been the most-discussed potential relocation sites; other potential markets for relocation that have seen action in recent years include Houston, Saskatoon, Kansas City, and Southern Ontario (which would be Hamilton, Toronto or Markham, although the league has actively blocked all of the Southern Ontario efforts to date, citing territorial concerns with the Buffalo Sabres and Toronto Maple Leafs). On February 13, 2018, a Seattle group placed a bid to start play in the 2020 season.","input":"What's the newest team in the nhl?"},{"output":"Guatemala","context":"The history of Central America is the study of the region known as Central America.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of the relaxing Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Mayans, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some[1] culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.\\r\\nCentral America is composed of seven independent nations: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. After the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, most of the inhabitants of Central America shared a similar history. The exception was the Western Caribbean Zone, which included the Caribbean coast and encompassed both semi-independent indigenous polities, runaway slave communities, and settlers, especially British settlers who would eventually form British Honduras (the modern-day nation of Belize), a sparsely populated area that was inhabited by the British through the Treaty of Madrid from Spain. When Spain failed to regain control over British Honduras, the British continued to inhabit the country, and eventually colonized it. When Guatemala gained its independence, they assumed inheritance of British Honduras from Spain. British Honduras had been a British settlement, not a Colony (the treaty between Spain and The United Kingdom prohibited British Colonies in the territory)for several years. After many years of controversy, a treaty was signed between Guatemala and the United Kingdom in which the Guatemalan President of the time recognized the original territory (granted by the kingdom of Spain to the British Crown) of Belize. Within this treaty, was also an agreement that a cart road be built from Guatemala City through British Honduras to the Caribbean Sea. Since the cart road was never built, Guatemala declared the treaty null and void. British Honduras for the British and Belize for the Spaniards and Guatemalans gained its independence from Great Britain in 1981 and adopted the name \\"Belize\\". Guatemala still disputes the Belizean Territory.\\r\\nFrom the 16th century through 1821, Central America formed the Captaincy General of Guatemala, sometimes known also as the Kingdom of Guatemala, composed by a part of the state of Chiapas (nowadays Mexico), Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Officially, the Captaincy was part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain and therefore under the supervision of the Spanish viceroy in Mexico City. It was, however, administered not by the viceroy or his deputies, but by an independently appointed Captain General headquartered first in Antigua Guatemala and later in Guatemala City.\\r\\nIn 1811, independence movements broke out in El Salvador in reaction to events in the Peninsular War, and again in 1814 after the restoration of Ferdinand VII. Both revolts were easily suppressed and the political unrest was subsumed into the general political process in the Spanish world that led to the Spanish Constitution of 1812. Between 1810 and 1814, the Captaincy General elected seven representatives to the Cdiz Cortes, in addition to forming a locally-elected Provincial Deputation.[2] In 1821 a congress of Central American Criollos in Guatemala City composed the Act of Independence of Central America to declare the region's independence from Spain, effective on 15 September of that year.[3] That date is still marked as independence day by most Central American nations. The Spanish Captain General, Gabino Ganza, sympathized with the rebels and it was decided that he should stay on as interim leader until a new government could be formed. Independence was short-lived, for the conservative leaders in Guatemala welcomed annexation by the First Mexican Empire of Agustn de Iturbide on 5 January 1822. Central American liberals objected to this, but an army from Mexico under General Vicente Filisola occupied Guatemala City and quelled dissent.\\r\\nWhen Mexico became a republic the following year, it acknowledged Central America's right to determine its own destiny. On 1 July 1823, the congress of Central America declared absolute independence from Spain, Mexico, and any other foreign nation, including North America and a Republica system of government, was established.\\r\\nIn 1823, the nation of Central America was formed. It was intended to be a federal republic modeled after the United States of America. It was provisionally known as \\"The United Provinces of Central America,\\" while the final name according to the Constitution of 1824 was \\"The Federal Republic of Central America.\\" It is sometimes incorrectly referred in English as \\"The United States of Central America.\\" The Central American nation consisted of the states of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. In the 1830s, an additional state was added, Los Altos, with its capital in Quetzaltenango, occupying parts of what is now the western highlands of Guatemala and part of Chiapas (now part of Mexico), but this state was reincorporated into Guatemala and Mexico respectively in 1840.\\r\\nCentral American liberals had high hopes for the federal republic, which they believed would evolve into a modern, democratic nation, enriched by trade crossing through it between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. These aspirations are reflected in the emblems of the federal republic: The flag shows a white band between two blue stripes, representing the land between two oceans. The coat of arms shows five mountains (one for each state) between two oceans, surmounted by a Phrygian cap, the emblem of the French Revolution.\\r\\nThe Union dissolved in civil war between 1838 and 1840. Its disintegration began when Nicaragua separated from the federation on November 5, 1838.\\r\\nUPCA\\r\\nThe United Provinces of Central America (or PUCA- Provincias Unidas De Centro-America in Spanish) is the name given to the different states of Central America in the time after Central Americas independence and before becoming their own distinct nations (between 1823-1840[4]). It was a political movement that strived to unify the regions of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (Panama and Belize at the time were under separate ownership) under a liberal federal government that believed that united they would be a stronger political unit. Unfortunately, due to many strong political disagreements within the different states, the UPCA eventually disbanded and the regions became separate nations with devastating political and economic civil wars that are still felt today.\\r\\nThe kingdom of Guatemala (what Central America was more commonly known as during Spanish and Mexican rule) was annexed into Mexico in 1822 under the rule of emperor Agustn de Iturbide. Shortly after, opposition from Central Americans began against the monarch and they pushed for independence from Mexico. Iturbides unsuccessful leadership of Central America caused his party to fail against the uprising rebels and on July 1, 1823, Central America gained its independence.\\r\\nAfter receiving independence, officials from the different regions gathered in a junta to decide the future of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala. They decided on uniting themselves into a federation of 5 autonomous states, thus creating the UPCA, a term coined by Brigadier General Filisola who was stationed in Guatemala City.\\r\\nThe UPCAs aims were to be a liberal government with political principles modeled after the United States,[5] and also to remain united. They felt that the provinces alone were too small and weak economically to survive as sovereign states so they avert[ed] fragmentation of the isthmus[6] and pushed for union. However, the UPCA soon noticed that there were many political ideals between the regions and conservative parties on the other end of the political spectrum actively showed their discontent under the new liberal regime. Despite this, the beginning of the federation went relatively smooth and negotiations helped them reform borders, capital cities were moved to accommodate the citizens, and economies of coffee grew high. All the while, tensions between the liberals and conservatives and power struggles within the different economies increasingly grew.\\r\\nOne the most notable key figures of UPCA was Francisco Morazan, a liberal advocate who was chosen as president of the UPCA. Between the 1820s through the 1830s Morazan took an active role in liberal movements throughout Central America, especially in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras against conservative parties. These battles between parties increasingly divided the nation causing sour relationships and distance between them. Differences between liberals who wanted free trade favored a republic and had anti-clerical views contested those of the conservatives who wanted a monarchy, trade under close control and power to the church. These conflicts, along with cholera outbreaks, foreign intervention and distress among those in poverty caused many insurgencies those rose up against liberal movements and vice versa resulted in various civil wars throughout Central America.\\r\\nMorazan was captured in Costa Rica by the conservative party and they assassinated him on September 15, 1842),[7] which marked the official end of the UPCA. Upon notification of his death, greater turmoil and fights among the opposing liberal and conservative parties increased. It is said that the conservative-liberal struggles that Morazan campaigned for are still in effect today.[8] In addition, lacking a central authority proved to be unproductive and created more disputes and distrust within the different nations. In fact, foreigners who were looking to make economic and/or political negations were told that they had to go to each individual region for consultations and found it inconvenient.[6] The desire for power and their inability to overcome bad relations among each other led to the fall of the UPCA. Nicaragua, Honduras, and Costa Rica seceded from the union in 1838. In 1839 Guatemala seceded, and in 1840 El Salvador did the same.\\r\\nThe provinces shortly after became their own separate republican nations, of which we are more familiar with today and eventually Panama and Belize joined what we know today as Central America. Tensions among the different nations, however, continued to grow more aggressive throughout the rest of the 19th century. Despite knowing that being unified would overall work better for Central America, they remained separate. Though many attempts to reunite the nations have been attempted throughout the years it always resulted with unsuccessful results. Civil wars continued to be part of Central America through the 20th and parts of the 21st century as well.\\r\\nVarious attempts were made to reunite Central America in the 19th century, but none succeeded for any length of time:\\r\\nDespite the failure of a lasting political union, the concept of Central American reunification, though lacking enthusiasm from the leaders of the individual countries, rises from time to time. In 1856-1857, the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by U.S. adventurer William Walker. Today, all five nations fly flags that retain the old federal motif of two outer blue bands bounding an inner white stripe. (Costa Rica, traditionally the least committed of the five to regional integration, modified its flag significantly in 1848 by darkening the blue and adding a double-wide inner red band, in honor of the French tricolor).\\r\\nEven though the dates for this period change from country to country, they approximately correspond to the years between 1870 and 1930. During this time, political elites in the five Central American countries advanced reforms on agriculture, commerce, and redefined the relationship between the state, society and the economy. The most relevant political figures during this period were the presidents Justo Rufino Barrios in Guatemala, Rafael Zaldivar in El Salvador, Braulio Carrillo and Tomas Guardia in Costa Rica, Macro Aurelio Soto in Honduras, and Jose Santos Zelaya in Nicaragua. The key result of this period in all the Central American countries was a transition from communal to private property of land. The extent to which liberals targeted common lands for privatization varied from country to country. Likewise, there were important differences in the size of the commercial landholding estate. Another source of variance among the policies promoted by the liberal governments was the use of coercion and security organizations in the implementation of the different reforms to the landholding policies.[9]\\r\\nIn 1907, a Central American Court of Justice was created. On December 13, 1960, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua established the Central American Common Market (\\"CACM\\"). Costa Rica chose not to participate in the CACM. The goals for the CACM were to create greater political unification and success of import substitution industrialization policies. The project was an immediate economic success but was abandoned after the 1969 \\"Football War\\" between El Salvador and Honduras.\\r\\nBy the 1930s the United Fruit Company owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase Banana Republic. [10]\\r\\nA Central American Parliament has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. The regional parliament seat deputies from the four former members of the Union (Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras), as well as from Panama and the Dominican Republic.\\r\\nAnother initiative is known as Free Movement of Persons in the CA-4, which has opened the borders between Nicaragua and Guatemala removing the need to carry a passport to cross borders, just a national ID (cdula de identidad) is enough to cross borders. This initiative is the result of negotiations of the Central American Commission of Directors of Migration (OCAM) with the support of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). This initiative has been in effect since 2007.[citation needed]","input":"What central american country was a british colony until 1981?"},{"output":"31 May 2009","context":"Eliza Gladys \\"Millvina\\" Dean (2 February 1912 ÿ 31 May 2009) was a British civil servant and cartographer.

An article in the Daily Mirror dated 12 May 1912 described the ordeal:\\r\\nMillvina and Bertram were raised mostly on pension funds and educated in Southampton schools, including The Gregg School. It was not until she was eight years old, and her mother was planning to remarry, that Dean was told she had been a passenger on the Titanic.\\r\\nDean worked for the British government during the Second World War and later as a purchaser for a local engineering firm. Other careers she held were as a cartographer, a secretary, and an assistant to a tobacconist.\\r\\nIt was not until Dean was in her seventies that she became involved in Titanic-related events. Over the years, she participated in numerous conventions, exhibitions, documentaries, radio and television interviews, and personal correspondence. In 1998, she travelled to the United States to participate in a Titanic convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, and another in 1999 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She had also been scheduled to appear at a commemoration of the 94th anniversary of the sinking in 2006, but a broken hip prevented her appearance.[6] She also appeared in the History special Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn October 2007, Dean became the last Titanic survivor following the death of Barbara West Dainton, who died at age 96 in England.[7]\\r\\nIn December 2007, Dean criticised the BBC and its television programme Doctor Who for including an episode with a starship \\"cruise liner\\" called the Titanic, that was similar in appearance to the historical liner. Speaking from her nursing home, she said: \\"The Titanic was a tragedy which tore so many families apart. I lost my father and he lies on that wreck. I think it is disrespectful to make entertainment of such a tragedy.\\"[8] A spokeswoman for the show said: \\"No offence was intended. 'Voyage of the Damned' is set on a spaceship called The Titanic and not a boat.\\"[8]\\r\\nIn April 2008, Dean had accepted an invitation to speak in Southampton at an event commemorating the 96th anniversary of the sinking, but ill health resulting from a respiratory infection forced her to cancel.[9]\\r\\nIn December 2008, at age 96, Dean was forced to sell several of her family's possessions to pay for her private medical care following a broken hip. These included a letter sent to her mother from the Titanic Relief Fund, and a suitcase given to her and her mother in New York following the sinking. Their sale raised approximately S32,000. In February 2009, she announced that she would be selling several more items to pay for her increasing medical costs which she said exceeded S3,000 a month.[10]\\r\\nDean died of pneumonia on the morning of 31 May 2009, 97 years and seven weeks after the Titanic sailed, at a care home in Ashurst, Hampshire.[2][11] She was cremated, and on 24 October 2009, her ashes were scattered from a launch at the docks in Southampton where the Titanic set sail.[12]\\r\\nIn response to the escalating cost of Dean's healthcare, The Millvina Fund was set up in April 2009 by the Belfast, British, and International Titanic Societies with the exclusive aim of taking care of her nursing home bills. It was given a boost by the Irish author and campaigning journalist, Don Mullan, at the opening of his worldwide Nokia photographic exhibition, A Thousand Reasons for Living, (featuring a portrait of Dean) in Dublin on 22 April 2009.[13] Mullan introduced an additional portrait of Dean's hands, as she signed a card for a Titanic autograph collector, which he produced as a limited edition of 100 copies. He made the edition available at ?500 each and then challenged the director and stars of the film Titanic (1997) - James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet - singer Celine Dion, and the corporations Sony Music, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount Pictures to match him euro-for-euro to support her with her bills.[14][15] DiCaprio and Winslet led the way with a joint contribution of US$20,000. Cameron and Dion donated US$10,000 each.","input":"When did the last survivor of titanic die?"},{"output":"In the 1980s","context":"","input":"When was the big 5 personality test created?"},{"output":"The International Financial Reporting Standards, usually called the IFRS Standards","context":"The International Financial Reporting Standards, usually called the IFRS Standards,[1] are standards issued by the IFRS Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to provide a common global language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. They are a consequence of growing international shareholding and trade and are particularly important for companies that have dealings in several countries. They are progressively replacing the many different national accounting standards. They are the rules to be followed by accountants to maintain books of accounts which are comparable, understandable, reliable and relevant as per the users internal or external. IFRS, with the exception of IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies and IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29, are authorized in terms of the historical cost paradigm. IAS 29 and IFRIC 7 are authorized in terms of the units of constant purchasing power paradigm.[2][3]\\r\\nIFRS began as an attempt to harmonize accounting across the European Union but the value of harmonization quickly made the concept attractive around the world. However, it has been debated whether or not de facto harmonization has occurred. Standards that were issued by IASC (the predecessor of IASB) are still within use today and go by the name International Accounting Standards (IAS), while standards issued by IASB are called IFRS. IAS were issued between 1973 and 2001 by the Board of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). On 1 April 2001, the new International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) took over from the IASC the responsibility for setting International Accounting Standards. During its first meeting the new Board adopted existing IAS and Standing Interpretations Committee standards (SICs). The IASB has continued to develop standards calling the new standards \\"International Financial Reporting Standards\\".\\r\\nIn the absence of a Standard or an Interpretation that specifically applies to a transaction, management must use its judgement in developing and applying an accounting policy that results in information that is relevant and reliable. In making that judgement, IAS 8.11 requires management to consider the definitions, recognition criteria, and measurement concepts for assets, liabilities, income, and expenses in the Framework.\\r\\nCriticisms of IFRS are (1) that they are not being adopted in the US (see US GAAP), (2) a number of criticisms from France and (3) that IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies had no positive effect at all during 6 years in Zimbabwe's hyperinflationary economy. The IASB offered responses to the first two criticisms, but has offered no response to the last criticism while IAS 29 was as of March 2014 being implemented in its original ineffective form in Venezuela and Belarus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial statements are a structured representation of the financial positions and financial performance of an entity. The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions. Financial statements also show the results of the management's stewardship of the resources entrusted to it.[4]\\r\\nTo meet this objective, financial statements provide information about an entity's assets and cash flows. This information, along with other information in the notes, assists users of financial statements in predicting the entity's future cash flows and, in particular, their timing and certainty.[4]\\r\\nThe following are the general features in IFRS:\\r\\nFundamental qualitative characteristics of financial information include:\\r\\nEnhancing qualitative characteristics include:\\r\\nThe elements directly related to the measurement of the statement of financial position include:\\r\\nThe financial performance of an entity is presented in the statement of comprehensive income, which consists of the income statement (Statement of Profit/Loss) and the statement of other comprehensive income[17] (usually presented in two separate statements). Financial performance includes the following elements (which are recognised in the income statement or other comprehensive income as required by the applicable IFRS standard):\\r\\nResults recognised in other comprehensive income are limited to the following specific circumstances:\\r\\nThe statement of changes in equity consists of a reconciliation of the changes in equity in which the following information is provided:\\r\\nCash flow statement\\r\\nNotes to the Financial Statements: These shall (a) present information about the basis of preparation of the financial statements and the specific accounting policies used; (b) disclose the information required by IFRSs that is not presented elsewhere in the financial statements; and (c) provide information that is not presented elsewhere in the financ|Statement of Cash Flowsial statements, but is relevant to an understanding of any of them.[29]\\r\\nAn item is recognized in the financial statements when:[30]\\r\\nIn some cases specific standards add additional conditions before recognition is possible or prohibit recognition altogether.\\r\\nAn example is the recognition of internally generated brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and items similar in substance, for which recognition is prohibited by IAS 38.[31] In addition research and development expenses can only be recognised as an intangible asset if they cross the threshold of being classified as 'development cost'.[32]\\r\\nWhilst the standard on provisions, IAS 37, prohibits the recognition of a provision for contingent liabilities,[33] this prohibition is not applicable to the accounting for contingent liabilities in a business combination. In that case the acquirer shall recognise a contingent liability even if it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required.[34]\\r\\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are designed as a common global language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. They are a consequence of growing international.\\r\\nPar. 102. A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity. Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day.\\r\\nPar. 103. The selection of the appropriate concept of capital by an entity should be based on the needs of the users of its financial statements. Thus, a financial concept of capital should be adopted if the users of financial statements are primarily concerned with the maintenance of nominal invested capital or the purchasing power of invested capital. If, however, the main concern of users is with the operating capability of the entity, a physical concept of capital should be used. The concept chosen indicates the goal to be attained in determining profit, even though there may be some measurement difficulties in making the concept operational.\\r\\nPar. 104. The concepts of capital in paragraph 102 give rise to the following two concepts of capital maintenance:\\r\\n(a) Financial capital maintenance. Under this concept a profit is earned only if the financial (or money) amount of the net assets at the end of the period exceeds the financial (or money) amount of net assets at the beginning of the period, after excluding any distributions to, and contributions from, owners during the period. Financial capital maintenance can be measured in either nominal monetary units or units of constant purchasing power.\\r\\n(b) Physical capital maintenance. Under this concept a profit is earned only if the physical productive capacity (or operating capability) of the entity (or the resources or funds needed to achieve that capacity) at the end of the period exceeds the physical productive capacity at the beginning of the period, after excluding any distributions to, and contributions from, owners during the period.\\r\\nThe concepts of capital in paragraph 102 give rise to the following three concepts of capital during low inflation and deflation:\\r\\nThe concepts of capital in paragraph 102 give rise to the following three concepts of capital maintenance during low inflation and deflation:\\r\\nPar. 105. The concept of capital maintenance is concerned with how an entity defines the capital that it seeks to maintain. It provides the linkage between the concepts of capital and the concepts of profit because it provides the point of reference by which profit is measured; it is a prerequisite for distinguishing between an entity's return on capital and its return of capital; only inflows of assets in excess of amounts needed to maintain capital may be regarded as profit and therefore as a return on capital. Hence, profit is the residual amount that remains after expenses (including capital maintenance adjustments, where appropriate) have been deducted from income. If expenses exceed income the residual amount is a loss.\\r\\nPar. 106. The physical capital maintenance concept requires the adoption of the current cost basis of measurement. The financial capital maintenance concept, however, does not require the use of a particular basis of measurement. Selection of the basis under this concept is dependent on the type of financial capital that the entity is seeking to maintain.\\r\\nPar. 107. The principal difference between the two concepts of capital maintenance is the treatment of the effects of changes in the prices of assets and liabilities of the entity. In general terms, an entity has maintained its capital if it has as much capital at the end of the period as it had at the beginning of the period. Any amount over and above that required to maintain the capital at the beginning of the period is profit.\\r\\nPar. 108. Under the concept of financial capital maintenance where capital is defined in terms of nominal monetary units, profit represents the increase in nominal money capital over the period. Thus, increases in the prices of assets held over the period, conventionally referred to as holding gains, are, conceptually, profits. They may not be recognised as such, however, until the assets are disposed of in an exchange transaction. When the concept of financial capital maintenance is defined in terms of constant purchasing power units, profit represents the increase in invested purchasing power over the period. Thus, only that part of the increase in the prices of assets that exceeds the increase in the general level of prices is regarded as profit. The rest of the increase is treated as a capital maintenance adjustment and, hence, as part of equity.\\r\\nPar. 109. Under the concept of physical capital maintenance when capital is defined in terms of the physical productive capacity, profit represents the increase in that capital over the period. All price changes affecting the assets and liabilities of the entity are viewed as changes in the measurement of the physical productive capacity of the entity; hence, they are treated as capital maintenance adjustments that are part of equity and not as profit.\\r\\nPar. 110. The selection of the measurement bases and concept of capital maintenance will determine the accounting model used in the preparation of the financial statements. Different accounting models exhibit different degrees of relevance and reliability and, as in other areas, management must seek a balance between relevance and reliability. This Framework is applicable to a range of accounting models and provides guidance on preparing and presenting the financial statements constructed under the chosen model. At the present time, it is not the intention of the Board of IASC to prescribe a particular model other than in exceptional circumstances, such as for those entities reporting in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy. This intention will, however, be reviewed in the light of world developments.[41]\\r\\nIFRS financial statements consist of (IAS1.8)\\r\\nComparative information is required for the prior reporting period (IAS 1.36). An entity preparing IFRS accounts for the first time must apply IFRS in full for the current and comparative period although there are transitional exemptions (IFRS1.7).\\r\\nOn 6 September 2007, the IASB issued a revised IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. The main changes from the previous version are to require that an entity must:\\r\\nThe revised IAS 1 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. Early adoption is permitted.\\r\\nIn 2012 the US Securities and Exchange Commission Staff issued a 127-page report of potential issues with IFRS that would need to be addressed before adoption by the United States.[42] The staff of the IFRS Foundation provided a detailed answer on the main criticisms in the SEC staff report.[43]\\r\\nA number of criticisms were voiced in the beginning of 2013 in the French media to which the IASB Board member Philippe Danjou responded in his document 'An Update on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs).' [44]\\r\\nIt is widely acknowledged that IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies had no positive effect during the six years it was implemented during hyperinflation in Zimbabwe. [4][citation needed] This led people[who?] to ask the purpose of IAS 29.[citation needed] As of March 2014, IAS 29 was being implemented in its original ineffective form[citation needed] in Venezuela and Belarus. It was suggested to the IASB in 2012[by whom?] that IAS 29 should be corrected to require daily indexation which would result in effective constant purchasing power accounting and would stabilize the non-monetary economy during hyperinflation. The IASB has offered no response to date (March 2014) to this criticism and has not yet altered IAS 29 to require daily indexation.\\r\\nIFRS are used in many parts of the world, including the South Korea, European Union, India, Hong Kong, Australia, Malaysia, Pakistan, GCC countries, Russia, Chile, Philippines, South Africa, Singapore and Turkey, but not in the United States.\\r\\nIt is generally expected that IFRS adoption worldwide will be beneficial to investors and other users of financial statements, by reducing the costs of comparing alternative investments and increasing the quality of information.[45] Companies are also expected to benefit, as investors will be more willing to provide financing.[45] Companies that have high levels of international activities are among the group that would benefit from a switch to IFRS. Companies that are involved in foreign activities and investing benefit from the switch due to the increased comparability of a set accounting standard.[46] However, Ray J. Ball has expressed some skepticism of the overall cost of the international standard; he argues that the enforcement of the standards could be lax, and the regional differences in accounting could become obscured behind a label. He also expressed concerns about the fair value emphasis of IFRS and the influence of accountants from non-common-law regions, where losses have been recognized in a less timely manner.[45]\\r\\nTo assess progress towards the goal of a single set global accounting standards, the IFRS Foundation has developed and posted profiles about the use of IFRSs in individual jurisdictions. These were based on information from various sources. The starting point was the responses provided by standard-setting and other relevant bodies to a survey that the IFRS Foundation conducted. Currently, profiles are completed for 124 jurisdictions, including all of the G20 jurisdictions plus 104 others. Eventually, the plan is to have a profile for every jurisdiction that has adopted IFRSs, or is on a programme toward adoption of IFRSs.[47]\\r\\nThe Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) has issued 'Australian equivalents to IFRS' (A-IFRS), numbering IFRS standards as AASB 1ÿ8 and IAS standards as AASB 101ÿ141. Australian equivalents to SIC and IFRIC Interpretations have also been issued, along with a number of 'domestic' standards and interpretations. These pronouncements replaced previous Australian generally accepted accounting principles with effect from annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 (i.e. 30 June 2006 was the first report prepared under IFRS-equivalent standards for June year ends). To this end, Australia, along with Europe and a few other countries, was one of the initial adopters of IFRS for domestic purposes (in the developed world). It must be acknowledged, however, that IFRS and primarily IAS have been part and parcel of accounting standard package in the developing world for many years since the relevant accounting bodies were more open to adoption of international standards for many reasons including that of capability.\\r\\nThe AASB has made certain amendments to the IASB pronouncements in making A-IFRS, however these generally have the effect of eliminating an option under IFRS, introducing additional disclosures or implementing requirements for not-for-profit entities, rather than departing from IFRS for Australian entities. Accordingly, for-profit entities that prepare financial statements in accordance with A-IFRS are able to make an unreserved statement of compliance with IFRS.\\r\\nThe AASB continues to mirror changes made by the IASB as local pronouncements. In addition, over recent years, the AASB has issued so-called 'Amending Standards' to reverse some of the initial changes made to the IFRS text for local terminology differences, to reinstate options and eliminate some Australian-specific disclosure. There are some calls for Australia to simply adopt IFRS without 'Australianising' them and this has resulted in the AASB itself looking at alternative ways of adopting IFRS in Australia.\\r\\nBrazil has already adopted IFRS for all companies whose securities are publicly traded and for most financial institutions whose securities are not publicly traded, for both consolidated and separate (individual) company financial statements.[48]\\r\\nThe use of IFRS became a requirement for Canadian publicly accountable profit-oriented enterprises for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. This includes public companies and other \\"profit-oriented enterprises that are responsible to large or diverse groups of shareholders.\\"[49]\\r\\nIn 2002 the European Union agreed that from 1 January 2005 International Accounting Standards / International Financial Reporting Standards would apply for the consolidated accounts of the EU listed companies.[50]\\r\\nIn order to be approved for use in the EU, standards must be endorsed by the Accounting Regulatory Committee (ARC), which includes representatives of member state governments and is advised by a group of accounting experts known as the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group. As a result, IFRS as applied in the EU may differ from that used elsewhere.\\r\\nParts of the standard IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement were not originally approved by the ARC. IAS 39 was subsequently amended, removing the option to record financial liabilities at fair value, and the ARC approved the amended version. The IASB is working with the EU to find an acceptable way to remove a remaining anomaly in respect of hedge accounting. The World Bank Centre for Financial Reporting Reform is working with countries in the ECA region to facilitate the adoption of IFRS and IFRS for SMEs.\\r\\nWhilst the IASB set the effective dates for the new consolidation standards IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities at 1 January 2013, the ARC decided to delay the mandatory effective date for the companies listed in the European Union by one year. The standards therefore only became effective on 1 January 2014.[51]\\r\\nThe European Commission has launched a general analysis of the impacts of 8 years of use of international financial reporting standards (IFRSs) in the EU for preparers and users of financial statements from the private sector. The study will include an overall assessment of whether the Regulation 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council ('IAS Regulation') has met the two-fold initial objectives of ensuring a high degree of transparency and comparability of the financial statements of European companies and an efficient functioning of the market, in comparison with the situation before IFRS implementation in 2005. It will also include a cost-benefit analysis and an assessment and analysis of the benefits and drawbacks brought by the IAS Regulation for different stakeholder groups.[52]\\r\\nGhana transitioned from the Ghana Accounting Standards (GAS) to adopt the IFRS on January 1, 2007.[53] As of 2008 and beyond, a legislative injunction has been imposed on the Bank of Ghana to prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS; thereby making it mandatory for all public entities in the country.[54]\\r\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has announced that IFRS will be mandatory in India for financial statements for the periods beginning on or after 1 April 2016 in a phased manner. There is a roadmap issued by MCA for adoption of IFRS.\\r\\nReserve Bank of India has stated that financial statements of banks need to be IFRS-compliant for periods beginning on or after 1 April 2011.\\r\\nThe ICAI has also stated that IFRS will be applied to companies above INR 1000 crore (INR 10 billion) from April 2011. Phase wise applicability details for different companies in India:\\r\\nPhase 1: Opening balance sheet as at 1 April 2011*\\r\\ni. Companies which are part of NSE Index ÿ Nifty 50\\r\\nii. Companies which are part of BSE Index ÿ Sensex 30\\r\\na. Companies whose shares or other securities are listed on a stock exchange outside India\\r\\nb. Companies, whether listed or not, having net worth of more than INR 1000 crore (INR 10 billion)\\r\\nPhase 2: Opening balance sheet as at 1 April 2012*\\r\\nCompanies not covered in phase 1 and having net worth exceeding INR 500 crore (INR 5 billion)\\r\\nPhase 3: Opening balance sheet as at 1 April 2014*\\r\\nListed companies not covered in the earlier phases * If the financial year of a company commences at a date other than 1 April, then it shall prepare its opening balance sheet at the commencement of immediately following financial year.\\r\\nOn 22 January 2010, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs issued the road map for transition to IFRS. It is clear that India has deferred transition to IFRS by a year. In the first phase, companies included in Nifty 50 or BSE Sensex, and companies whose securities are listed on stock exchanges outside India and all other companies having net worth of INR 10?billion will prepare and present financial statements using Indian Accounting Standards converged with IFRS. According to the press note issued by the government, those companies will convert their first balance sheet as at 1 April 2011, applying accounting standards convergent with IFRS if the accounting year ends on 31 March. This implies that the transition date will be 1 April 2011. According to the earlier plan, the transition date was fixed at 1 April 2010.\\r\\nThe press note does not clarify whether the full set of financial statements for the year 2011ÿ12 will be prepared by applying accounting standards convergent with IFRS. The deferment of the transition may make companies happy, but it will undermine India's position. Presumably, lack of preparedness of Indian companies has led to the decision to defer the adoption of IFRS for a year. This is unfortunate that India, which boasts for its IT and accounting skills, could not prepare itself for the transition to IFRS over last four years. But that might be the ground reality.\\r\\nTransition in phases\\r\\nCompanies, whether listed or not, having net worth of more than INR 5?billion will convert their opening balance sheet as at 1 April 2013. Listed companies having net worth of INR 5?billion or less will convert their opening balance sheet as at 1 April 2014. Un-listed companies having net worth of Rs5?billion or less will continue to apply existing accounting standards, which might be modified from time to time. Transition to IFRS in phases is a smart move.\\r\\nThe transition cost for smaller companies will be much lower because large companies will bear the initial cost of learning and smaller companies will not be required to reinvent the wheel. However, this will happen only if a significant number of large companies engage Indian accounting firms to provide them support in their transition to IFRS. If, most large companies, which will comply with Indian accounting standards convergent with IFRS in the first phase, choose one of the international firms, Indian accounting firms and smaller companies will not benefit from the learning in the first phase of the transition to IFRS.\\r\\nIt is likely that international firms will protect their learning to retain their competitive advantage. Therefore, it is for the benefit of the country that each company makes judicious choice of the accounting firm as its partner without limiting its choice to international accounting firms. Public sector companies should take the lead and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) should develop a clear strategy to diffuse the learning.\\r\\nSize of companies\\r\\nThe government has decided to measure the size of companies in terms of net worth. This is not the ideal unit to measure the size of a company. Net worth in the balance sheet is determined by accounting principles and methods. Therefore, it does not include the value of intangible assets. Moreover, as most assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost, the net worth does not reflect the current value of those assets and liabilities. Market capitalisation is a better measure of the size of a company. But it is difficult to estimate market capitalisation or fundamental value of unlisted companies. This might be the reason that the government has decided to use 'net worth' to measure size of companies. Some companies, which are large in terms of fundamental value or which intend to attract foreign capital, might prefer to use Indian accounting standards convergent with IFRS earlier than required under the road map presented by the government. The government should provide that choice.[55]\\r\\nThe minister for Financial Services in Japan announced in late June 2011 that mandatory application of the IFRS should not take place from fiscal year-ending March 2015; five to seven years should be required for preparation if mandatory application is decided; and to permit the use of U.S. GAAP beyond the fiscal year ending 31 March 2016.[56]\\r\\nMontenegro gained independence from Serbia in 2006. Its accounting standard setter is the Institute of Accountants and Auditors of Montenegro (IAAM).[57]:2 In 2005, IAAM adopted a revised version of the 2002 \\"Law on Accounting and Auditing\\" which authorized the use of IFRS for all entities.[57]:18 IFRS is currently required for all consolidated and standalone financial statements, however, enforcement is not effective except in the banking sector.[57]:18 Financial statements for banks in Montenegro are, generally, of high quality and can be compared to those of the European Union.[57]:3 Foreign companies listed on Montenegro's two stock exchanges (Montenegro Stock Exchange and NEX Stock Exchange) are also required to apply IFRS in their financial statements.[58] Montenegro does not have a national GAAP.[57]:18 Currently, no Montenegrin translation of IFRS exists, and because of this Montenegro applies the Serbian translation from 2010.[59]:20 IFRS for SMEs is not currently applied in Montenegro.[59]:20\\r\\nIn Nepal the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) is in charge of standard setting. Nepal closely models its Financial Reporting Standards (FRS) according to the IFRS, with appropriate changes made to suit the Nepalese context. It has issued Nepal Financial Reporting Standards in 2013. The 2013 version of standards almost resembles IFRS with slight modification.\\r\\nAll listed companies must follow all issued IAS/IFRS except the following:\\r\\nIAS 39 and IAS 41: Implementation of these standards has been held in abeyance by State Bank of Pakistan for Banks and DFIs\\r\\nIFRS-1: Effective for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2004. This IFRS is being considered for adoption for all companies other than banks and DFIs.\\r\\nIFRS-9: Under consideration of the relevant Committee of the Institutes (ICAP & ICMAP). This IFRS will be effective for the annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.\\r\\nThe government of Russia has been implementing a program to harmonize its national accounting standards with IFRS since 1998. Since then twenty new accounting standards were issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation aiming to align accounting practices with IFRS. Despite these efforts essential differences between Russian accounting standards and IFRS remain. Since 2004 all commercial banks have been obliged to prepare financial statements in accordance with both Russian accounting standards and IFRS. Full transition to IFRS is delayed but starting 2012 new modifications making Russian GAAP converging to IFRS have been made. They notably include the booking of reserves for bad debts and contingent liabilities and the devaluation of inventory and financial assets.\\r\\nStill, several differences between the two sets of account still remain. Major reasons for deviation between Russian GAAP and IFRS / US-GAAP (e.g. when the Russian affiliate of a larger group need to be consolidated to the mother company) are the following:\\r\\nIn Singapore the Accounting Standards Committee (ASC) is in charge of standard setting. Singapore closely models its Financial Reporting Standards (FRS) according to the IFRS, with appropriate changes made to suit the Singapore context.

The great biological importance of photoreceptors is that they convert light (visible electromagnetic radiation) into signals that can stimulate biological processes. To be more specific, photoreceptor proteins in the cell absorb photons, triggering a change in the cell's membrane potential.\\r\\nThere are currently three known types of photoreceptor cells in mammalian eyes: rods, cones, and photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. The two classic photoreceptor cells are rods and cones, each contributing information used by the visual system to form a representation of the visual world, sight. The rods are narrower than the cones and distributed differently across the retina, but the chemical process in each that supports phototransduction is similar.[1] A third class of mammalian photoreceptor cell was discovered during the 1990s:[2] the photosensitive ganglion cells. These cells do not contribute to sight directly, but are thought to support circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex.\\r\\nThere are major functional differences between the rods and cones. Rods are extremely sensitive, and can be triggered by a single photon.[3][4] At very low light levels, visual experience is based solely on the rod signal. This explains why colors cannot be seen at low light levels: only one type of photoreceptor cell is active.\\r\\nCones require significantly brighter light (i.e., a larger numbers of photons) in order to produce a signal. In humans, there are three different types of cone cell, distinguished by their pattern of response to different wavelengths of light. Color experience is calculated from these three distinct signals, perhaps via an opponent process.[5] The three types of cone cell respond (roughly) to light of short, medium, and long wavelengths. Note that, due to the principle of univariance, the firing of the cell depends upon only the number of photons absorbed. The different responses of the three types of cone cells are determined by the likelihoods that their respective photoreceptor proteins will absorb photons of different wavelengths. So, for example, an L cone cell contains a photoreceptor protein that more readily absorbs long wavelengths of light (i.e., more \\"red\\"). Light of a shorter wavelength can also produce the same response, but it must be much brighter to do so.\\r\\nThe human retina contains about 120 million rod cells, and 6 million cone cells. The number and ratio of rods to cones varies among species, dependent on whether an animal is primarily diurnal or nocturnal. Certain owls, such as the tawny owl,[6] have a tremendous number of rods in their retinae. In addition, there are about 2.4 million to 3 million ganglion cells in the human visual system, 1 to 2% of them photosensitive. The axons of ganglion cells form the two optic nerves.\\r\\nThe pineal and parapineal glands are photoreceptive in non-mammalian vertebrates, but not in mammals. Birds have photoactive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting neurons within the paraventricular organ that respond to light in the absence of input from the eyes or neurotransmitters.[7] Invertebrate photoreceptors in organisms such as insects and molluscs are different in both their morphological organization and their underlying biochemical pathways. Described here are human photoreceptors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRod and cone photoreceptors are found on the outermost layer of the retina; they both have the same basic structure. Closest to the visual field (and farthest from the brain) is the axon terminal, which releases a neurotransmitter called glutamate to bipolar cells. Farther back is the cell body, which contains the cell's organelles. Farther back still is the inner segment, a specialized part of the cell full of mitochondria. The chief function of the inner segment is to provide ATP (energy) for the sodium-potassium pump. Finally, closest to the brain (and farthest from the field of view) is the outer segment, the part of the photoreceptor that absorbs light. Outer segments are actually modified cilia[9][10] that contain disks filled with opsin, the molecule that absorbs photons, as well as voltage-gated sodium channels.\\r\\nThe membranous photoreceptor protein opsin contains a pigment molecule called retinal. In rod cells, these together are called rhodopsin. In cone cells, there are different types of opsins that combine with retinal to form pigments called photopsins. Three different classes of photopsins in the cones react to different ranges of light frequency, a differentiation that allows the visual system to calculate color. The function of the photoreceptor cell is to convert the light energy of the photon into a form of energy communicable to the nervous system and readily usable to the organism: This conversion is called signal transduction.\\r\\nThe opsin found in the photosensitive ganglion cells of the retina is called melanopsin. These cells are involved in various reflexive responses of the brain and body to the presence of (day)light, such as the regulation of circadian rhythms, pupillary reflex and other non-visual responses to light. Melanopsin functionally resembles invertebrate opsins.\\r\\nWhen light activates the melanopsin signaling system, the melanopsin-containing ganglion cells discharge nerve impulses that are conducted through their axons to specific brain targets. These targets include the olivary pretectal nucleus (a center responsible for controlling the pupil of the eye), the LGN, and, through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (the master pacemaker of circadian rhythms). Melanopsin-containing ganglion cells are thought to influence these targets by releasing from their axon terminals the neurotransmitters glutamate and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP).\\r\\nThe human retina has approximately 6 million cones and 120 million rods.[13] Signals from the rods and cones converge on ganglion and bipolar cells for preprocessing before they are sent to the lateral geniculate nucleus. At the \\"center\\" of the retina (the point directly behind the lens) lies the fovea (or fovea centralis), which contains only cone cells; and is the region capable of producing the highest visual acuity or highest resolution. Across the rest of the retina, rods and cones are intermingled. No photoreceptors are found at the blind spot, the area where ganglion cell fibers are collected into the optic nerve and leave the eye.[14]\\r\\nThe photoreceptor proteins in the three types of cones differ in their sensitivity to photons of different wavelengths (see graph). Since cones respond to both the wavelength and intensity of light, the cone's sensitivity to wavelength is measured in terms of its relative rate of response if the intensity of a stimulus is held fixed, while the wavelength is varied. From this, in turn, is inferred the absorbance.[15] The graph normalizes the degree of absorbance on a hundred-point scale. For example, the S cone's relative response peaks around 420?nm (nanometers, a measure of wavelength). This tells us that an S cone is more likely to absorb a photon at 420?nm than at any other wavelength. If light of a different wavelength to which it is less sensitive, say 480?nm, is increased in brightness appropriately, however, it will produce exactly the same response in the S cone. So, the colors of the curves are misleading. Cones cannot detect color by themselves; rather, color vision requires comparison of the signal across different cone types.\\r\\nThe process of phototransduction occurs in the retina.[13] The retina has many layers of various cell types.[13] The best-known photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) form the outermost layer, closest to the sclera, and furthest from the pupil.[13] They are the photoreceptors responsible for sight. The middle layer contains bipolar cells, which collect neural signals from the rods and the cones and then transmit them to the innermost layer of the retina,[13] where the neurons called retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a small percentage of which are themselves photosensitive, organize the signals and send them to the brain.[13] The bundled RGC axons form the optic nerve, which leaves the eye through a hole in the retina creating the blind spot.[13]\\r\\nActivation of rods and cones is actually hyperpolarization; when they are not being stimulated, they depolarize and release glutamate continuously. In the dark, cells have a relatively high concentration of cyclic guanosine 3'-5' monophosphate (cGMP), which opens ion channels (largely sodium channels, though calcium can enter through these channels as well). The positive charges of the ions that enter the cell down its electrochemical gradient change the cell's membrane potential, cause depolarization, and lead to the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamate can depolarize some neurons and hyperpolarize others.\\r\\nWhen light hits a photoreceptive pigment within the photoreceptor cell, the pigment changes shape. The pigment, called iodopsin or rhodopsin, consists of large proteins called opsin (situated in the plasma membrane), attached to a covalently bound prosthetic group: an organic molecule called retinal (a derivative of vitamin A). The retinal exists in the 11-cis-retinal form when in the dark, and stimulation by light causes its structure to change to all-trans-retinal. This structural change causes it to activate a regulatory protein called transducin, which leads to the activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase, which breaks cGMP down into 5'-GMP. Reduction in cGMP allows the ion channels to close, preventing the influx of positive ions, hyperpolarizing the cell, and stopping the release of neurotransmitters.[16] The entire process by which light initiates a sensory response is called visual phototransduction.\\r\\nUnstimulated (in the dark), cyclic-nucleotide gated channels in the outer segment are open because cyclic GMP (cGMP) is bound to them. Hence, positively charged ions (namely sodium ions) enter the photoreceptor, depolarizing it to about ?40 mV (resting potential in other nerve cells is usually ?65 mV). This depolarizing current is often known as dark current.\\r\\nThe signal transduction pathway is the mechanism by which the energy of a photon signals a mechanism in the cell that leads to its electrical polarization. This polarization ultimately leads to either the transmittance or inhibition of a neural signal that will be fed to the brain via the optic nerve. The steps, or signal transduction pathway, in the vertebrate eye's rod and cone photoreceptors are then:\\r\\nThus, a rod or cone photoreceptor actually releases less neurotransmitter when stimulated by light. Less neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft between a photoreceptor and bipolar cell will serve to either excite (depolarize) ON bipolar cells or inhibit (hyperpolarize) OFF bipolar cells. Thus, it is at the photoreceptor-bipolar cell synapse where visual signals are split into ON and OFF pathways.[17]\\r\\nATP provided by the inner segment powers the sodium-potassium pump. This pump is necessary to reset the initial state of the outer segment by taking the sodium ions that are entering the cell and pumping them back out.\\r\\nAlthough photoreceptors are neurons, they do not conduct action potentials with the exception of the photosensitive ganglion cell ÿ which are involved mainly in the regulation of circadian rhythms, melatonin, and pupil dilation.\\r\\nPhototransduction in rods and cones is unique in that the stimulus (in this case, light) actually reduces the cell's response or firing rate, which is unusual for a sensory system where the stimulus usually increases the cell's response or firing rate. However, this system offers several key advantages.\\r\\nFirst, the classic (rod or cone) photoreceptor is depolarized in the dark, which means many sodium ions are flowing into the cell. Thus, the random opening or closing of sodium channels will not affect the membrane potential of the cell; only the closing of a large number of channels, through absorption of a photon, will affect it and signal that light is in the visual field. Hence, the system is noiseless.\\r\\nSecond, there is a lot of amplification in two stages of classic phototransduction: one pigment will activate many molecules of transducin, and one PDE will cleave many cGMPs. This amplification means that even the absorption of one photon will affect membrane potential and signal to the brain that light is in the visual field. This is the main feature that differentiates rod photoreceptors from cone photoreceptors. Rods are extremely sensitive and have the capacity of registering a single photon of light, unlike cones. On the other hand, cones are known to have very fast kinetics in terms of rate of amplification of phototransduction, unlike rods.\\r\\nComparison of human rod and cone cells, from Eric Kandel et al. in Principles of Neural Science.[16]\\r\\nPhotoreceptors do not signal color; they only signal the presence of light in the visual field.\\r\\nA given photoreceptor responds to both the wavelength and intensity of a light source. For example, red light at a certain intensity can produce the same exact response in a photoreceptor as green light of a different intensity. Therefore, the response of a single photoreceptor is ambiguous when it comes to color.\\r\\nTo determine color, the visual system compares responses across a population of photoreceptors (specifically, the three different cones with differing absorption spectra). To determine intensity, the visual system computes how many photoreceptors are responding. This is the mechanism that allows trichromatic color vision in humans and some other animals.\\r\\nThe key events mediating rod versus S cone versus M cone differentiation are induced by several transcription factors, including RORbeta, OTX2, NRL, CRX, NR2E3 and TRbeta2. The S cone fate represents the default photoreceptor program, however differential transcriptional activity can bring about rod or M cone generation. L cones are present in primates, however there is not much known for their developmental program due to use of rodents in research. There are five steps to developing photoreceptors: proliferation of multi-potent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs); restriction of competence of RPCs; cell fate specification; photoreceptor gene expression; and lastly axonal growth, synapse formation and outer segment growth.\\r\\nEarly Notch signaling maintains progenitor cycling. Photoreceptor precursors come about through inhibition of Notch signaling and increased activity of various factors including achaete-scute homologue 1. OTX2 activity commits cells to the photoreceptor fate. CRX further defines the photoreceptor specific panel of genes being expressed. NRL expression leads to the rod fate. NR2E3 further restricts cells to the rod fate by repressing cone genes. RORbeta is needed for both rod and cone development. TRbeta2 mediates the M cone fate. If any of the previously mentioned factors' functions are ablated, the default photoreceptor is a S cone. These events take place at different time periods for different species and include a complex pattern of activities that bring about a spectrum of phenotypes. If these regulatory networks are disrupted, retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration or other visual deficits may result.[18]\\r\\nThe rod and cone photoreceptors signal their absorption of photons via a decrease in the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate to bipolar cells at its axon terminal. Since the photoreceptor is depolarized in the dark, a high amount of glutamate is being released to bipolar cells in the dark. Absorption of a photon will hyperpolarize the photoreceptor and therefore result in the release of less glutamate at the presynaptic terminal to the bipolar cell.\\r\\nEvery rod or cone photoreceptor releases the same neurotransmitter, glutamate. However, the effect of glutamate differs in the bipolar cells, depending upon the type of receptor imbedded in that cell's membrane. When glutamate binds to an ionotropic receptor, the bipolar cell will depolarize (and therefore will hyperpolarize with light as less glutamate is released). On the other hand, binding of glutamate to a metabotropic receptor results in a hyperpolarization, so this bipolar cell will depolarize to light as less glutamate is released.\\r\\nIn essence, this property allows for one population of bipolar cells that gets excited by light and another population that gets inhibited by it, even though all photoreceptors show the same response to light. This complexity becomes both important and necessary for detecting color, contrast, edges, etc.\\r\\nFurther complexity arises from the various interconnections among bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells in the retina. The final result is differing populations of ganglion cells in the retina, a sub-population of which is also intrinsically photosensitive, using the photopigment melanopsin.\\r\\nA non-rod non-cone photoreceptor in the eyes of mice, which was shown to mediate circadian rhythms, was discovered in 1991 by Foster et al.[2] These neuronal cells, called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC), are a small subset (1ÿ3%) of the retinal ganglion cells located in the inner retina, that is, in front[19] of the rods and cones located in the outer retina. These light sensitive neurons contain a photopigment, melanopsin,[20][21][22][23][24] which has an absorption peak of the light at a different wavelength (480?nm[25]) than rods and cones. Beside circadian / behavioral functions, ipRGCs have a role in initiating the pupillary light reflex.[26]\\r\\nDennis Dacey with colleagues showed in a species of Old World monkey that giant ganglion cells expressing melanopsin projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).[27] Previously only projections to the midbrain (pre-tectal nucleus) and hypothalamus (suprachiasmatic nucleus) had been shown. However a visual role for the receptor was still unsuspected and unproven.\\r\\nIn 2007, Farhan H. Zaidi and colleagues published pioneering work using rodless coneless humans. Current Biology subsequently announced in their 2008 editorial, commentary and despatches to scientists and ophthalmologists, that the non-rod non-cone photoreceptor had been conclusively discovered in humans using landmark experiments on rodless coneless humans by Zaidi and colleagues[24][28][29][30] As had been found in other mammals, the identity of the non-rod non-cone photoreceptor in humans was found to be a ganglion cell in the inner retina. The workers had tracked down patients with rare diseases wiping out classic rod and cone photoreceptor function but preserving ganglion cell function.[28][29][30] Despite having no rods or cones the patients continued to exhibit circadian photoentrainment, circadian behavioural patterns, melanopsin suppression, and pupil reactions, with peak spectral sensitivities to environmental and experimental light matching that for the melanopsin photopigment. Their brains could also associate vision with light of this frequency.\\r\\nIn humans the retinal ganglion cell photoreceptor contributes to conscious sight as well as to non-image-forming functions like circadian rhythms, behaviour and pupil reactions.[31] Since these cells respond mostly to blue light, it has been suggested that they have a role in mesopic vision.[citation needed] Zaidi and colleagues' work with rodless coneless human subjects hence also opened the door into image-forming (visual) roles for the ganglion cell photoreceptor. It was discovered that there are parallel pathways for vision ÿ one classic rod and cone-based pathway arising from the outer retina, and the other a rudimentary visual brightness detector pathway arising from the inner retina, which seems to be activated by light before the other.[31] Classic photoreceptors also feed into the novel photoreceptor system, and colour constancy may be an important role as suggested by Foster. The receptor could be instrumental in understanding many diseases including major causes of blindness worldwide like glaucoma, a disease that affects ganglion cells, and the study of the receptor offered potential as a new avenue to explore in trying to find treatments for blindness. It is in these discoveries of the novel photoreceptor in humans and in the receptors role in vision, rather than its non-image-forming functions, where the receptor may have the greatest impact on society as a whole, though the impact of disturbed circadian rhythms is another area of relevance to clinical medicine.\\r\\nMost work suggests that the peak spectral sensitivity of the receptor is between 460 and 482?nm. Steven Lockley et al. in 2003 showed that 460?nm wavelengths of light suppress melatonin twice as much as longer 555?nm light. However, in more recent work by Farhan Zaidi et al., using rodless coneless humans, it was found that what consciously led to light perception was a very intense 481?nm stimulus; this means that the receptor, in visual terms, enables some rudimentary vision maximally for blue light.[31]","input":"How many rods are in the human eye?"},{"output":"between 1886 and 1894","context":"Coordinates: 513020N 00431W? / ?51.50556N 0.07528W? / 51.50556; -0.07528\\r\\n\\r\\nTower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London built between 1886 and 1894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London. Because of this, Tower Bridge is sometimes confused with London Bridge, situated some 0.5?mi (0.80?km) upstream. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges now owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. It is the only one of the Trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in Tower Hamlets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge consists of two bridge towers tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal tension forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. Before its restoration in the 2010s, the bridge's colour scheme dated from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. Its colours were subsequently restored to blue and white.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest London Underground tube stations are Tower Hill on the Circle and District lines, London Bridge on the Jubilee and Northern lines and Bermondsey on the Jubilee line, and the nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Tower Gateway.[3] The nearest National Rail stations are at Fenchurch Street and London Bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second half of the 19th century, an advertisement in the East End of London led to a hiring for a new river crossing downstream of London Bridge. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by sailing ships to the port facilities in the Pool of London, between London Bridge and the Tower of London.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Special Bridge or Subway Committee was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution to the river crossing problem. Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. Bazalgette's design was rejected because of a lack of sufficient headroom, and design was not approved until 1884, when it was decided to build a bascule bridge. Sir John Wolfe Barry was appointed engineer with Sir Horace Jones as architect[4]  (who was also one of the judges).[5] An Act of Parliament was passed in 1885 authorising the bridge's construction. It specified the opening span must give a clear width of 200 feet (61?m) and a headroom of 135 feet (41?m). Construction had to be in a Gothic style.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBarry designed a bascule bridge with two bridge towers built on piers. The central span was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction started in 1886 and took eight years with five major contractors ÿ Sir John Jackson (foundations), Baron Armstrong (hydraulics), William Webster, Sir H.H. Bartlett, and Sir William Arrol & Co.[6] ÿ and employed 432 construction workers. E W Crutwell was the resident engineer for the construction.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo massive piers, containing over 70,000 tons of concrete,[5] were sunk into the riverbed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways.[5] This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a pleasing appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nJones died in 1886 and George D. Stevenson took over the project.[5] Stevenson replaced Jones's original brick fa?ade with the more ornate Victorian Gothic style, which makes the bridge a distinctive landmark, and was intended to harmonise the bridge with the nearby Tower of London.[7] The total cost of construction was S1,184,000[7] (equivalent to S124?million in 2016).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge was officially opened on 30 June 1894 by the then Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), and his wife, The Princess of Wales (Alexandra of Denmark).[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge connected Iron Gate, on the north bank of the river, with Horselydown Lane, on the south ÿ now known as Tower Bridge Approach and Tower Bridge Road, respectively.[7] Until the bridge was opened, the Tower Subway ÿ 400?m to the west ÿ was the shortest way to cross the river from Tower Hill to Tooley Street in Southwark. Opened in 1870, Tower Subway was among the world's earliest underground (\\"tube\\") railways, but it closed after just three months and was re-opened as a pedestrian foot tunnel. Once Tower Bridge was open, the majority of foot traffic transferred to using the bridge, there being no toll to pay to use it. Having lost most of its income, the tunnel was closed in 1898.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high-level open air walkways between the towers gained an unpleasant reputation as a haunt for prostitutes and pickpockets; as they were only accessible by stairs they were seldom used by regular pedestrians, and were closed in 1910.[11] The walkway reopened in 1982.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Second World War and as a precaution against the existing engines being damaged by enemy action, a third engine was installed in 1942: a 150?hp horizontal cross-compound engine, built by Vickers Armstrong Ltd. at their Elswick works in Newcastle upon Tyne. It was fitted with a flywheel having a 9-foot (2.7?m) diameter and weighing 9 tons, and was governed to a speed of 30 rpm. The engine became redundant when the rest of the system was modernised in 1974, and was donated to the Forncett Industrial Steam Museum by the Corporation of the City of London.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by BHA Cromwell House, with the original final pinions driven by modern hydraulic motors and gearing. In 1982, the Tower Bridge Exhibition opened, housed in the bridge's twin towers, the long-closed high-level walkways and the Victorian engine rooms. The latter still house the original steam engines and some of the original hydraulic machinery.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nA computer system was installed in 2000 to control the raising and lowering of the bascules remotely. It proved unreliable, resulting in the bridge being stuck in the open or closed positions on several occasions during 2005 until its sensors were replaced.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2008 it was announced that the bridge would undergo a 'facelift' costing S4?million, and taking four years to complete. The work entailed stripping off the existing paint down to bare metal and repainting in blue and white.[1][2] Each section was enshrouded in scaffolding and plastic sheeting to prevent the old paint falling into the Thames and causing pollution. Starting in mid-2008, contractors worked on a quarter of the bridge at a time to minimise disruption, but some road closures were inevitable. It is intended that the completed work will stand for 25 years.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe renovation of the walkway interior was completed in mid-2009. Within the walkways a versatile new lighting system has been installed, designed by Eleni Shiarlis, for when the walkways are in use for exhibitions or functions. The new system provides for both feature and atmospheric lighting, the latter using bespoke RGB LED luminaires, designed to be concealed within the bridge superstructure and fixed without the need for drilling (these requirements as a result of the bridge's Grade I status).[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe renovation of the four suspension chains was completed in March 2010 using a state-of-the-art coating system requiring up to six different layers of 'paint'.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge featured in publicity for the 2012 Summer Olympics being held in London. In June 2012 a set of Olympic rings was suspended from the bridge to mark one month to go until the start of the games. The rings cost S259,817 to make, measured 25 by 11.5 metres (82 by 38?ft) and weighed 13 tonnes (14 short tons).[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 July 2012, the west walkway was transformed into a 200-foot-long (61?m) Live Music Sculpture by the British composer Samuel Bordoli. 30 classical musicians were arranged along the length of the bridge 138 feet (42?m) above the Thames behind the Olympic rings. The sound travelled backwards and forwards along the walkway, echoing the structure of the bridge.[21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the Olympics, the rings were removed from Tower Bridge and replaced by the emblem of the Paralympic Games for the 2012 Summer Paralympics.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nTower Bridge was closed to all road traffic for almost three months in late 2016 (1 October to 30 December).[24]  This was to allow structural maintenance work to take place.  The work included:\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time the bridge was still open to water borne traffic as required by Act of Parliament. The bridge was open to pedestrians for all but three weekends, where a free ferry service was in operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge is 800 feet (240?m) in length with two towers each 213 feet (65?m) high, built on piers. The central span of 200 feet (61?m) between the towers is split into two equal bascules or leaves, which can be raised to an angle of 86 degrees to allow river traffic to pass. The bascules, weighing over 1,000 tons each, are counterbalanced to minimise the force required and allow raising in five minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two side-spans are suspension bridges, each 270 feet (82?m) long, with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridge's upper walkways. The pedestrian walkways are 143 feet (44?m) above the river at high tide.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main bridge deck carries two lanes of road traffic between two low-level pedestrian walkways across both suspension spans and the opening bascule section of the bridge, with the walkways separated from the roadway by fences. The roadway passes through each of the two towers, whereas the low-level walkways pass around the outside of the towers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the chimneys on the bridge, which are often mistaken for lamp posts, connects up to an old fireplace in a guardroom of the Tower of London. It is long-disused.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original raising mechanism was powered by pressurised water stored in several hydraulic accumulators.[26] The system was designed and installed by Hamilton Owen Rendel[27] while working for Sir W. G. Armstrong Mitchell & Company of Newcastle upon Tyne. Water, at a pressure of 750?psi (5.2?MPa), was pumped into the accumulators by two 360?hp (270?kW) horizontal twin-tandem compound stationary steam engines, fitted with Meyer expansion slide valves. Each engine drove a force pump from its piston tail rod. The accumulators each comprise a 20-inch (51?cm) ram on which sits a very heavy weight to maintain the desired pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire hydraulic system along with the gas lighting system was installed by William Sugg & Co Ltd., the well known Westminster gas engineers. The gas lighting was initially by open flame burners within the lanterns but soon after was updated to the later incandescent system.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by BHA Cromwell House.[13] The only components of the original system still in use are the final pinions, which engage with the racks fitted to the bascules. These are driven by modern hydraulic motors and gearing, using oil rather than water as the hydraulic fluid.[14] Some of the original hydraulic machinery has been retained, although it is no longer in use. It is open to the public and forms the basis for the bridge's museum, which resides in the old engine rooms on the south side of the bridge. The museum includes the steam engines, two of the accumulators and one of the hydraulic engines that moved the bascules, along with other related artefacts.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo control the passage of river traffic through the bridge, a number of different rules and signals were employed. Daytime control was provided by red semaphore signals, mounted on small control cabins on either end of both bridge piers. At night, coloured lights were used, in either direction, on both piers: two red lights to show that the bridge was closed, and two green to show that it was open. In foggy weather, a gong was sounded as well.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nVessels passing through the bridge had to display signals too: by day, a black ball at least 2 feet (0.61?m) in diameter was to be mounted high up where it could be seen; by night, two red lights in the same position. Foggy weather required repeated blasts from the ship's steam whistle. If a black ball was suspended from the middle of each walkway (or a red light at night) this indicated that the bridge could not be opened. These signals were repeated about 1,000 yards (910?m) downstream, at Cherry Garden Pier, where boats needing to pass through the bridge had to hoist their signals/lights and sound their horn, as appropriate, to alert the Bridge Master.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the control mechanism for the signalling equipment has been preserved and may be seen working in the bridge's museum.\\r\\n\\r\\nTower Bridge is still a busy crossing of the Thames: it is crossed by over 40,000 people (motorists, cyclists and pedestrians) every day.[16] The bridge is on the London Inner Ring Road, and is on the eastern boundary of the London congestion charge zone. (Drivers do not incur a charge by crossing the bridge.)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo maintain the integrity of the structure, the City of London Corporation has imposed a 20-mile-per-hour (32?km/h) speed restriction, and an 18-tonne (20-short-ton) weight limit on vehicles using the bridge. A camera system measures the speed of traffic crossing the bridge, using a number plate recognition system to send fixed penalty charges to speeding drivers.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nA second system monitors other vehicle parameters. Induction loops and piezoelectric sensors are used to measure the weight, the height of the chassis above ground level, and the number of axles of each vehicle.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bascules are raised around 1000 times a year.[31]\\r\\nRiver traffic is now much reduced, but it still takes priority over road traffic. Today, 24 hours' notice is required before opening the bridge, and opening times are published in advance on the bridge's website.[32] There is no charge for vessels to open the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen needing to be raised for the passage of a vessel the bascules are only raised to an angle sufficient for the vessel to safely pass under the bridge, except in the case of a vessel with the Monarch on board in which case they are raised fully no matter the size of the vessel.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tower Bridge Exhibition is a display housed in the bridge's twin towers, the high-level walkways and the Victorian engine rooms. It uses films, photos and interactive displays to explain why and how Tower Bridge was built. Visitors can access the original steam engines that once powered the bridge bascules, housed in a building close to the south end of the bridge.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhibition charges an admission fee. Entrance is from the west side of the bridge deck to the northern tower, from where visitors ascend to level 4 by lift before crossing the high-level walkways to the southern tower. In the towers and walkways is an exhibition on the history of the bridge. The walkways also provide views over the city, the Tower of London and the Pool of London, and include a glass-floored section. From the south tower, visitors can visit the engine rooms, with the original steam engines, which are situated in a separate building beside the southern approach to the bridge.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Tower Bridge is an undoubted landmark, professional commentators in the early 20th century were critical of its aesthetics. \\"It represents the vice of tawdriness and pretentiousness, and of falsification of the actual facts of the structure\\", wrote Henry Heathcote Statham,[34] while Frank Brangwyn stated that \\"A more absurd structure than the Tower Bridge was never thrown across a strategic river\\".[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin Crisler, the New York Times film critic, wrote in 1938: \\"Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not: Magna Carta, the Tower Bridge and Alfred Hitchcock.\\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchitectural historian Dan Cruickshank selected Tower Bridge as one of his four choices for the 2002 BBC television documentary series Britain's Best Buildings.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nTower Bridge is often mistaken for London Bridge,[38] the next bridge upstream. A popular urban legend is that in 1968, Robert P. McCulloch, the purchaser of the old London Bridge that was later shipped to Lake Havasu City in Arizona, believed that he was in fact buying Tower Bridge. This was denied by McCulloch himself and has been debunked by Ivan Luckin, the vendor of the bridge.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nA partial replica of Tower Bridge has been built in the city of Suzhou in China. The replica differs from the original in having no lifting mechanism and having four separate towers.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 August 1912 Francis McClean flew between the bascules and the high-level walkways in his Short Brothers S.33 floatplane.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1952, the bridge opened while a number 78 double-decker bus was crossing from the south bank. At that time, the gateman would ring a warning bell and close the gates when the bridge was clear before the watchman ordered the raising of the bridge. The process failed while a relief watchman was on duty. The bus was near the edge of the south bascule when it started to rise; driver Albert Gunter made a split-second decision to accelerate, clearing a 3-foot (0.91?m) gap to drop 6 feet (1.8?m) onto the north bascule, which had not yet started to rise. There were no serious injuries.[43][44] Gunter was given S10 (equivalent to S260 in 2016[8]) by the City Corporation to honour his act of bravery.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hawker Hunter Tower Bridge incident occurred on 5 April 1968 when a Royal Air Force Hawker Hunter FGA.9 jet fighter from No. 1 Squadron, flown by Flt Lt Alan Pollock, flew through Tower Bridge. Unimpressed that senior staff were not going to celebrate the RAF's 50th birthday with a fly-past, Pollock decided to do something himself. Without authorisation, Pollock flew the Hunter at low altitude down the Thames, past the Houses of Parliament, and continued on toward Tower Bridge. He flew the Hunter beneath the bridge's walkway, remarking afterwards that it was an afterthought when he saw the bridge looming ahead of him. Pollock was placed under arrest upon landing, and discharged from the RAF on medical grounds without the chance to defend himself at a court martial.[46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 1973, a single-engined Beagle Pup was twice flown under the pedestrian walkway of Tower Bridge by 29-year-old stockbroker's clerk Paul Martin. Martin was on bail following accusations of stockmarket fraud. He then \\"buzzed\\" buildings in The City, before flying north towards the Lake District where he died when his aircraft crashed some two hours later.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1997,[49] the motorcade of United States President Bill Clinton was divided by the opening of the bridge. The Thames sailing barge Gladys, on her way to a gathering at St Katharine Docks, arrived on schedule and the bridge was opened for her. Returning from a Thames-side lunch at Le Pont de la Tour restaurant with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, President Clinton was less punctual and arrived just as the bridge was rising. The bridge opening split the motorcade in two, much to the consternation of security staff. A spokesman for Tower Bridge is quoted as saying: \\"We tried to contact the American Embassy, but they wouldn't answer the phone.\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 August 1999, Jef Smith, a Freeman of the City of London, drove a flock of two sheep across the bridge. He was exercising a claimed ancient permission, granted as a right to Freemen, to make a point about the powers of older citizens and the way in which their rights were being eroded.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore dawn on 31 October 2003, David Crick, a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner, climbed a 100-foot (30?m)  tower crane near Tower Bridge at the start of a six-day protest dressed as Spider-Man.[52] Fearing for his safety, and that of motorists should he fall, police cordoned off the area, closing the bridge and surrounding roads and causing widespread traffic congestion across the City and east London. The Metropolitan Police were later criticised for maintaining the closure for five days when this was not strictly necessary in the eyes of some citizens.[53][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 May 2009, six people were trapped and injured after a lift fell 10 feet (3?m) inside the north tower.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nCitations\\r\\n\\r\\nSources","input":"When was the tower bridge built in london?"},{"output":"gasoline-electric","context":"The Ford Fusion Hybrid is a gasoline-electric hybrid powered version of the mid-sized Ford Fusion sedan manufactured and marketed by Ford, now in its second generation. A plug-in hybrid version, the Ford Fusion Energi, was released in the U.S. in February 2013.[1][2]\\r\\nThe first generation was launched to the U.S. market in March 2009 for model year 2010, together with its badge-engineered variants, the Mercury Milan Hybrid and the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid.[3] The second generation was launched under the Ford and Lincoln brands for model year 2013, went on sale in the U.S. in October 2012.[4]\\r\\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rated the 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid at 39?mpg?US (6.0?L/100?km; 47?mpg?imp) combined city/highway. The second generation hybrid improved the fuel economy rating to 42?mpg?US (5.6?L/100?km; 50?mpg?imp) for combined city/highway driving.[5] The EPA rated the Energi's combined city/highway fuel economy in all-electric mode at 88 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPG-e) (2.7 L gasoline equivalent/100?km; 106 mpg-imp).[6] In hybrid operation (charge-sustaining mode), the Energi has a combined fuel economy of 38?mpg?US (6.2?L/100?km; 46?mpg?imp).[6]\\r\\nThe Fusion Hybrid has won the 2010 North American Car of the Year Award,[7] and the entire 2013 Ford Fusion line-up, including the Fusion hybrid and plug-in variants, won the 2013 Green Car of the Year.[8] As of December 2016[update], over 285,000 units of the Fusion hybrid family have been sold in the United States since 2009, including the plug-in hybrid variant.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] As of December 2016[update], sales of the Fusion Energi totaled 43,327 units delivered in its main market, the U.S.[13][14][15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hybrid electric version of the Fusion was announced at the 2005 North American International Auto Show, along with the public introduction of the original 2006 Fusion. At that time Ford announced that the hybrid version was scheduled to be introduced in early 2009 for the 2010 model year, for a suggested retail price of US$27,270.[17][18] The new Fusion Hybrid and Fusion Sport officially debuted at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2008.[19]\\r\\nThe Fusion Hybrid is manufactured at Ford's Hermosillo Stamping & Assembly plant, located in Sonora, Mexico.[20] Ford set a modest sales target of about 25,000 vehicles a year for the Fusion Hybrid and the similar Mercury Milan.[21]\\r\\nThe Fusion Hybrid was made available for press testing in December 2008 and launched to the U.S. market in March 2009. During the same month two other new hybrid models also came on sale, the Honda Insight and the Mercury Milan.[3] During the few days that were available to the public, Ford's new Fusion and Milan hybrids sold a combined 451 units, representing 3.0% of all Fusion and Milan models sold in March 2009.[3]\\r\\nThe Fusion is the first new hybrid vehicle the Ford brand offered in five years, and is the second hybrid vehicle after the Ford Escape Hybrid. The Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids join the Saturn Vue Green Line Hybrid for Mexican-built hybrid vehicles.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid, launched in the U.S. market in September 2010, shares the hybrid powertrain from the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids, and delivers an estimated fuel economy of 41?mpg?US (5.7?L/100?km; 49?mpg?imp). The MKZ Hybrid offers several improvements of Ford's Smart Gauge with EcoGuide, first introduced in the 2010 Fusion Hybrid.[22][23]\\r\\nThe Fusion Hybrid is a \\"full\\" hybrid because both propulsion sources, an electric motor powered by a Sanyo supplied[24] 275 V nickel-metal hydride battery, and a 2.5L Atkinson cycle I4 156?hp 136?ft.lbs.[citation needed] gasoline engine with intake variable cam timing(iVCT), have substantial power ratings and either can be used alone to propel the vehicle.[20][25] When braking or decelerating, the Fusion's hybrid system uses regenerative braking, where the electric drive motor becomes a generator, converting the vehicle's momentum back to electricity for storage in the batteries. Ford claims that nearly 94 percent energy recovery is achieved by first delivering full regenerative braking followed by friction brakes during city driving.[20] Under ideal conditions, Ford claims the Fusion Hybrid can cruise 2 miles (3.2?km) at up to 47 miles per hour (76?km/h) on battery power alone.[26]\\r\\nOnce perceived as a laggard in hybrid technology, Ford now claims nearly 500 hybrid patents that allow the Fusion Hybrid to achieve 41 MPG on the highway. According to Hybridcars.com, Ford has pointed to its talented inventors, making \\"special mention of Ming Kuang who has helped Ford since 2000 to expand its portfolio of hybrid patents from just 10 patents when he began to 461 today.\\" Quoted in Autotrader.com, the veteran engineer says \\"it's about helping make the world my children live in-and the world my children's children will live in-a better place.\\"\\r\\nThe Ford Fusion line-up was included in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety 2010 \\"Top Safety Pick's\\" rating for the mid-size category.[27][28] As of June 2010, Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrids are the only two mid-size hybrid vehicles in the list.[29] Due to the fact that Ford recently modified and strengthened the roof structure of the Flex, Fusion, and MKT vehicles, these 2010 ratings apply only to Lincoln MKZs, Mercury Milan and Fusions built after April 2010.[27]\\r\\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has rated the fuel economy for the 2010 Fusion Hybrid at 41 miles per US gallon (5.7?L/100?km; 49?mpg?imp) city, 36 miles per US gallon (6.5?L/100?km; 43?mpg?imp) highway.[30] The following table compares fuel economy, carbon footprint, and petroleum consumption between the hybrid version and other drivetrains of the Fusion family as estimated by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy:\\r\\nThe Ford Fusion Hybrid EPA's fuel economy rating is better than the 2011 Toyota Camry Hybrid (32?miles per gallon city, 33 highway), the Nissan Altima Hybrid (35?miles per gallon city, 33 highway), and the Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid (26?miles per gallon city, 34 highway), considered its main competitors in the mid-size sedan segment. The newer 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid LE model (43?miles per gallon city, 39 highway) now has an advantage over the 2012 Ford Fusion (41?miles per gallon city, 39 highway) by a slight margin in the city.\\r\\nIn 2009, Edmunds tested a Fusion Hybrid over two days of mixed city and highway driving against other hybrids or fuel efficient cars like the Toyota Prius, the Honda Insight, the Volkswagen Jetta TDI automatic and the MINI Cooper with manual transmission.[40] The results are summarized in the following table:\\r\\nMotor Trend found that their Fusion Hybrid delivered only 33.5?mpg?US (7.0?L/100?km; 40.2?mpg?imp) in 500 miles (800?km) of mixed driving, 5 mpg off the EPA combined rating. Over another 160 miles (260?km) of testing against a Toyota Camry Hybrid, the same car only achieved 31.8?mpg?US (7.4?L/100?km; 38.2?mpg?imp), while the Camry Hybrid delivered 32.7?mpg?US (7.2?L/100?km; 39.3?mpg?imp). \\"If our early numbers hold up, the Fusion Hybrid would be a rare instance of the EPA relapsing into the world of mileage make-believe.\\" However, they noted that when driven very conservatively, the EPA numbers could be achieved. \\"In typical driving, you might as well throw the Fusion's EPA numbers out the window. But if you decide to really work at it, they're possible.\\"[41] Car and Driver also tested a Fusion Hybrid and achieved no more than 34?mpg?US (6.9?L/100?km; 41?mpg?imp) over 300 miles (480?km) of driving, which was greater than the Camry Hybrid (31 miles per US gallon (7.6?L/100?km; 37?mpg?imp)) or Nissan Altima Hybrid (32 miles per US gallon (7.4?L/100?km; 38?mpg?imp)) though not by the margin indicated by the EPA ratings.[42]\\r\\nAccording to Ford, the vehicle was built to have a fuel efficiency of 41 mpg in the city and 36 mpg on the highway by EPA standards.[43] On December 2008, Autoblog Green staff reported they had obtained in-city mileage of 43.1 mpg on the streets of Los Angeles.[44] In addition, a Los Angeles Times reporter informed in December 2008 that he had obtained 52 mpg in mixed city-highway driving with little difficulty.[45]\\r\\nOn a single-tank publicity stunt conducted on April 2009, a Fusion Hybrid managed 81.5 miles per US gallon (2.89?L/100?km; 97.9?mpg?imp) on a 1,445.7?mile trip.[46][47]\\r\\nEdmunds' InsideLine received a 2010 Fusion Hybrid as a long-term test car. Over 11,000 miles (18,000?km) of driving, their vehicle had only averaged 31.3?mpg?US (7.5?L/100?km; 37.6?mpg?imp), with a best tank of 37.7?mpg?US (6.24?L/100?km; 45.3?mpg?imp) and a worst tank of 24.4?mpg?US (9.6?L/100?km; 29.3?mpg?imp).[48]\\r\\nAccording to Edmunds.com, the price premium paid for the Fusion Hybrid takes 5 years to recover in fuel savings as compared to its non-hybrid sibling, and is one of the quickest payback periods among top selling hybrids as of February 2012. Edmunds compared the hybrid version priced at US$27,678 with a comparably-equipped gasoline-powered Fusion priced at US$24,493 and found that the payback period is 6 years for gasoline at US$3 per gallon, 4 years at US$4 per gallon, and drops to 3 years with gasoline prices at US$5 per gallon. These estimates assume an average of 15,000?mi (24,000?km) annual driving and vehicle prices correspond to Edmunds.com's true market value estimates.[49] For the same two vehicles, the U.S. EPA estimates the Fusion Hybrid annual fuel cost at US$1,431 while the gasoline-powered Fusion has an annual fuel cost of US$2,320. EPA estimates are based on 45% highway and 55% city driving, over 15,000 annual miles, and gasoline price of US$3.72 per gallon, the national average as of February 2012.[50] The Lincoln MKZ Hybrid has no price premium.[49]\\r\\nThe Fusion Hybrid comes with a SmartGauge with EcoGuide which features two 4.3-inch high-resolution, full-color LCD screens on either side of the vehicles analog speedometer. The objective of these panel display is to coach drivers on how to optimize the performance of their hybrid by keeping track of their eco driving improvements.[51][52][53]\\r\\nThese screens can be configured to show different levels of driver information, including fuel and battery power levels, and average and instant fuel economy. When set in tutorial mode, the instrument panel in the right side grows leaves and vines on-screen to reward fuel-efficient driving. The more leaves and vines that appear, the more efficient the driving behavior is and the more fuel is being saved. Long-term fuel efficiency can be also be displayed as a traditional chart. The left side display shows when the car is in pure-electric mode, and shows the state of battery charge.[51][52][53]\\r\\nThe 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid, launched in September 2010, offers an improvement of Ford's SmartGauge with EcoGuide introduced with the 2010 Fusion and Milan hybrids.[22][23]\\r\\nIn 2012, with the introduction of the second generation Fusion, Ford redesigned its SmartGauge with EcoGuide system giving it a newer look and new customizable MyView features. One of the new features, Brake Coach, gives instant feedback on the drivers braking habits and gives them advice to maximize the efficiency of the regenerative braking system. Other new features included, Inform, Enlighten, Engage, and Empower.\\r\\nThe Fusion Hybrid qualified for a maximum hybrid tax credit of US$3,400 if purchased by March 31, 2009. The credit dropped to US$1,700 if purchased by September 30, 2009, to US$850 if purchased from October 2009 and March 31, 2010, and phased out on April 1, 2010.[54]\\r\\nThe Brazilian version of the Fusion Hybrid was unveiled at the 2010 S?o Paulo International Auto Show. Sales began in November 2010 at a price of R$133,900 (US$78,500). The Fusion Hybrid was the first full hybrid car sold in Brazil.[55] Imported from Mexico, the Fusion Hybrid engine performance and fuel system durability was tested with the Brazilian mandatory E20 to E25 ethanol blends.[56]\\r\\nA complete redesign of the Ford Fusion lineup for the model year 2013 was unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. The new lineup includes three optional engines for the conventional four-cylinder-only gasoline model, a next-generation hybrid version, and a plug-in hybrid version, the Ford Fusion Energi. The Ford Fusion became the first production sedan to offer these three powertrain options.[58] In April 2012 Ford announced that an auto start-stop system will be available for the 1.6-liter EcoBoost engine non-hybrid version, at a price of US$295. The expected fuel economy was a combined 37?mpg?US (6.4?L/100?km; 44?mpg?imp).[59] Sales of the gasoline-powered and hybrid version began in the U.S. in October 2012.[4]\\r\\nSales in Europe and Asia, under the Ford Mondeo name, were planned to start in 2013.[60][61] Ford began taking orders of the Mondeo Hybrid in Germany in August 2014.[62] Production of the Mondeo Hybrid began at Fords Valencia, Spain, plant in November 2014.[63]\\r\\nThe nickel-metal hydride batteries used in the hybrid first generation were replaced with lithium-ion batteries.[61] The 2013 model year Fusion Hybrid is more fuel efficient than its predecessor, with a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rating of 42?mpg?US (5.6?L/100?km; 50?mpg?imp) combined, 44?mpg?US (5.3?L/100?km; 53?mpg?imp) in city and 41?mpg?US (5.7?L/100?km; 49?mpg?imp) in highway driving.[5] Initially, the second generation Fusion Hybrid was rated 47?mpg?US (5.0?L/100?km; 56?mpg?imp) with the same rating for combined/city/highway cycles. However, in June 2014 Ford announced that it was downgrading the EPA fuel economy ratings on six of its 2013 and 2014 model year vehicles, including all its C-Max, Fusion and MKZ full hybrids and its two plug-in Energi models. The ratings were lowered after an error was discovered in the company's internal testing data. Ford is making a goodwill payments to around 200,000 customers affected by its mistake.[64][65] After the ratings were lowered the 2013/14 Fusion Hybrid still slightly outperforms the 2012/2014 Toyota Camry Hybrid LE by 1 mpg-US city and 2 mpg-US highway, and the Camry XLE by 4 mpg-US city and 3 mpg-US highway.[66]\\r\\nThe second generation hybrid has a powertrain with a 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle inline-four ÿ downsized from the 2.5-liter unit used in the first generation Fusion Hybrid. Total output is estimated at 185?hp (138?kW) and 130?ft{lb (180?N{m), running to the front wheels via an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission.[67] The lithium-ion battery pack saves weight and generates more power than previous NiMH batteries, and allows the second generation Fusion Hybrid to raise its maximum speed under electric-only power from 47 to 62?mph (76 to 100?km/h).[60]\\r\\nThe 2013 Fusion Hybrid includes driver assistance and technologies based on sensors, cameras and radar that enable the car to see and respond. Fusion can help drivers maintain proper lane position (Lane Keeping System); adjust vehicle speed to changing traffic conditions through adaptive cruise control; active park assist to help identify suitable parking spaces and help park; and Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) with cross-traffic alert, which consists of sensors in both rear quarter-panels that are able to detect traffic in a drivers blind spot, providing both audible and visual warnings if traffic unseen by the driver is detected. BLIS technology enables cross-traffic alert, even aiding drivers backing out of parking space where visibility is obstructed.[60][68]\\r\\nDuring the 2012 North American International Auto Show Ford also unveiled the Lincoln MKZ concept model.[69] Ford offers a hybrid option of the redesigned 2013 Lincoln MKZ, and like the previous MKZ generation, the MKZ Hybrid is available for the same price as the non-hybrid model.[70][71]\\r\\nThe EPA rated initially the 2013 MKZ Hybrid at 45?mpg?US (5.2?L/100?km; 54?mpg?imp) with the same rating for combined/city/highway cycles.[64] After the ratings of six Ford models were downgraded in June 2014, the MKZ was the model with the largest fuel economy reduction, 7 mpg-US in city/highway combined.[65] The revised EPA ratings of 2013/14 MKZ Hybrid are 38?mpg?US (6.2?L/100?km; 46?mpg?imp) combined, 38?mpg?US (6.2?L/100?km; 46?mpg?imp) in city and 37?mpg?US (6.4?L/100?km; 44?mpg?imp) in highway driving. Despite sharing the same powertrain, the 2013/14 MKZ Hybrid is rated 4 mpg-US combined less than its sibling the second generation Ford Fusion Hybrid, and 6 mpg-US less in city driving.[72]\\r\\nThe Mondeo Hybrid shares the same powertrain of the Fusion Hybrid combining a 2.0-liter gasoline engine with an electric motor and 1.4 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery. Under the New European Driving Cycle the Mondeo is rated at 67.3?mpg?imp (4.20?L/100?km; 56.0?mpg?US) in combined driving, and 100.9?mpg?imp (2.80?L/100?km; 84.0?mpg?US) for urban driving, with CO2 emissions of 99 g/km. Ford set a pricing for the Mondeo Hybrid that is competitive with Mondeo diesel powertrain variants.[63] Retail deliveries are scheduled to begin in the UK in December 2014 at a pricing starting at GBS24,995.[63]\\r\\nIn December 2012, Motor Trend reported that Consumer Reports and Green Car Reports have found that the 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid and 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid, which share the same powertrain, do not deliver their triple 47?mpg?US (5.0?L/100?km; 56?mpg?imp) EPA ratings in real-world use.[73][74][75] After running both vehicles through Consumer Reports real-world tests, the magazine found that 2013 Fusion hybrid achieved a combined fuel economy average of 39?mpg?US (6.0?L/100?km; 47?mpg?imp), with 35 and 41?mpg?US (6.7 and 5.7?L/100?km; 42 and 49?mpg?imp) for city and highway.[74] Consumer Reports concluded that the overall fuel economy for the Fusion Hybrid is off by 8 mpg, representing a deviation of about 20%. The consumer magazine said that their overall fuel economy results are usually close to the EPA's combined-mpg estimate, and among current models tested, more than 80% fall within 2 mpg margin. The largest discrepancy the magazine has previously found was 7 and 6 mpg for the Toyota Prius c and the Prius hatchback, respectively.[74][76]\\r\\nA few days later the Environmental Protection Agency said it will review claims that two new Ford hybrid vehicles are not delivering the advertised 47 mpg. Linc Wehrly, Director of Light-duty Vehicle Center Compliance Division at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan commented that hybrids have far more variability in miles per gallon than a conventional vehicle. Most vehicles' real-world gasoline mileage is less than the EPA sticker number, and can often be 20% less than the sticker number depending on speed, temperature and other factors. The EPA explained that with hybrids the gap is much wider, as high as a 30% drop.[77] Ford responded in a statement, saying that, \\"Early C-MAX Hybrid and Fusion Hybrid customers praise the vehicles and report a range of fuel economy figures, including some reports above 47 mpg. This reinforces the fact that driving styles, driving conditions, and other factors can cause mileage to vary.\\"[76][77] A Ford spokesman also said they followed EPA's test guidelines and the company is standing by the ratings as determined by the current testing protocols. Nevertheless, they are working closely with the agency to determine if any changes are needed for the industry relative to hybrid vehicle testing.[78][79]\\r\\nIn July 2013, Ford issued a voluntary software update for the 2013 model year Fusion, C-Max and MKZ Hybrid, that attempts to improve on the lower-than-expected MPG claims.[80] Some of the changes include:\\r\\nIn August 2013, and due to the criticism and after several lawsuits about the worse-than-expected fuel economy, Ford voluntarily lowered all three EPA ratings of the C-Max Hybrid and will pay about a rebate to some 32,000 C-Max owners. The revised fuel economy ratings for combined was lowered from to 47 to 45?mpg?US (5.0 to 5.2?L/100?km; 56 to 54?mpg?imp). Ford has no plans to change the fuel economy ratings on the 2013 Fusion hybrid, because the company used the Fusion hybrid test to generate the fuel economy label for the C-Max Hybrid following EPA's rules.[81]\\r\\nThe Fusion Energi is a plug-in hybrid unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show,[61] and retail sales in the U.S. began in February 2013.[2] Initially it was priced at US$39,495, and in January 2014 the starting price was reduced to US$35,525.[85][86] Due to the capacity of its battery pack, the Energi qualifies for a federal tax credit up to US$3,750 and any applicable state and local incentives.[85] Energi models purchased in or after 2010 are eligible for a $4,007 tax credit, which is based on the capacity of the battery used to fuel the vehicle.[87] The 2013 Fusion Energi is eligible for access to Californias high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV) with a solo driver, and also for a US$1,500 California state tax rebate.[88]\\r\\nA refreshed 2017 Fusion Energi is scheduled to be released by mid-2016. In addition to a new fascia and other technological upgrades, the 2017 model year has more efficient electric motors, allowing the refreshed 2017 model year Fusion Energi to increase its all-electric range and to improve its EPA fuel economy ratings.[83][89] As of December 2016[update], over 43,700 units have been sold in North America, with 43,327 units delivered in the U.S.[13][14][15][16] and about 386 units in Canada.[90]\\r\\nThe Fusion Energi uses the same non-turbo 2-liter 4-cylinder engine supplements as the 2013 Fusion Hybrid to assist the electric motor.[61] The Energi has a 7.6 kWh lithium-ion battery that powers the 88?kW (118?hp) electric motor.[82] The plug-in hybrid delivers total horsepower of 195 (145?kW) with a fully charged battery and has an electric-only top speed of 85?mph (137?km/h), 23?mph (37?km/h) more than the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid.\\r\\nThe Fusion Energi, model years 2013 through 2016, has an official EPA all-electric range of 20?mi (32?km) and the total range with a full tank of gasoline and a fully charged battery is 550?mi (890?km) according to the EPA.[91] The all-electric range of the refreshed 2017 model year Fusion Energi increases to 22?mi (35?km), and thanks to a better fuel economy, the total range increases to 610?mi (980?km).[83][84]\\r\\nThe EPA's 2015 edition of the \\"Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends\\" presents utility factors for plug-in hybrids to represent the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver, in electric only or blended modes. Both the Fusion and C-Max Energi models have a utility factor in EV mode of 45%, compared with 83% for the BMW i3 REx, 66/65% for the Chevrolet Volt/Cadillac ELR, 43% for the McLaren P1, 37% for the BMW i8, and 29% for the Toyota Prius PHV.[92]\\r\\nIn May 2016, Ford reported, based on data collected from more than 610 million miles (976 million km) logged by its electrified vehicles through its telematics system, that drivers of these vehicles run an average of 13,500?mi (21,700?km) annually on their vehicles, with about half of those miles operating in all-electric mode. A break down of these figures show an average daily commute of 42?mi (68?km) for Ford Energi plug-in hybrid drivers. Ford notes that with the enhanced electric range of the 2017 model year model, the average Fusion Energi commuter could go the entire day using no gasoline, if the car is fully charged both, before leaving for work and before leaving for home. According to Ford data, currently most customers are likely charging their vehicles only at home.[93]\\r\\nInitially, the EPA rated the Energi's combined city/highway fuel economy in all-electric mode at 100 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPG-e) (2.4 L gasoline equivalent/100?km).[94] Later, due to complaints from owners not achieving the sticker fuel economy, and following a technical review, the official EPA rating in EV mode was downgraded to 88 MPG-e (2.7?L/100?km).[6] The Fusion Energi combined fuel economy equivalent is the same as the 2013 Ford C-Max Energi.[95] In a similar way, in hybrid operation, initially the Energi had an EPA combined city/highway fuel economy of 43?mpg?US (5.5?L/100?km; 52?mpg?imp).[96] It was later downgraded by the EPA to 38?mpg?US (6.2?L/100?km; 46?mpg?imp).[6] EPA's rating for combined EV/hybrid operation is 51?MPG-e (4.6 L gasoline equivalent/100?km), which allowed the Fusion Energi to rank at the time in sixth place, together with the C-Max Energi, among the top ten EPA-Rated Fuel Sippers since 1984.[97]\\r\\nThe refreshed 2017 model year Fusion Energi has an increased EPA rated fuel economy in all-electric mode to 97 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPG-e) (2.4?L/100?km) for combined city/highway driving, with an energy consumption of 35?kWh/100?mi. The EPA rating in hybrid operation rose to 42?mpg?US (5.6?L/100?km; 50?mpg?imp).[83][84]\\r\\nA police pursuit version achieves 38 mpg, whereas the regular Interceptor gets 18 mpg.[98]\\r\\nDuring 2009, the Fusion Hybrid sold in the U.S. market a total of 15,554 units and the Milan Hybrid 1,486 units, as reported by the manufacturers. Although the Fusion Hybrid helped Ford bypass Honda to become the second biggest seller of hybrids in the US market in the month of December 2009, for the whole year of 2009, Honda sold more hybrid vehicles (35,691 units) than Ford (33,520 units) and the 2010 Honda Insight also outsold the Fusion Hybrid, with 20,572 units.[9]\\r\\nFor the year 2010, U.S. sales of Ford Fusion Hybrid reached of 20,816 units, helping the model to become the third best selling hybrid in 2010 after the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight.[10] The Milan Hybrid sold 1,416 units in 2010 and its production was discontinued as part of Ford's decision to phase out the entire Mercury brand.[10][108] Purchases by the US Government at the behest of the Obama administration accounted for almost a third of the Ford Fusion Hybrids produced between 2009 and late 2010.[109]\\r\\nFord reported that Fusion sales reached 151,004 units through July 2011, of which, 7,780 were the hybrid version, representing a 5.1% market share of all Fusion sales.[110][111] During year 2011, the Fusion Hybrid sold 11,286 units and the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid sold 5,739 units, ranking sixth and tenth correspondingly, in hybrid sales for calendar year 2011.[11] Fusion hybrid sales in 2012 increased 24.9% over 2011 sales,[12] and hybrid models represented a 5.8% share of the 241,263 Fusion sold in 2012.[12][112]\\r\\nThe introduction of the redesigned 2013 model year Fusion, with a more fuel efficient second generation powertrain, resulted in increased sales of the hybrid version, and by August 2013, sales were up 275.2% over the same period in 2012. The Fusion Energi achieved record sales in August 2013. Also during this month, the Fusion Hybrid recorded its best sales month ever in Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Seattle, and its second best-selling month in Los Angeles, another key hybrid market. This rapid increase in sales contributed to Ford achieving its best August electric drive vehicle sales ever.[113][114] The Fusion Hybrid sales increased 164.3% from 2012 and ended 2013 as the fourth top selling hybrid in the U.S. after the Prius liftback, the Prius c and the Toyota Camry Hybrid.[13]\\r\\nThe redesigned 2013 model year Lincoln MKZ hybrid also experienced somewhat stronger sales during 2013. In July 2013, Ford announced that for the 2014 model year MKZ hybrid it would increase the share of production allocated to the hybrid version, from 20% for the 2013 model year to 40% of the 2014 model year. The Lincoln MKZ Hybrid is popular among consumers in part because it has the same base price as the non-hybrid MKZ.[115]\\r\\nSales of hybrid electric cars in the U.S. in 2014 declined 8.8% from 2013. Following the trend of the hybrid market, Fusion Hybrid sales were down 5.0% from 2013, and continued to rank as the fourth top selling hybrid in the U.S. Sales of Lincoln MKZ Hybrid continued its growth trend with sales up 34.3% from a year earlier.[14] The American plug-in hybrid market in 2014 was up 13.1% from 2013, while combined sales of both of Fords Energi models (Fusion and C-Max) increased by 50.9% despite the reduction of their fuel economy ratings. Sales of the Fusion Energi were up 89.7% from 2013 while C-Mx Energi sales were up only by 17.9%.[14]\\r\\nThe American hybrid electric segment continued to decline in 2015, down 15% from 2014. Following the general U.S. trend, Fusion Hybrid sales were down 30.3% from 2014, and the Fusion continued to rank as the fourth top selling hybrid in the U.S. Sales of Lincoln MKZ Hybrid fell 16.2% from a year earlier. The American plug-in hybrid market in 2015 was up 5.8% from 2014, however, sales of the Fusion Energi were down 15.6% from 2014, and C-Mx Energi sales were down by 10.0%. The Fusion Energi ranked as the second top selling plug-in hybrid in the country after the Chevrolet Volt, up from third place in 2014, and passing the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid.[15]\\r\\nSince 2009 a total of 285,093 units of the Fusion hybrid family, including the Energi plug-in hybrid, have been sold in the United States through December 2016.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] U.S. sales by year for each model and the share of hybrids out of total model sales are shown in the following table:","input":"What type of hybrid is the ford fusion?"},{"output":"petroleum","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard & Poor's:[13]SD (domestic)SD (foreign)Outlook: negative\\r\\n\\r\\nMoody's:[14]COutlook: stable\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economy of Venezuela is largely based on the petroleum sector and manufacturing.[17] In 2014, total trade amounted to 48.1% of the country's GDP. Exports accounted for 16.7% of GDP and petroleum products accounted for about 95% of those exports.[18] Venezuela is the sixth largest member of OPEC by oil production. Since the 1920s, Venezuela has been a rentier state, offering oil as its main export.[19] From the 1950s to the early 1980s, the Venezuelan economy experienced a steady growth that attracted many immigrants, with the nation enjoying the highest standard of living in Latin America. During the collapse of oil prices in the 1980s, the economy contracted the monetary sign, commenced a progressive devaluation and inflation skyrocketed to reach peaks of 84% in 1989 and 99% in 1996, three years prior to Hugo Chvez taking office. The nation, however, has experienced hyperinflation since 2015 far exceeding the oil price collapse of the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nVenezuela manufactures and exports heavy industry products such as steel, aluminum and cement. Production is concentrated around Ciudad Guayana, near the Guri Dam, one of the largest dams in the world and the provider of about three-quarters of Venezuela's electricity. Other notable manufacturing includes electronics and automobiles as well as beverages and foodstuffs. Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 4.4% of GDP, 7.3% of the labor force and at least one-fourth of Venezuela's land area.[2] Venezuela exports rice, corn, fish, tropical fruit, coffee, pork and beef. The country is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of strained relations between the two countries, the United States has been Venezuela's most important trading partner. American exports to Venezuela have included machinery, agricultural products, medical instruments and cars. Venezuela is one of the top four suppliers of foreign oil to the United States. About 500 American companies are represented in Venezuela.[17] According to Central Bank of Venezuela, between 1998 and 2008 the government received around 325 billion USD through oil production and exports in general.[17] According to the International Energy Agency (as of August 2015), the production of 2.4 million barrels per day supplied 500,000 barrels to the United States.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Bolivarian Revolution half-dismantled its PDVSA oil giant corporation in 2002 by firing most of its 20,000-strong dissident professional human capital and imposed stringent currency controls in 2003 in an attempt to prevent capital flight,[20] there has been a steady decline in oil production and exports and a series of stern currency devaluations, disrupting the economy.[21] Further yet, price controls, expropriation of numerous farmlands and various industries, among other disputable government policies including a near-total freeze on any access to foreign currency at reasonable \\"official\\" exchange rates, have resulted in severe shortages in Venezuela and steep price rises of all common goods, including food, water, household products, spare parts, tools and medical supplies; forcing many manufacturers to either cut production or close down, with many ultimately abandoning the country as has been the case with several technological firms and most automobile makers.[22][23] In 2015, Venezuela had over 100% inflationthe highest in the world and the highest in the country's history at that time.[24] According to independent sources, the rate increased to 4,000% in 2017[25][26][27][28] with Venezuela spiraling into hyperinflation[29] while the population poverty rate was between 76%[30] and 87%.[7][25] On 14 November 2017, credit rating agencies declared that Venezuela was in default with its debt payments, with Standard & Poor's categorizing Venezuela as being in \\"selective default\\".[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen oil was discovered during Maracaibo strike in 1922, Venezuela's dictator Juan Vicente G܇mez allowed American oil companies to write Venezuela's petroleum law.[33] However, oil history was made in 1943 when Standard Oil of New Jersey accepted a new agreement in Venezuela based on the 50ÿ50 principle, \\"a landmark event\\".[34] Terms even more favorable to Venezuela were negotiated in 1945 after a coup brought to power a left-leaning government that included Juan Pablo Prez Alfonso.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 1950s to the early 1980s, the Venezuelan economy, which was buoyed by high oil prices, was one of the strongest and most prosperous in South America. The continuous growth during that period attracted many immigrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1958, a new government, again included Prez Alfonso, devised a plan for the international oil cartel that would become OPEC.[35] In 1973, Venezuela voted to nationalize its oil industry outright, effective 1 January 1976, with Petr܇leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) presiding over a number of holding companies. In subsequent years, Venezuela built a vast refining and marketing system in the United States and Europe.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Prez Jimenez' dictatorship from 1952 to 1958, Venezuela enjoyed remarkably high GDP growth, so that in the late 1950s Venezuela's real GDP per capita almost reached that of West Germany. In 1950, Venezuela was the world's 4th largest wealthiest nation per capita.[37] However, Romulo Betancourt (President from 1959 to 1964) inherited from 1958ÿ1959 onward an enormous internal and external debt caused by rampant public spending during the dictatorship. Nevertheless, he managed to balance Venezuela's public budget and initiate an unsuccessful agrarian reform.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nBuoyed by a strong oil sector in the 1960s and 1970s, Venezuela's governments were able to maintain social harmony by spending fairly large amounts on public programs including health care, education, transport and food subsidies. Literacy and welfare programs benefited tremendously from these conditions.[39] Because of the oil wealth, Venezuelan workers \\"enjoyed the highest wages in Latin America\\".[40] This situation was reversed when oil prices collapsed during the 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen world oil prices collapsed in the 1980s, the economy contracted and inflation levels (consumer price inflation) rose, remaining between 6 and 12% from 1982 to 1986.[41][42] The inflation rate peaked in 1989 at 84%,[42] the year the capital city of Caracas suffered from rioting during the Caracazo following the cut of government spending and the opening of markets by President Carlos Andrs Prez.[43] After Prez initiated such liberal economic policies and made Venezuelan markets more free, Venezuela's GDP went from a -8.3% decline in 1989 to growing 4.4% in 1990 and 9.2% in 1991, though wages remained low and unemployment was high among Venezuelans.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome state that neoliberalism was the cause of Venezuelan economic difficulties, though overreliance on oil prices and a fractured political system without parties agreeing on policies caused many of the problems.[44] By the mid-1990s, Venezuela under President Rafael Caldera saw annual inflation rates of 50ÿ60% from 1993 to 1997 with an exceptional peak in 1996 at 100%.[42] The number of people living in poverty rose from 36% in 1984 to 66% in 1995,[45] with the country suffering a severe banking crisis (Venezuelan banking crisis of 1994). In 1998, the economic crisis had grown even worse. Per capita GDP was at the same level as 1963 (after adjusting 1963 dollar to 1998 value), down a third from its 1978 peak; and the purchasing power of the average salary was a third of its 1978 level.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nHugo Chvez was elected President in December 1998 and took office in February 1999. In 2000, oil prices soared, offering Chvez funds not seen since Venezuela's economic collapse in the 1980s.[41] Chvez then used economic policies that were more social democratic than those of his predecessors, using populist approaches with oil funds that made Venezuela's economy dependent on high oil prices.[41] Chvez also played a leading role within OPEC to reinvigorate the organization and obtain members' adherence to lower quotas designed to drive up the oil price. Al Rodrguez Araque, the Venezuelan oil minister, gave an announcement in 1999 that his country would respect OPEC production quotas, which marked \\"a historic turnaround from the nation's traditional pro-US oil policy\\".[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first four years of the Chvez presidency, the economy grew at first (1999ÿ2001), then contracted from 2001ÿ2003 to GDP levels similar to 1997. At first, the economic decline was due to low oil prices, but it was fueled by the turmoil of the 2002 coup attempt and the 2002ÿ2003 business strike. Other factors of the decline were an exodus of capital from the country and a reluctance of foreign investors. GDP was 50.0 trillion bolivares in 1998. At the bottom of the recession in 2003, it was 42.4 trillion bolivares (in constant 1998 bolivares).[48] However, GDP rebounded 50.1 trillion bolivares with a calmer political situation in 2004 and rose to 66.1 trillion bolivares in 2007 (both in constant 1998 bolivares).[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government sought international assistance to finance reconstruction after massive flooding and landslides in December 1999 caused an estimated US$15 billion to $20 billion in damage.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hardest hit sectors in the worst recession years (2002ÿ2003) were construction (?55.9%), petroleum (?26.5%), commerce (?23.6%) and manufacturing (?22.5%). The drop in the petroleum sector was caused by adherence to the OPEC quota established in 2002 and the virtual cessation of exports during the PdVSA-led general strike of 2002ÿ2003. The non-petroleum sector of the economy contracted by 6.5% in 2002. The bolivar, which had been suffering from serious inflation and devaluation relative to international standards since the late 1980s,[50] continued to weaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inflation rate as measured by consumer price index was 35.8% in 1998, falling to a low of 12.5% in 2001 and rising to 31.1% in 2003. Historically, the highest yearly inflation was 100% in 1996. In an attempt to support the bolivar, bolster the government's declining level of international reserves and mitigate the adverse impact from the oil industry work stoppage on the financial system, the Ministry of Finance and the central bank suspended foreign exchange trading on 23 January 2003. On 6 February, the government created CADIVI, a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. The board set the US$ exchange rate at 1,596 bolivares to the dollar for purchases and 1,600 to the dollar for sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe housing market in Venezuela shrunk significantly with developers avoiding Venezuela due to the massive number of companies who have had their property expropriated by the government.[51] According to The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal, Venezuela had the weakest property rights in the world, scoring only 5.0 on a scale of 100, with expropriation without compensation being common.[52] The shortage of housing is so significant that in 2007 a group of squatters occupied Centro Financiero Confinanzas, a cancelled economic center that was supposed to symbolize Venezuela's growing economy.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Venezuelan economy shrank 5.8% in the first three months of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009[54] and had the highest inflation rate in Latin America at 30.5%.[54] President Chvez expressed optimism that Venezuela would emerge from recession[54] despite the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts showing that Venezuela would be the only country in the region to remain in recession that year.[55] The IMF qualified the economic recovery of Venezuela as \\"delayed and weak\\" in comparison with other countries of the region.[56] Following Chavez's death in early 2013, Venezuela's economy continued to fall into an even greater recession.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the misery index in 2013, Venezuela ranked as the top spot globally with the highest misery index score.[57][58] The International Finance Corporation ranked Venezuela one of the lowest countries for doing business with, ranking it 180 of 185 countries for its Doing Business 2013 report with protecting investors and taxes being its worst rankings.[59][60] In early 2013, the bolvar fuerte was devalued due to growing shortages in Venezuela.[61] The shortages included necessities such as toilet paper, milk and flour.[62] Shortages also affected healthcare in Venezuela, with the University of Caracas Medical Hospital ceasing to perform surgeries due to the lack of supplies in 2014.[63] The Bolivarian government's policies also made it difficult to import drugs and other medical supplies.[64] Due to such complications, many Venezuelans died avoidable deaths with medical professionals having to use limited resources using methods that were replaced decades ago.[65][66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, Venezuela entered an economic recession having its GDP growth decline to -3.0%.[67] Venezuela was placed at the top of the misery index for the second year in a row.[68] The Economist said Venezuela was \\"[p]robably the worlds worst-managed economy\\".[69] Citibank believed that \\"the economy has little prospect of improvement\\" and that the state of the Venezuelan economy was a \\"disaster\\".[70] The Doing Business 2014 report by the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank ranked Venezuela one score lower than the previous year, then 181 out of 185.[71] The Heritage Foundation ranked Venezuela 175th out of 178 countries in economic freedom for 2014, classifying it as a \\"repressed\\" economy according to the principles the foundation advocates.[72][73] According to Foreign Policy, Venezuela was ranked last in the world on its Base Yield Index due to low returns that investors receive when investing in Venezuela.[74] In a 2014 report titled Scariest Places on the Business Frontiers by Zurich Financial Services and reported by Bloomberg, Venezuela was ranked as the riskiest emerging market in the world.[75] Many companies such as Toyota, Ford Motor Co., General Motors Company, Air Canada, Air Europa, American Airlines, Copa Airlines, TAME, TAP Airlines and United Airlines slowed or stopped operation due to the lack of hard currency in the country,[76][77][78][79][80] with Venezuela owing such foreign companies billions of dollars.[81] Venezuela also dismantled CADIVI, a government body in charge of currency exchange. CADIVI was known for holding money from the private sector and was suspected to be corrupt.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nVenezuela again topped the misery index according to the World Bank in 2015.[83][84] The IMF predicted in October 2015 an inflation rate of 159% for the year 2015the highest rate in Venezuelan history and the highest rate in the worldand that the economy would contract by 10%.[24][85] According to leaked documents from the Central Bank of Venezuela, the country ended 2015 with an inflation rate of 270% and a shortage rate of goods over 70%.[86][87]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Nicols Maduro reorganized his economic cabinet in 2016 with the group mainly consisting of leftist Venezuelan academics.[88] According to Bank of America's investment division Merrill Lynch, Maduro's new cabinet was expected to tighten currency and price controls in the country.[88] Alejandro Werner, the head of IMF's Latin American Department, stated that 2015 figures released by the Central Bank of Venezuela were not accurate and that Venezuela's inflation for 2015 was 275%. Other forecast inflation figures by IMF and Bank of America were 720%[89][90] and 1,000% in 2016,[91][92] Analysts believed that the Venezuelan government has been manipulating economic statistics, especially since they did not report adequate data since late 2014.[91] According to economist Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University, the Central Bank of Venezuela delayed the release of statistics and lied about figures much like the Soviet Union did, with Hanke saying that a lie coefficient had to be used to observe Venezuela's economic data.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2016, media outlets said that Venezuela was suffering an economic collapse[94][95] with the IMF estimating a 500% inflation rate and 10% contraction in the GDP.[96] In December 2016, monthly inflation exceeded 50 percent for the 30th consecutive day, meaning the Venezuelan economy was officially experiencing hyperinflation, making it the 57th country to be added to the Hanke-Krus World Hyperinflation Table.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 August 2017, it was reported that new United States sanctions against Venezuela did not ban trading of the countrys existing non-government bonds, with the sanctions instead including restrictions intended to block the governments ability to fund itself.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 26 January 2018, the government ended the protected, subsidized fixed exchange rate mechanism that was highly overvalued as a result of rampant inflation.[99] The National Assembly (led by the opposition) said inflation in 2017 was over 4,000%, a level other independent economists also agreed with.[25] In February, the government launched an oil backed cryptocurrency called the petro.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nBloomberg's Cafe Con Leche Index calculated the price increase for a cup of coffee to have increased by 718% in the 12 weeks before 18 January 2018, an annualized inflation rate of 448,000%.[101] The finance commission of the National Assembly noted in July 2018 that prices were doubling every 28 days with an annualized inflation rate of 25,000%.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country was heading for a selective default in 2017.[103] In early 2018, the country was in default, meaning it could not pay its lenders.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the tenures of Hugo Chvez and his successor Nicols Maduro, many businesses abandoned Venezuela. In 1999, there were 13,000 companies in the country. By 2016, less than a third of companies remained in Venezuela, with only 4,000 companies operating in the nation.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nVenezuela is a major producer of petroleum products, which remain the keystone of the Venezuelan economy. The International Energy Agency shows how Venezuela's oil production has fallen in the last years, producing only 2,300,000 barrels (370,000?m3) daily, down from 3.5 million in 1998. However, the oil incomes will double its value in local currency with the recent currency devaluation.[106] Venezuela has large energy subsidies. In 2015, the cost of petrol was just US$0.06 per gallon, costing 23% of government revenues.[107] In February 2016, the government finally decided to raise the price, but only to 6 bolivar (about 60S at the official rate of exchange) per litre for premium and just 1 bolivar (10S) for lower-grade petrol.[108][109]\\r\\n\\r\\nA range of other natural resources, including iron ore, coal, bauxite, gold, nickel and diamonds, are in various stages of development and production. In April 2000, Venezuela's president decreed a new mining law and regulations were adopted to encourage greater private sector participation in mineral extraction. During Venezuela's economic crisis, the rate of gold excavated fell 64.1% between February 2013 and February 2014 and iron production dropped 49.8%.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nVenezuela mostly utilizes hydropower resources to supply power to the nation's industries, accounting for 57% of total consumption at the end of 2016.[111] However, persistent drought has severely reduced energy production from hydropower resources.[112] The national electricity law is designed to provide a legal framework and to encourage competition and new investment in the sector.[citation needed] After a two-year delay, the government is proceeding with plans to privatize the various state-owned electricity systems under a different scheme than previously envisioned.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing contributed 15% of GDP in 2009. The manufacturing sector is experiencing severe difficulties, amidst lack of investment and accusations of mismanagement.[113][114] Venezuela manufactures and exports steel, aluminum, transport equipment, textiles, apparel, beverages and foodstuffs. It produces cement, tires, paper, fertilizer and assembles cars both for domestic and export markets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, General Motors Venezolana stopped automotive production after 65 years of service due to a lack of supplies[115][116] while the Central Bank of Venezuela announced that the shortage rate of new automobiles was at 100%.[117] By the first half of 2016, only 10 vehicles were manufactured per day in Venezuela with production dropping 86%.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, estimates showed that Venezuela's industrial production fell about 8% that year alone.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela's land area. Venezuela exports rice, corn, fish, tropical fruit, coffee, beef and pork. The country is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture. Venezuela imports about two-thirds of its food needs. In 2002, American firms exported $347 million worth of agricultural products, including wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, cotton, animal fats, vegetable oils and other items to make Venezuela one of the top two American markets in South America. The United States supplies more than one-third of Venezuela's food imports. Recent government policies have led to problems with food shortages.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nVenezuela is a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the Organization of Gas Exporting Countries (GECF), the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA) and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).[120] Petroleum constitutes 98% of Venezuelas exports with a value of $31.4 billion in 2017.[3] Thanks to petroleum exports, Venezuela usually posts a trade surplus. From 2005, nontraditional (i.e. nonpetroleum) private sector exports have been declining rapidly. By 2015 ,they constitute 8% of total exports.[119] The United States is Venezuela's leading trade partner. During 2002, the United States exported $4.4 billion in goods to Venezuela, making it the 25th-largest market for the United States Including petroleum products, Venezuela exported $15.1 billion in goods to the United States, making it its 14th-largest source of goods. Venezuela opposes the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1998, ChinaÿVenezuela relations have seen an increasing partnership between the government of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chvez and the People's Republic of China. Sino-Venezuelan trade was less than $500m per year before 1999 and reached $7.5bn in 2009, making China Venezuela's second-largest trade partner[121] and Venezuela China's biggest investment destination in Latin America. Various bilateral deals have seen China invest billions in Venezuela and Venezuela increase exports of oil and other resources to China. China has demanded payment in oil for its exports to Venezuela because of its unwillingness to accept Venezuelan currency and the inability of Venezuela to pay in dollars or gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Chvez, Venezuela has also instituted worker-run \\"co-management\\" initiatives in which workers' councils play a key role in the management of a plant or factory. In experimental co-managed enterprises, such as the state-owned Alcasa factory, workers develop budgets and elect both managers and departmental delegates who work together with company executives on technical issues related to production.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2010, workers spent a week protesting outside factories in Valera and Valencia following the expropriation of the American bottle-maker Owens-Illinois.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nLabor disputes have continued to increase since the financial crisis in 2008. According to the World Economic Forum, Venezuela is ranked as 134th of the 148 countries for economic competitiveness. Many in the private sector attribute these findings to the inflexible labor market.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, a barrage of pro-worker decrees have been passed. The most significant could be the 2012 labor laws known as the LOTTT. These laws included the virtual ban on dismissal, shorter work week, improved holidays and enhanced maternity benefits. The LOTTT offers job security to most workers after the first month. Employers have reported an absenteeism rate of up to 40% which they blame on the leniency of these labor laws. As expected, employers have been less willing to recruit.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 November 2014, President Maduro issued a decree to increase the minimum salary for all workers by 15%. The decree became effective on 1 December 2014.[126] As part of the May Day celebrations in honor of workers' day, President Maduro announced on 28 April 2015 that the minimum wage would increase 30%; 20% in May and 10% in July, with the newly announced minimum wage for Venezuelans being only about $30 per month at the widely used black market rate.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2017, the National Union of Workers (UNETE) announced that Venezuela had lost 3,345,000 jobs since the election of President Maduro.[128] By December 2017, the number of lost jobs increased by 400,000 to over 3,850,000 lost jobs since the start of Maduro's tenure.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 20th century when Venezuela benefitted from oil sales, infrastructure flourished in Venezuela.[41] However, in recent years Venezuela's public services and infrastructure has suffered, especially utilities such as electricity and water.[41][130]\\r\\n\\r\\nVenezuela has an extensive road system that was initially created in the 1960s helped aid the oil and aluminum industries.[41] The capital Caracas had a modern subway system designed by the French that was finished in 1995, with the subway tunneling more than over 31.6?mi (51?km).[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1870, Antonio Guzmn Blanco helped create Venezuela's railway system.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chavez government launched a National Railway Development Plan designed to create 15 railway lines across the country, with 8,500 miles (13,700?km) of track by 2030. The network is being built in cooperation with China Railways, which is also cooperating with Venezuela to create factories for tracks, railway cars and eventually locomotives. However, Venezuela's rail project is being put on hold due to Venezuela not being able to pay the $7.5 billion and owing China Railway nearly $500 million.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nLufthansa said it would stop all flights to Venezuela on 18 June 2016, citing difficulties with currency controls.[132] Other airlines also cut back on flights and required that passengers pay fares in US$.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Venezuelan electrical grid is plagued with occasional blackouts in various districts of the country. In 2011, it had so many problems that rations on electricity were put in place to help ease blackouts.[130] On 3 September 2013, 70% of the country plunged into darkness with 14 of 23 states of Venezuela stating they did not have electricity for most of the day.[133] Another power outage on 2 December 2013 left most of Venezuela in the dark again and happened just days before elections.[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Macroeconomic Stabilization Fund (FIEM) decreased from US$2.59 billion in January 2003 to US$700 million in October, but central bank-held international reserves actually increased from US$11.31 billion in January to US$19.67 billion in October 2003. On the black market, the bolvar fell 28% in 2007 to Bs. 4,750 per US$[135] and declined to around VEF 5.5 (Bs 5500) per US$ in early 2009.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economy recovered and grew by 16.8% in 2004. This growth occurred across a wide range of sectorsthe oil industry directly provides only a small percentage of employment in the country. International reserves grew to US$27 billion. Polling firm Datanalysis noted that real income in the poorest sectors of society grew by 33% in 2004.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 March 2007, the government announced that the Venezuelan bolvar would be redenominated at a ratio of 1 to 1,000 at the beginning of 2008 and renamed the bolvar fuerte (\\"strong bolivar\\") to ease accounting and transactions. This was carried out on 1 January 2008, at which time the exchange rate was 2.15 bolvar fuerte per US$.[137] The ISO 4217 code for the bolvar fuerte is VEF.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment spending as a percentage of GDP in Venezuela in 2007 was 30%, smaller than other mixed economies such as France (49%) and Sweden (52%).[138] According to official sources from the United Nations, the percentage of people below the national poverty line has decreased during the presidency of Hugo Chvez, from 48.1% in 2002 to 28% in 2008.[139][140]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the 2007 rise in oil prices and rising government expenditures, Venezuela's economy grew by 9% in 2007. Oil prices fell starting in July 2008, resulting in a major loss of income. Hit by a global recession, the economy contracted by 2% in the second quarter of 2009,[141] contracting a further 4.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Chavez's response has been that these standards mis-state economic fact and that the economy should be measured by socialistic standards.[142] On 17 November, the Central Bank reported that private sector activity declined by 4.5% and that inflation was averaging 26.7%. Compounding such problems is a drought which the government says was caused by El Ni?o, resulting in rationing of water and electricity and a short supply of food.[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 2010 saw Venezuela still in recession as GDP has fallen by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2010.[144] The Central Bank of Venezuela has stated that the recession is due largely \\"to restricted access to foreign currency for imports, lower internal demand and electricity rationing\\". The oil sector's performance was also particularly troubling, with oil GDP shrinking by 5%. More importantly, the Central Bank hints at the root cause of the oil contraction, saying that \\"the bank said it was due to falls in production, \\"operative problems\\", maintenance stoppages and the channeling of diesel to run thermal generators during a power crisis\\".[144] While the public sector of the economy has fallen 2.8%, the private sector has dropped off 6%.[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 2013 proved to be difficult for Venezuela as shortages of necessities and extreme inflation attacked the nation's economy. Items became so scarce that nearly one quarter of items were not in stock.[145] The bolvar was devalued to 6.3 per US$ in early 2013 taking one third of its value away.[146] However, inflation still continued to rise drastically in the country to the point President Maduro forced stores to sell their items just days before elections. Maduro said that the stores were charging unreasonable prices even though the owners were only charging so much due to the actual devaluation of the bolivar.[147]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the year 2014 began, it was pretty rough as well. The Central Bank of Venezuela stopped releasing statistics for the first time in its history as a way to possibly manipulate the image of economy.[148] Venezuela has also dismantled CADIVI, a government body in charge of currency exchange.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980ÿ2017. Inflation under 5?% is in green.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parallel exchange rate is what Venezuelans believe the Venezuelan currency is worth compared to the US$.[150] In the first few years of Chvez's office, his newly created social programs required large payments in order to make the desired changes. On 5 February 2003, the government created CADIVI, a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. Its creation was to control capital flight by placing limits on individuals and only offering them so much of a foreign currency.[151] This limit to foreign currency led to a creation of a currency black market economy since Venezuelan merchants rely on foreign goods that require payments with reliable foreign currencies. As Venezuela printed more money for their social programs, the bolvar continued to devalue for Venezuelan citizens and merchants since the government held the majority of the more reliable currencies.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of January 2018, the strongest official exchange rate was 1 US$ to 10 VEF while the free market exchange rate was over 200,000 VEF to 1 US$.[153][85] Since merchants can only receive so much necessary foreign currency from the government, they must resort to the black market which in turn raises the merchant's prices on consumers.[154] The high rates in the black market make it difficult for businesses to purchase necessary goods since the government often forces these businesses to make price cuts. This leads to businesses selling their goods and making a low profit, such as Venezuelan McDonald's franchises offering a Big Mac meal for only $1.[155] Since businesses make low profits, this leads to shortages since they are unable to import the goods that Venezuela is reliant on. Venezuela's largest food producing company, Empresas Polar, has stated that they may need to suspend some production for nearly the entire year of 2014 since they owe foreign suppliers $463 million.[156] The last report of shortages in Venezuela showed that 22.4% of necessary goods are not in stock.[157] This was the last report by the government since the central bank no longer posts the scarcity index. This has led to speculation that the government is hiding its inability to control the economy which may create doubt about future economic data released.[158]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most Latin American countries, Venezuela has an unequal distribution of wealth. Although distribution improved when the surplus of rural labor started to diminish and the educational system improved in the middle of the 20th century,[159] equality is far from coinciding with western standards. The rich tend to be very rich and the poor very poor. In 1970, the poorest fifth of the population had 3% of national income while the wealthiest fifth had 54%.[160] For comparison, the United Kingdom 1973 figures were 6.3% and 38.8% and the United States in 1972, 4.5% and 42.8%.[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more recent income distribution data available is for distribution per capita, not per household. The two are not strictly comparable because poor households tend to have more members than rich households, thus the per household data tends to show less inequality than the per capita data. The table below shows the available per capita data for recent years from the World Bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that personal (per capita) income distribution, given in this table, is not exactly comparable with household income distribution, given in the previous table, because poor households tend to have more members.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the above publications are by the World Bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoverty in Venezuela increased during the 1980s and early 1990s, but it decreased greatly in the mid to late 1990s. The decreasing trend continued through the Chvez presidency, with the exception of the troubled years 2002 and 2003. Under the Bolivarian government, poverty decreased initially when Venezuela acquired oil funds, though poverty began to increase to its highest level in decades in the 2010s.[164]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table below shows the percentage of people and the percentage of households whose income is below a poverty line which is equal to the price of a market basket of necessities such as food.[165]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 2000s when oil prices soared and offered Chvez funds not seen since the beginning of Venezuela's economic collapse in the 1980s, Chvez's government became \\"semi-authoritarian and hyper-populist\\" and consolidated its power over the economy in order to gain control of large amounts of resources.[41][169] Domestically, Chvez used such oil funds for populist policies, creating the Bolivarian missions, aimed at providing public services to improve economic, cultural and social conditions.[41][170] From 19992009, 60% of government revenues focused on social programs[171][better?source?needed] while social investment went from 8.4% of GDP in 1988 to 18.8% in 2008.[172][better?source?needed] Despite warnings near the beginning of Chvez's tenure in the early 2000s,[41] Chvez's government continuously overspent in social spending and did not save enough money for any future economic turmoil, which Venezuela faced shortly before and after his death.[169][173] On the year of Chvez's death, Venezuela was still categorized as having high human development on its Human Development Index in 2013 according to the United Nations Development Programme, although human development began to decline in Venezuela within a year, with the country dropping 10 ranks by 2014.[174]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough poverty initially declined under Chvez, Venezuela's poverty rate increased to 28% by 2013, with extreme poverty rates increasing 44% to 10% according to the Venezuelan government's INE.[175] Estimates of poverty by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and Luis Pedro Espa?a, a sociologist at the Universidad Cat܇lica Andrs Bello, showed an increase of poverty in Venezuela.[176] ECLAC showed a 2013 poverty rate of 32% while Pedro Espa?a calculated a 2015 rate of 48%.[176] The Venezuelan government estimated that 33% were in poverty in the first half of 2015 and then stopped producing statistics.[25] According to Venezuelan NGO PROVEA, by the end of 2015 there would be the same number of Venezuelans living in poverty as there was in 2000, reversing the advancements against poverty by Chvez.[176] The ENCOVI annual survey by three universities estimated poverty at 48% in 2014, 82% in 2016 and 87% in 2017.[177]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn relation to hunger, under-nutrition, undernourishment and the percentage of children under the age of five who are moderately or severely underweight decreased earlier in Chvez's tenure.[178] However, shortages in Venezuela as a result of price control policies left the majority of Venezuelans without adequate products after his death.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the country's economy collapsed in 2014, hunger and malnutrition have become a severe problem.[179] In 2015, close to 45% of Venezuelans said they were unable to afford food at times. In 2018, this figure rose to 79%, one of the highest rates in the world.[180]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to government figures released in April 2017, 1,446 children under the age of 1 had died in 2016, representing a 30 percent increase in one year.[179] As of August 2017, 31 million people suffered from severe food shortages.[181] The ENCOVI universities survey found that 73% of Venezuelans said they had lost 9?kg (19 lbs) of body weight in 2016[182] and 64% had lost 11?kg (25 lbs) in 2017.[183][177]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total net enrollment ratio in primary education for both sexes increased from 87% in 1999 to 93.9% in 2009.[178]  The primary completion rate for both sexes reached 95.1% in 2009 as compared to 80.8% in 1991.[178]  The literacy rates of 15- to 24-year-olds in 2007, for men and women, were 98% and 98.8%, respectively.[178] During the Bolivarian diaspora, a large percentage of the millions of Venezuelans who left the country were highly educated, resulting in a brain drain in the country.[184][185]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince starting in 2003, the free government program Mission Robinson had taught more than 2.3 million people to read and write as of 2012. The program also focused much of its attention on reaching out to geographically isolated and historically excluded members of the population, including indigenous groups and Afro-descendants.[186][better?source?needed] In 2008, Francisco Rodrguez of Wesleyan University in Connecticut and Daniel Ortega of IESA stated that there was \\"little evidence\\" of \\"statistically distinguishable effect on Venezuelan illiteracy\\" during the Chvez administration.[187] The Venezuelan government claimed that it had taught 1.5 million Venezuelans to read,[188] but the study found that \\"only 1.1m were illiterate to begin with\\" and that the illiteracy reduction of less than 100,000 can be attributed to adults that were elderly and died.[187]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the Bolivarian Revolution and the establishment of the Bolivarian government, initial healthcare practices were promising with the installation of free healthcare and the assistance received from Cuban medical professionals providing aid. The Bolivarian government's failure to concentrate on healthcare for Venezuelans, the reduction of healthcare spending and government corruption eventually affected medical practices in Venezuela, causing avoidable deaths along with an emigration of medical professionals to other countries.[65][189]\\r\\n\\r\\nVenezuela's reliance of imported goods and its complicated exchange rates initiated under Chvez led to increasing shortages during the late-2000s and into the 2010s that affected the availability of medicines and medical equipment in the country.[189] The United Nations reported an increase in the maternal mortality ratio, which increased from 93 per 100,000 in 1990 to 110 per 100,000 in 2013.[190] Following shortages of many medical and common goods in 2014, Venezuelan women have had difficulties accessing contraceptives and were forced to change prescriptions or search several stores and the Internet for their medications.[191] Shortage of antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV/AIDS affected about 50,000 Venezuelans in 2014 as well, potentially causing thousands of Venezuelans with HIV to develop AIDS.[192]\\r\\n\\r\\nVenezuela is also the only country in Latin America where the incidence of malaria is increasing, allegedly due to illegal mining. In 2013, Venezuela registered the highest number of cases of malaria in the past 50 years, with 300 of 100,000 Venezuelans being infected with the disease.[193]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, the number of Internet users was minimal, but 35.63% of Venezuelans were Internet users by 2010.[178] In fact, the number of Internet subscribers has increased sixfold.[194] Programs such as the National Technological Literacy Plan, which provides free software and computers to schools, have assisted Venezuela in meeting this goal.[195] However, several experts state that the poor infrastructure in Venezuela had created a poor quality of Internet in Venezuela, which has one of the slowest Internet speeds in the world.[196] The lack of US$ due to the Venezuelan governments currency controls has also damaged Internet services because technological equipment must be imported into Venezuela.[196]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of fixed telephone lines per 100 inhabitants was 7.56 in 1990. The number increased to 24.44 in 2010.[178] In 2000, 2,535,966 Venezuelans had landline telephones. By 2009, this had increased to 6,866,626.[171]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bolivarian government has also launched an aerospace program in cooperation with the People's Republic of China who built and launched two satellites that are currently in orbita communications satellite called Sim܇n Bolvar and a remote sensing satellite called Miranda. In July 2014, President Maduro announced that a third satellite would be built by ChineseÿVenezuelan bilateral cooperation.[197][198]","input":"What commodity is much of venezuelas economy based?"},{"output":"Confederacy","context":"114,691 (\\"present for duty equipped\\"):[1][2]\\r\\nThe Seven Days Battles were a series of six major battles over the seven days from June 25 to July 1, 1862, near Richmond, Virginia, during the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee drove the invading Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula. The series of battles is sometimes known erroneously as the Seven Days Campaign, but it was actually the culmination of the Peninsula Campaign, not a separate campaign in its own right.\\r\\nThe Seven Days began on Wednesday, June 25, 1862, with a Union attack in the minor Battle of Oak Grove, but McClellan quickly lost the initiative as Lee began a series of attacks at Beaver Dam Creek (Mechanicsville) on June 26, Gaines's Mill on June 27, the minor actions at Garnett's and Golding's Farm on June 27 and 28, and the attack on the Union rear guard at Savage's Station on June 29. McClellan's Army of the Potomac continued its retreat toward the safety of Harrison's Landing on the James River. Lee's final opportunity to intercept the Union Army was at the Battle of Glendale on June 30, but poorly executed orders and the delay of Stonewall Jackson's troops allowed his enemy to escape to a strong defensive position on Malvern Hill. At the Battle of Malvern Hill on July 1, Lee launched futile frontal assaults and suffered heavy casualties in the face of strong infantry and artillery defenses.\\r\\nThe Seven Days ended with McClellan's army in relative safety next to the James River, having suffered almost 16,000 casualties during the retreat. Lee's army, which had been on the offensive during the Seven Days, lost over 20,000. As Lee became convinced that McClellan would not resume his threat against Richmond, he moved north for the Northern Virginia Campaign and the Maryland Campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Peninsula Campaign was the unsuccessful attempt by McClellan to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond and end the war. It started in March 1862, when McClellan landed his army at Fort Monroe and moved northwest, up the Virginia Peninsula beginning in early April. Confederate Brig. Gen. John B. Magruder's defensive position on the Warwick Line caught McClellan by surprise. His hopes for a quick advance foiled, McClellan ordered his army to prepare for a siege of Yorktown. Just before the siege preparations were completed, the Confederates, now under the direct command of Johnston, began a withdrawal toward Richmond.[8]\\r\\nThe first heavy fighting of the campaign occurred in the Battle of Williamsburg (May 5), in which the Union troops managed some tactical victories, but the Confederates continued their withdrawal. An amphibious flanking movement to Eltham's Landing (May 7) was ineffective in cutting off the Confederate retreat. In the Battle of Drewry's Bluff (May 15), an attempt by the United States Navy to reach Richmond by way of the James River was repulsed.[8]\\r\\nAs McClellan's army reached the outskirts of Richmond, a minor battle occurred at Hanover Court House (May 27), but it was followed by a surprise attack by Johnston at the Battle of Seven Pines or Fair Oaks on May 31 and June 1. The battle was inconclusive, with heavy casualties, but it had lasting effects on the campaign. Johnston was wounded and replaced on June 1 by the more aggressive Robert E. Lee. Lee spent almost a month extending his defensive lines and organizing his Army of Northern Virginia; McClellan accommodated this by sitting passively to his front, waiting for dry weather and roads, until the start of the Seven Days.[9] + Lee, who had developed a reputation for caution early in the war, knew he had no numerical superiority over McClellan, but he planned an offensive campaign that was the first indication of the aggressive nature he would display for the remainder of the war.[9]\\r\\nLee's initial attack plan, similar to Johnston's plan at Seven Pines, was complex and required expert coordination and execution by all of his subordinates, but Lee knew that he could not win in a battle of attrition or siege against the Union Army. It was developed at a meeting on June 23. The Union Army straddled the rain-swollen Chickahominy River, with the bulk of the army, four corps, arrayed in a semicircular line south of the river. The remainder, the V Corps under Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, was north of the river near Mechanicsville in an L-shaped line facing north-south behind Beaver Dam Creek and southeast along the Chickahominy. Lee's plan was to cross the Chickahominy with the bulk of his army to attack the Union north flank, leaving only two divisions (under Maj. Gens. Benjamin Huger and John B. Magruder) to hold a line of entrenchments against McClellan's superior strength. This would concentrate about 65,500 troops to oppose 30,000, leaving only 25,000 to protect Richmond and to contain the other 60,000 men of the Union Army. The Confederate cavalry under Brig. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart had reconnoitered Porter's right flankas part of a daring but militarily dubious circumnavigation of the entire Union Army from June 12 to 15and found it vulnerable.[10]\\r\\nLee intended for Jackson to attack Porter's right flank early on the morning of June 26, and A.P. Hill would move from Meadow Bridge to Beaver Dam Creek, which flows into the Chickahominy, advancing on the Federal trenches. (Lee hoped that Porter would evacuate his trenches under pressure, obviating the need for a direct frontal assault.) Following this, Longstreet and D.H. Hill would pass through Mechanicsville and join the battle. Huger and Magruder would provide diversions on their fronts to distract McClellan as to Lee's real intentions. Lee hoped that Porter would be overwhelmed from two sides by the mass of 65,000 men, and the two leading Confederate divisions would move on Cold Harbor and cut McClellan's communications with White House Landing.[11]\\r\\nMcClellan also planned an offensive. He had received intelligence that Lee was prepared to move and that the arrival of Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's force from the Shenandoah Valley was imminent (McClellan was aware of Jackson's presence at Ashland Station, but did nothing to reinforce Porter's vulnerable corps north of the river).[12] He decided to resume the offensive before Lee could. Anticipating Jackson's reinforcements marching from the north, he increased cavalry patrols on likely avenues of approach. He wanted to advance his siege artillery about a mile and a half closer to the city by taking the high ground on Nine Mile Road around Old Tavern. In preparation for that, he planned an attack on Oak Grove, south of Old Tavern and the Richmond and York River Railroad, which would position his men to attack Old Tavern from two directions.[13]\\r\\nThe armies that fought in the Seven Days Battles comprised almost 200,000 men, which offered the potential for the largest battles of the war. However, the inexperience or caution of the generals involved usually prevented the appropriate concentration of forces and mass necessary for decisive tactical victories.\\r\\nThe Confederate army was not a proper unified command as the Army of the Potomac was, but simply a thrown-together collection of all the troops that could be gathered for the defense of Richmond. This contributed to the poor coordination of the army during the battles and the inability of Robert E. Lee to destroy the Union army.\\r\\nThe average strength of a division in the Army of the Potomac was about 9000 men (including non-combatants) with Casey's division being the smallest at around 7000 and Morell's being the largest at 11,000 men. The average strength of Confederate divisions varied from 12,000 men (A.P. Hill's division) to 5000 men (Theophilus Holmes's division). Confederate reports listed only combat troops and excluded non-combatants such as couriers, staff officers, and wagon drivers. Jackson's command was severely understrength from the Valley Campaign and his own division had less than 2000 men, most of them being in the Stonewall Brigade while the brigades of Samuel Fulkerson and John R. Jones were down to nearly regimental size and were held in reserve for most of the Seven Days Battles. Ewell's three brigades numbered 3000 men total. Jackson was reinforced with the brigade of Alexander Lawton, recently arrived from Georgia, and numbering 3500 men. This brought his total strength to around 8000 men.\\r\\nD.H. Hill's division numbered around 7700 men, having numbered close to 10,000 before the heavy losses at Seven Pines. They were reinforced with Roswell Ripley's brigade, newly arrived from North Carolina, and numbering 2300 men, bringing the total strength of Hill's command to 10,000 men. James Longstreet's division numbered 9050 men on June 25 according to army ordnance chief Edward P. Alexander. It had numbered close to 12,000 men prior to losses at Seven Pines. Benjamin Huger's division numbered approximately 8600 men. William Whiting had around 4000 men in his two brigades. John Magruder's three divisions numbered about 13,000 men.\\r\\nMcClellan's Army of the Potomac, with approximately 105,000 men,[2] was organized largely as it had been at Seven Pines.[14]\\r\\nLee's Army of Northern Virginia was larger than the one he inherited from Johnston, and, at about 92,000 men,[3] the largest Confederate army assembled during the war.[15]\\r\\nMcClellan planned to advance to the west, along the axis of the Williamsburg Road, in the direction of Richmond. Between the two armies was a small, dense forest, 1,200 yards (1,100?m) wide, bisected by the headwaters of White Oak Swamp. Two divisions of the III Corps were selected for the assault, commanded by Brig. Gens. Joseph Hooker and Philip Kearny. Facing them was the division of Confederate Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger.[16]\\r\\nSoon after 8 a.m., June 25, the Union brigades of Brig. Gens. Daniel E. Sickles (the Excelsior Brigade), Cuvier Grover, both of Hooker's division, and John C. Robinson stepped off. Although Robinson and Grover made good progress on the left and in the center, Sickles's New Yorkers encountered difficulties moving through their abatis, then through the upper portions of the creek, and finally met stiff Confederate resistance, all of which threw the Federal line out of alignment. Huger took advantage of the confusion by launching a counterattack with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright against Grover's brigade. At a crucial moment in the battle, the 26th North Carolina of Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom's brigade, in their first combat engagement, delivered a perfectly synchronized volley of rifle fire against Sickles's brigade, breaking up its delayed attack and sending the 71st New York into a panicked retreat, which Sickles described as \\"disgraceful confusion.\\"[17]\\r\\nHeintzelman ordered reinforcements sent forward and also notified army commander McClellan, who was attempting to manage the battle by telegraph from 3 miles (4.8?km) away. McClellan ordered his men to withdraw back to their entrenchments, mystifying his subordinates on the scene. Arriving at the front at 1 p.m., seeing that the situation was not as bad as he had feared, McClellan ordered his men forward to retake the ground for which they had already fought once that day. The fighting lasted until nightfall.[18]\\r\\nThe minor battle was McClellan's only tactical offensive action against Richmond. His attack gained only 600 yards (550?m) at a cost of over 1,000 casualties on both sides and was not strong enough to derail the offensive planned by Robert E. Lee, which already had been set in motion.[19]\\r\\nLee's plan called for Jackson to begin the attack on Porter's north flank early on June 26. A.P. Hill's Light Division was to advance from Meadow Bridge when he heard Jackson's guns, clear the Union pickets from Mechanicsville, and then move to Beaver Dam Creek. D.H. Hill and Longstreet were to pass through Mechanicsville and support Jackson and A.P. Hill. South of the river, Magruder and Huger were to demonstrate to deceive the four Union corps on their front.[20]\\r\\nLee's intricate plan went awry immediately. Jackson's men, fatigued from their recent campaign and lengthy march, ran at least four hours behind schedule. By 3 p.m., A.P. Hill grew impatient and began his attack without orders, a frontal assault with 11,000 men. Porter extended and strengthened his right flank and fell back to concentrate along Beaver Dam Creek and Ellerson's Mill. There, 14,000 well entrenched soldiers, aided by 32 guns in six batteries, repulsed repeated Confederate attacks with substantial casualties.[21]\\r\\nCol. Vincent J. Esposito, The West Point Atlas of American Wars[22]\\r\\nJackson and his command arrived late in the afternoon and he ordered his troops to bivouac for the evening while a major battle was raging within earshot. His proximity to Porter's flank caused McClellan to order Porter to withdraw after dark behind Boatswain's Swamp, 5 miles (8.0?km) to the east. McClellan was concerned that the Confederate buildup on his right flank threatened his supply line, the Richmond and York River Railroad north of the Chickahominy, and he decided to shift his base of supply to the James River. He also believed that the diversions by Huger and Magruder south of the river meant that he was seriously outnumbered. (He reported to Washington that he faced 200,000 Confederates, but there were actually 85,000.)[23] This was a strategic decision of grave importance because it meant that, without the railroad to supply his army, he would be forced to abandon his siege of Richmond. A.P. Hill, now with Longstreet and D.H. Hill behind him, continued his attack, despite orders from Lee to hold his ground. His assault was beaten back with heavy casualties.[24]\\r\\nOverall, the battle was a Union tactical victory, in which the Confederates suffered heavy casualties and achieved none of their specific objectives due to the seriously flawed execution of Lee's plan. Instead of over 60,000 men crushing the enemy's flank, only five brigades, about 15,000 men, had seen action. Their losses were 1,484 versus Porter's 361. Despite the short-term Union success, however, it was the start of a strategic debacle. McClellan began to withdraw his army to the southeast and never regained the initiative.[25]\\r\\nBy the morning of June 27, the Union forces were concentrated into a semicircle with Porter collapsing his line into an east-west salient north of the river and the four corps south of the river remaining in their original positions. McClellan ordered Porter to hold Gaines's Mill at all costs so that the army could change its base of supply to the James River. Several of McClellan's subordinates urged him to attack Magruder's division south of the river, but he feared the vast numbers of Confederates he believed to be before him and refused to capitalize on the overwhelming superiority he actually held on that front.[26]\\r\\nLee continued his offensive on June 27, launching the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions.[27] A.P. Hill resumed his attack across Beaver Dam Creek early in the morning, but found the line lightly defended. By early afternoon, he ran into strong opposition where Porter had deployed along Boatswain's Creek; the swampy terrain was a major obstacle to the attack. As Longstreet arrived to the south of A.P. Hill, he saw the difficulty of attacking over such terrain and delayed until Stonewall Jackson could attack on Hill's left.[28]\\r\\nFor the second time in the Seven Days, however, Jackson was late. D.H. Hill attacked the Federal right and was held off by the division of Brig. Gen. George Sykes; he backed off to await Jackson's arrival. Longstreet was ordered to conduct a diversionary attack to stabilize the lines until Jackson could arrive and attack from the north. In Longstreet's attack, Brig. Gen. George E. Pickett's brigade attempted a frontal assault and was beaten back under severe fire with heavy losses. Jackson finally reached D.H. Hill's position at 3 p.m. and began his assault at 4:30?p.m.[29]\\r\\nPorter's line was saved by Brig. Gen. Henry W. Slocum's division moving into position to bolster his defense. Shortly after dark, the Confederates mounted another attack, poorly coordinated, but this time collapsing the Federal line. Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood's Texas Brigade opened a gap in the line, as did Pickett's Brigade on its second attempt of the day. By 4 a.m. on June 28, Porter withdrew across the Chickahominy, burning the bridges behind him.[30]\\r\\nFor the second day, Magruder was able to continue fooling McClellan south of the river by employing minor diversionary attacks. He was able to occupy 60,000 Federal troops while the heavier action occurred north of the river.[31]\\r\\nGaines's Mill was the only clear-cut Confederate tactical victory of the Peninsula Campaign.[32] Union casualties from the 34,214 engaged were 6,837 (894 killed, 3,107 wounded, and 2,836 captured or missing). Of the 57,018 Confederates engaged, losses totaled 7,993 (1,483 killed, 6,402 wounded, 108 missing or captured).[33] Since the Confederate assault was conducted against only a small portion of the Union Army (the V Corps, one fifth of the army), the army emerged from the battle in relatively good shape overall. However, although McClellan had already planned to shift his supply base to the James River, his defeat unnerved him and he precipitously decided to abandon his advance on Richmond.[34]\\r\\nThe night of June 27, McClellan ordered his entire army to withdraw to a secure base at Harrison's Landing on the James River. His actions have puzzled military historians ever since. The Union army was in a good position, having withstood strong Confederate attacks while only deploying one of its five corps in battle. Porter had performed well against heavy odds. Furthermore, McClellan was aware that the War Department had created a new Army of Virginia and ordered it to be sent to the Peninsula to reinforce him. But Lee had unnerved him, and he surrendered the initiative. He sent a telegram to the Secretary of War that included the statement: \\"If I save this Army now I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you or any other persons in Washingtonyou have done your best to sacrifice this Army.\\" (The military telegraph department chose to omit this sentence from the copy given to the Secretary.)[35]\\r\\nMcClellan ordered Keyes's IV Corps to move west of Glendale and protect the army's withdrawal, while Porter was sent to the high ground at Malvern Hill to develop defensive positions. The supply trains were ordered to move south toward the river. McClellan departed for Harrison's Landing without specifying any exact routes of withdrawal and without designating a second-in-command. For the remainder of the Seven Days, he had no direct command of the battles. The Union retreat across the Chickahominy after Gaines's Mill was a psychological victory for the Confederacy, signaling that Richmond was out of danger.[36]\\r\\nLee's cavalry reported that Union troops had abandoned their defense of the Richmond and York River Railroad and the White House supply depot on the York River. That information, plus the sighting of large dust clouds south of the Chickahominy River, finally convinced Lee that McClellan was heading for the James. Until this time, Lee anticipated that McClellan would be withdrawing to the east to protect his supply line to the York River and positioned his forces to react to that, unable to act decisively while he awaited evidence of McClellan's intentions.[37]\\r\\nWhile Lee's main attack at Gaines's Mill was progressing on June 27, the Confederates south of the Chickahominy performed a reconnaissance in force to determine the location of McClellan's retreating army. Magruder ordered Brig. Gen. Robert A. Toombs's brigade forward to \\"feel the enemy.\\" Toombs, a Georgia politician with a disdain for professional officers, instead launched a sharp attack at dusk against Baldy Smith's VI Corps division near Old Tavern at the farm of James M. Garnett. The attack was easily repulsed by the brigade of Brig. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock.[38]\\r\\nOn June 28, Toombs again was ordered to conduct a reconnaissance, but turned it into an attack over the same ground, meeting the enemy at the farm of Simon Gouldin (also known as Golding). Toombs took it upon himself to order his fellow brigade commander, Col. George T. Anderson, to join the assault. Two of Anderson's regiments, the 7th and 8th Georgia, preceded Toombs's brigade into the assault and were subjected to a vigorous Federal counterattack by the 49th Pennsylvania and 43rd New York, losing 156 men.[39]\\r\\nThese were the only attacks south of the Chickahominy River in conjunction with Gaines's Mill, but they helped to convince McClellan that he was being subjected to attacks from all directions, increasing his anxiety and his determination to get his army to safety at the James.[40]\\r\\nOn Sunday, June 29, the bulk of McClellan's army concentrated around Savage's Station on the Richmond and York River Railroad, a Federal supply depot since just before Seven Pines, preparing for a difficult crossing through and around White Oak Swamp. It did so without centralized direction because McClellan had personally moved south of Malvern Hill after Gaines's Mill without leaving directions for corps movements during the retreat nor naming a second in command. Clouds of black smoke filled the air as the Union troops were ordered to burn anything they could not carry. Union morale plummeted, particularly so for those wounded, who realized that they were not being evacuated from Savage's Station with the rest of the Army.[41]\\r\\nLee devised a complex plan to pursue and destroy McClellan's army. Longstreet's and A.P. Hill's divisions looped back toward Richmond and then southeast to the crossroads at Glendale, Holmes's division headed farther south, to the vicinity of Malvern Hill, and Magruder's division was ordered to move due east to attack the Federal rear guard. Stonewall Jackson, commanding three divisions, was to rebuild a bridge over the Chickahominy and head due south to Savage's Station, where he would link up with Magruder and deliver a strong blow that might cause the Union Army to turn around and fight during its retreat.[42] McClellan's rear guard at Savage's Station consisted five divisions from Sumner's II Corps, Heintzelman's III Corps, and Franklin's VI Corps. McClellan considered his senior corps commander, Sumner, to be incompetent, so he appointed no one to command the rear guard.[43]\\r\\nInitial contact between the armies occurred at 9 a.m. on June 29, a four-regiment fight about 2 miles (3.2?km) west of Savage's Station, lasting for about two hours before disengaging.[44] Meanwhile, Jackson was not advancing as Lee had planned. He was taking time to rebuild bridges over the Chickahominy and he received a garbled order from Lee's chief of staff that made him believe he should stay north of the river and guard the crossings. These failures of the Confederate plan were being matched on the Union side, however. Heintzelman decided on his own that his corps was not needed to defend Savage's Station, so he decided to follow the rest of the army without informing his fellow generals.[45]\\r\\nMagruder was faced with the problem of attacking Sumner's 26,600 men with his own 14,000. He hesitated until 5 p.m., when he sent only two and a half brigades forward. Union artillery opened fire and pickets were sent forward to meet the assault.[46] The two brigade front of Kershaw and Semmes began to push the narrow defensive line of one of Sedgwick's brigades. Sumner managed this part of the battle erratically, selecting regiments for combat from multiple brigades almost at random. By the time all of these units reached the front, the two sides were at rough paritytwo brigades each. Although Magruder had been conservative about his attack, Sumner was even more so. Of the 26 regiments he had in his corps, only 10 were engaged at Savage's Station.[47]\\r\\nThe fighting turned into a bloody stalemate as darkness fell and strong thunderstorms began to move in. The \\"Land Merrimack\\"the first instance of an armored railroad battery to be used in combatbombarded the Union front, with some of its shells reaching as far to the rear as the field hospital. The final action of the evening was as the Vermont Brigade, attempting to hold the flank south of the Williamsburg Road, charged into the woods and were met with murderous fire, suffering more casualties of any brigade on the field that day.[48]\\r\\nThere were about 1,500 casualties on both sides, plus 2,500 previously wounded Union soldiers who were left to be captured when their field hospital was evacuated. Stonewall Jackson eventually crossed the river by about 2:30?a.m. on June 30, but it was too late to crush the Union Army, as Lee had hoped. General Lee reprimanded Magruder, but the fault for the lost opportunity must be shared equally with the poor staff work at Lee's own headquarters and a less than aggressive performance by Jackson.[49]\\r\\nMost elements of the Union Army had been able to cross White Oak Swamp Creek by noon on June 30. About one third of the army had reached the James River, but the remainder was still marching between White Oak Swamp and Glendale. After inspecting the line of march that morning, McClellan rode south and boarded the ironclad USS Galena on the James.[50]\\r\\nLee ordered his army to converge on the retreating Union forces, bottlenecked on the inadequate road network. The Army of the Potomac, lacking overall command coherence, presented a discontinuous, ragged defensive line. Stonewall Jackson was ordered to press the Union rear guard at the White Oak Swamp crossing while the largest part of Lee's army, some 45,000 men, would attack the Army of the Potomac in mid-retreat at Glendale, about 2 miles (3.2?km) southwest, splitting it in two. Huger's division would strike first after a three-mile (5?km) march on the Charles City Road, supported by Longstreet and A.P. Hill, whose divisions were about 7 miles (11?km) to the west, in a mass attack. Holmes was ordered to capture Malvern Hill.[51]\\r\\nThe Confederate plan was once again marred by poor execution. Huger's men were slowed by felled trees obstructing the Charles City Road, spending hours chopping a new road through the thick woods. Huger failed to take any alternative route, and, fearing a counterattack, failed to participate in the battle. Magruder marched around aimlessly, unable to decide whether he should be aiding Longstreet or Holmes; by 4 p.m., Lee ordered Magruder to join Holmes on the River Road and attack Malvern Hill. Stonewall Jackson moved slowly and spent the entire day north of the creek, making only feeble efforts to cross and attack Franklin's VI Corps in the Battle of White Oak Swamp, attempting to rebuild a destroyed bridge (although adequate fords were nearby), and engaging in a pointless artillery duel. Jackson's inaction allowed some units to be detached from Franklin's corps in late afternoon to reinforce the Union troops at Glendale. Holmes's relatively inexperienced troops made no progress against Porter at Turkey Bridge on Malvern Hill, even with the reinforcements from Magruder, and were repulsed by effective artillery fire and by Federal gunboats on the James.[52]\\r\\nAt 2 p.m., as they waited for sounds of Huger's expected attack, Lee, Longstreet, and visiting Confederate President Jefferson Davis were conferring on horseback when they came under heavy artillery fire, wounding two men and killing three horses. A.P. Hill, the commander in that sector, ordered the president and senior generals to the rear. Longstreet attempted to silence the six batteries of Federal guns firing in his direction, but long-range artillery fire proved to be inadequate. He ordered Col. Micah Jenkins to charge the batteries, which brought on a general fight around 4 p.m.[53]\\r\\nAlthough belated and not initiated as planned, the assaults by the divisions of A.P. Hill and Longstreet, under Longstreet's overall command, turned out to be the only ones to follow Lee's order to attack the main Union concentration. Longstreet's 20,000 men were not reinforced by other Confederate divisions of Huger and Jackson, despite their concentration within a three-mile (5?km) radius. They assaulted the disjointed Union line of 40,000 men, arranged in a two-mile (3?km) arc north and south of the Glendale intersection, but the brunt of the fighting was centered on the position held by the Pennsylvania Reserves division of the V Corps, 6,000 men under Brig. Gen. George A. McCall, just west of the Nelson Farm. (The farm was owned by R.H. Nelson, but its former owner was named Frayser and many of the locals referred to it as Frayser's, or Frazier's, Farm.)[54]\\r\\nThree Confederate brigades made the assault, but Longstreet ordered them forward in a piecemeal fashion,[55] over several hours. Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper's Virginians charged through the thick woods first and emerged in front of five batteries of McCall's artillery. In their first combat experience, the brigade conducted a disorderly but enthusiastic assault, which carried them through the guns and broke through McCall's main line with Jenkins's support, followed up a few hours later by Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox's Alabamans. The Confederate brigades met stiff resistance in sometimes hand-to-hand combat.[56]\\r\\nOn McCall's flanks, the divisions of Brig. Gen. Joseph Hooker (to the south) and Brig. Gens. Philip Kearny and Henry W. Slocum (to the north), held against repeated Confederate attacks. Brig. Gen. John Sedgwick's division, which had units both in reserve and around White Oak Swamp, came up to fill a gap after a brutal counterattack. Heavy fighting continued until about 8:30?p.m. Longstreet committed virtually every brigade in the divisions under his command, while on the Union side they had been fed in individually to plug holes in the line as they occurred.[57]\\r\\nThe battle was tactically inconclusive, although Lee failed to achieve his objective of preventing the Federal escape and crippling McClellan's army, if not destroying it. Union casualties were 3,797, Confederate about the same at 3,673, but more than 40% higher in killed and wounded. Although Jackson's wing of the army and Franklin's corps comprised tens of thousands of men, the action at White Oak Swamp included no infantry activity and was limited to primarily an artillery duel with few casualties.[58]\\r\\nThe final battle of the Seven Days was the first in which the Union Army occupied favorable ground. Malvern Hill offered good observation and artillery positions, having been prepared the previous day by Porter's V Corps. McClellan himself was not present on the battlefield, having preceded his army to Harrison's Landing on the James, and Porter was the most senior of the corps commanders. The slopes were cleared of timber, providing great visibility, and the open fields to the north could be swept by deadly fire from the 250 guns[59] placed by Col. Henry J. Hunt, McClellan's chief of artillery. Beyond this space, the terrain was swampy and thickly wooded. Almost the entire Army of the Potomac occupied the hill and the line extended in a vast semicircle from Harrison's Landing on the extreme right to Brig. Gen. George W. Morell's division of Porter's corps on the extreme left, which occupied the geographically advantageous ground on the northwestern slopes of the hill.[60]\\r\\nRather than flanking the position, Lee attacked it directly, hoping that his artillery would clear the way for a successful infantry assault. His plan was to attack the hill from the north on the Quaker Road, using the divisions of Stonewall Jackson, Richard S. Ewell, D.H. Hill, and Brig. Gen. William H.C. Whiting. Magruder was ordered to follow Jackson and deploy to his right when he reached the battlefield. Huger's division was to follow as well, but Lee reserved the right to position him based on developments. The divisions of Longstreet and A.P. Hill, which had been the most heavily engaged in Glendale the previous day, were held in reserve.[61]\\r\\nOnce again, Lee's complex plan was poorly executed. The approaching soldiers were delayed by severely muddy roads and poor maps. Jackson arrived at the swampy creek called Western Run and stopped abruptly. Magruder's guides mistakenly sent him on the Long Bridge Road to the southwest, away from the battlefield. Eventually the battle line was assembled with Huger's division (brigades of Brig. Gens. Ambrose R. Wright and Lewis A. Armistead) on the Confederate right and D.H. Hill's division (brigades of Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood and Col. Evander M. Law) on the Quaker Road to the left. They awaited the Confederate bombardment before attacking.[62]\\r\\nUnfortunately for Lee, Henry Hunt struck first, launching one of the greatest artillery barrages in the war from 1 p.m. to 2:30?p.m. The Union gunners had superior equipment and expertise and disabled most of the Confederate batteries. Despite the setback, Lee sent his infantry forward at 3:30?p.m. and Armistead's brigade made some progress through lines of Union sharpshooters. By 4 p.m., Magruder arrived and he was ordered forward to support Armistead. His attack was piecemeal and poorly organized. Meanwhile, D. H. Hill launched his division forward along the Quaker Road, past Willis Church. Across the entire line of battle, the Confederate troops reached only within 200 yards (180?m) of the Union Center and were repulsed by nightfall with heavy losses.[63] Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill is quoted as saying that, \\"It wasn't war, it was murder.\\"\\r\\nLee's army suffered 5,355 casualties (versus 3,214 Union) in this wasted effort, but continued to follow the Union army all the way to Harrison's Landing. On Evelington Heights, part of the property of Edmund Ruffin, the Confederates had an opportunity to dominate the Union camps, making their position on the bank of the James potentially untenable; although the Confederate position would be subjected to Union naval gunfire, the heights were an exceptionally strong defensive position that would have been very difficult for the Union to capture with infantry. Cavalry commander Jeb Stuart reached the heights and began bombardment with a single cannon. This alerted the Federals to the potential danger and they captured the heights before any Confederate infantry could reach the scene.[64]\\r\\nGeneral Robert E. Lee[65]\\r\\nMaj. Gen. George B. McClellan, letter to his wife[65]\\r\\nThe Seven Days Battles ended the Peninsula Campaign. Malvern Hill was not a tenable position to stay in, and the Army of the Potomac quickly withdrew to Harrison's Landing, where it was protected by Union gunboats on the James River. The army was in no condition for a renewed offensive; close to 16,000 men and officers had been killed or wounded between June 25 and July 1, particularly in the V Corps, which had done the heaviest fighting, while the survivors were extremely tired after a week of fighting and marching with little food or sleep, most of the artillery ammunition had been used up, and the summer weather was taking its toll with the army sick lists getting longer and longer. Meanwhile, the equally-exhausted Army of Northern Virginia, with no reason to remain in the James bottomlands, pulled back to the Richmond lines to lick its wounds.\\r\\nMcClellan wrote a series of letters to the War Department arguing that he was facing upwards of 200,000 Confederates and that he needed major reinforcements to launch a renewed offensive on Richmond. By giving him the commands in Northern Virginia, troops from the Washington garrison, and whatever forces could be pulled from the West, he argued that he might have a fighting chance. General-in-chief Henry Halleck replied back that McClellan's requests were impossible and that if the Confederate army were really as large as he claimed, then trying to reinforce him with Pope and Burnside's commands in Northern Virginia was suicide, since the Confederates could easily crush either Union army with overwhelming strength. Halleck also pointed out that mosquito season was coming up in August-September, and to remain on the swampy Virginia Peninsula at that time of the year was inviting a disastrous malaria and yellow fever epidemic. On August 4, the order came down for McClellan to withdraw from the Peninsula and return to the Aquia Creek area at once.[66]\\r\\nBoth sides suffered heavy casualties. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia suffered about 20,000 casualties (3,494 killed, 15,758 wounded, and 952 captured or missing) out of a total of over 90,000 soldiers during the Seven Days. McClellan reported casualties of about 16,000 (1,734 killed, 8,062 wounded, and 6,053 captured or missing) out of a total of 105,445. Despite their victory, many Confederates were stunned by the losses.[67]\\r\\nThe effects of the Seven Days Battles were widespread. After a successful start on the Peninsula that foretold an early end to the war, Northern morale was crushed by McClellan's retreat. Despite heavy casualties and clumsy tactical performances by Lee and his generals, Confederate morale skyrocketed, and Lee was emboldened to continue his aggressive strategy through Second Bull Run and the Maryland Campaign. McClellan's previous position as general-in-chief of all the Union armies, vacant since March, was filled on July 23, 1862, by Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, although McClellan did retain command of the Army of the Potomac. Meanwhile, Robert E. Lee embarked on a thorough reorganization of the Army of Northern Virginia, forming it into two corps commanded by James Longstreet and Stonewall Jackson. Lee also removed several generals such as John Magruder and Benjamin Huger who had performed poorly during the Seven Days Battles.[68]","input":"Who won the seven day battle civil war?"},{"output":"leone","context":"The leone is the currency of Sierra Leone.

Originally called Shillings, the unit name \\"Leone\\" was finally decided upon. After considering (and subsequently rejecting) several new designs, including a particularly attractive multi-coloured design, notes were issued in the 1, 2 and 5 Leone denominations. These officially replaced notes of the British West African pound at a two leone to one pound exchange ratio. 50 cents notes were introduced in 1979, followed by 10 leones in 1980 and 20 leones notes in 1982. Throughout this period the value of the currency was fixed and remained relatively stable despite inherent economic problems.\\r\\n100 leones notes were introduced in 1988, followed by 500 leones in 1991, 1000 and 5000 leones in 1993, 2000 leones in the year 2000 and 10,000 Leone in 2004.\\r\\nThe original series of notes (1964-1974) depicted the famous 300 year old Cottonwood Tree and Court building in central Freetown. The reverses showed Diamond Mining (1 Leone), a Village market scene (2 Leones) and the Dockside in Freetown (5 Leones). Subsequent issues (1974-1991) depicted the head of state during the time of issue. The first series depicting Sir Milton Margai and later issues depicting either Siaka and Momoh. This practice ended with the ascension of the NPRC regime and has remained so despite the return to civilian government.\\r\\nPrior to June 2010, bank notes in circulation were 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 and 10,000 leones. 10,000 leones notes were in circulation for less than ten years and were infrequently encountered. This meant that most transactions took place in bundles of 5000 leones notes.\\r\\nIn June 2010, the Bank of Sierra Leone issued new notes which were slightly smaller in size than the earlier series and intended to be more secure and durable. The new bank notes are: Le10,000, Le5,000, Le2,000 and Le1,000.[2] Coins are still used, but because of their low value are less common.\\r\\nBecause of inflation, a 20,000 leone banknote has been suggested[by whom?]. As of May 20th, 2017, 20,000 leones are equivalent to about $2.68 USD.[3]\\r\\nSpecimen notes are issued to banks to familiarize the local inhabitants with any currency changes. These are issued by Thomas De La Rue of the UK.","input":"What is the currency used in sierra leone?"},{"output":"Gordon Brown","context":"The signing of the Treaty of Lisbon took place in Lisbon, Portugal, on 13 December 2007. The Government of Portugal, by virtue of holding Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the time, arranged a ceremony inside the 15th century Jer܇nimos Monastery, the same place Portugal's treaty of accession to the European Union (EU) had been signed in 1985.[1] Representatives from the 27 EU member states were present, and signed the Treaty as plenipotentiaries, marking the end of negotiations that began in 2001. In addition, for the first time an EU treaty was also signed by the presidents of the three main EU institutions. After the main ceremony, the heads of state and government took a ride on a decorated Lisbon tram together, symbolising the brotherhood of European countries on the path of European integration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diplomacy and brokering that lead to the political deal contained in the Treaty of Lisbon (then referred to as the 'Reform Treaty') was largely an achievement by the German presidency of the Council of the European Union, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel in the first half of 2007. At the meeting of the European Council on 18 and 19 October 2007, Portugal, which succeeded Germany as holder of the Presidency, did however insist that the Treaty be signed in Lisbon, the Portuguese capital. This request was granted, and the Treaty was thus to be called the Treaty of Lisbon, in line with the tradition of naming European Union treaties. The Portuguese presidency was appointed to the job of organising a programme and a ceremony for the signing of the treaty in late 2007, later specified to 13 December.[2]\\r\\nAt 10:00 the plenipotentiaries from the 27 member states, as well as the presidents of the three main EU institutions, started arriving outside the Jer܇nimos Monastery with their motorcades. They were in turn met with welcome greetings by Portuguese Prime Minister Jos S܇crates and Foreign Minister Luis Amado. When all participants and the audience were seated inside the main courtyard of the monastery (with a temporary roof for the occasion), a choir of Portuguese children, accompanied by a piano, performed the original German-language version of the European anthem, the Ludwig van Beethoven's Ode to Joy. After this interlude, the President of the European Commission, Jos Manuel Barroso; the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert P?ttering and the Prime Minister of Portugal (in the role of President of the European Council), Jos S܇crates, respectively, held speeches stressing the historic significance of the day. Around noon the main signing ceremony began, with representatives from the 27 member states signing the treaty in the alphabetic order. Afterwards, renowned Portuguese folk artist Dulce Pontes performed a musical piece in the country's traditional Fado genre. The programme at Jer܇nimos Monastery ended with a traditional 'family photo' of the leaders outside the South Gate of the historical building.\\r\\nRepresentatives from the member states signed the treaty in the following order:\\r\\n1. ?Belgium:\\r\\nPrime minister Guy Verhofstadt\\r\\nForeign minister Karel De Gucht\\r\\n2. ?Bulgaria:\\r\\nPrime minister Sergei Stanishev\\r\\nDept.

Instead, he signed the document at a lunch for heads of state and government later the same day. A requirement to appear before a committee of British MPs was cited as the reason for his absence.[3] This brought criticism from opposition parties. The Conservatives claimed it made him appear gutless and referred to it as a \\"stunt which proved Brown was \\"not very good at international diplomacy\\". The Liberal Democrats claimed it raised \\"serious questions\\" and Chris Huhne said showed \\"inept and peevish behaviour that leaves Gordon Brown's reputation for honest dealing with our EU partners hanging by a thread\\".[4] Parts of British media also criticised Brown for this, suggesting he did it because he was ashamed to sign the Treaty,[5] with Nick Robinson, BBC Political Editor, claiming that Brown was capable of attending the signing but instead chose not to.[6]\\r\\nAfter the group photo outside the monastery, the leaders took a ride on one of Lisbon electric trams together. This unusual way of transporting heads of state and government was described as a symbol of the fraternity of European countries on the path of European integration. The trip ended at the National Coach Museum of Portugal, wherein a festive lunch was held amid a historical collection of royal carriages. The delay of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown resulted with him arriving at the museum and signing the Treaty there.[7]\\r\\nProtestors were present in Lisbon when the treaty was signed. For instance the British pressure group I Want a Referendum staged a demonstration against the treaty being ratified in the United Kingdom by means of approval only by the British Parliament, without holding an additional referendum.[8]\\r\\nThe Treaty of Amsterdam established Brussels as the seat of all normal European Council meetings and as the signing coincided with one of those meetings, there was disagreement as to the venue. Belgium, keen not to set any precedent of holding mandatory meetings outside of Brussels against the treaty, wanted the meeting in Brussels whereas the Portuguese EU presidency wanted it in Lisbon in order to call the treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon.\\r\\nThe result was to sign the treaty in Lisbon, then continue the meeting in Brussels which became an open invitation for the media to attack the leaders for taking 27 separate unnecessary plane journeys, undermining the EU's environmental standing just as it sought to get international backing behind a post-Kyoto agreement. In the end, some leaders (such as the three Benelux leaders) plane pooled.[9]\\r\\nThe television coverage of the ceremony was produced by Rdio e Televis?o de Portugal, the public broadcaster of Portugal.[10] The ceremony was broadcast live on for instance the website of the Portuguese presidency as well as on international television news networks, including Euronews.[10]","input":"Which british prime minister signed the lisbon treaty?"},{"output":"a play house museum, consisting largely of repurposed architectural and industrial objects, housed in the former International Shoe building in the Washington Avenue Loft District of St. Louis, Missouri, United States","context":"City Museum is a play house museum, consisting largely of repurposed architectural and industrial objects, housed in the former International Shoe building in the Washington Avenue Loft District of St. Louis, Missouri, United States.\\r\\nOpened in 1997, the museum attracted more than 700,000 visitors in 2010.[1]\\r\\nThe City Museum has been named one of the \\"great public spaces\\" by the Project for Public Spaces,[2] and has won other local and international awards as a must-see destination.[citation needed] It has been described as \\"a wild, singular vision of an oddball artistic mind\\" and compared to the similarly individualistic Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCity Museum was founded by artist Bob Cassilly and his then-wife Gail Cassilly. The museum's building was once an International Shoe Company factory and warehouse but was mostly vacant when the Cassillys bought it in 1993. Construction began in January 1995.\\r\\nThe City Museum opened to the public on October 25, 1997. Within two years, it was drawing 300,000 visitors a year.[4]\\r\\nThe museum has since expanded, adding new exhibits such as MonstroCity in 2002, Enchanted Caves and Shoe Shaft in 2003, and World Aquarium in 2004.[5]\\r\\nCassilly remained the museum's artistic director until his death in 2011.[5]\\r\\nA circus ring on the third floor offers daily live acts. The City Museum also houses The Shoelace Factory, whose antique braiding machines makes colorful shoelaces for sale. The Museum has hosted concerts.\\r\\nThe building's fifth floor houses apartments, dubbed the Lofts at City Museum, which range in size from 1,300 to more than 2,800 square feet (260?m2).[6]\\r\\nThe original part of the museum, the first floor is home to a life-size Bowhead Whale that guests can walk through and view a large fish tank from the mezzanine or the always popular \\"Puking Pig.\\" Also on the first floor, are a number of tunnels that run across the ceiling, hiding above a sea of fiberglass insulation cut to give the impression of icicles. To get into these, one can climb up a Slinky, which is an old refrigerating coil (donated by Anheuser-Busch), or through a tree house which leads into a giant hollowed out tree that leads to a cabin on the other side of the floor. The floor itself is covered with the largest continuous mosaic piece in the US, which then morph their way up columns, consuming every section of this floor. In one area is a tunnel known as the \\"Underground Whaleway\\" which runs beneath the floor and into the \\"Original Caves.\\"\\r\\nOne of the museum's most popular attractions, the Enchanted Caves and Shoe Shafts run through the center of the Museum, and go all the way to the 10th floor. Opened in 2003, the Caves are an elaborate cave system hand-sculpted by Bob Cassilly and his crew. From every direction, a different creature is staring back. Since 2007, the Caves have also held a 1924 Wurlitzer Pipe Organ from the Rivoli Theater in New York City.\\r\\nThe Shoe Shafts were developed from structures built for the International Shoe distribution operation. To get the shoes from various floors to the loading dock, staff would place the shoes on spiral shafts. The Shafts opened in 2003 with one three-story spiral slide, and five years later added a ten-story slide that starts at the roof and goes down to the Caves' entrance. There is also a five-story slide.\\r\\nThe Mezzanine contains the Museum's food court and a number of sections that are also tied into the first floor.\\r\\nThe Vault Room contains two 3,000-pound vault doors built in mid-19th-century St. Louis and installed in a bank in Chicago, Illinois. The room also has a marble bar and about 1,000 safety deposit boxes.\\r\\nThe middle of the room highlights the \\"hamster wheel\\", a piece of machinery donated by McDonnell Douglas, which used it to make fuselages for small airplanes.\\r\\nOff to the side of the Vault Room and leading to the Enchanted Caves is St. George's Chamber, which holds vintage opera posters and a statue of St. George from Saint George's Catholic Church in Chicago.\\r\\nThe Shoelace Factory has shoelace machines from the 1890s. Visitors can order custom-made laces.\\r\\nThe World Aquarium was an animal exhibition and rehabilitation center. It housed a variety of animals such as sharks, rays, sea turtles, parrots, tortoises, terrapins, otters, snakes, alligators and sloths as well as the expected freshwater and saltwater fish. The World Aquarium had a shark tank with a glass tunnel running through it, big enough to crawl through, but too small to walk. The aquarium also had stingray petting and allowed stingray feeding for a fee at certain times. The World Aquarium portion of the City Museum ceased operations on September 7, 2015.[7]\\r\\nThe 3rd Floor is home to a number of attractions. In one area is Skate Park, which is a collection of skateboard ramps, without the skateboards, in place having rope swings tied in front of the ramps. There are ramps you can run up and pull your self over like the warped wall from the TV show Ninja Warrior, except this wall is only 10 feet tall. There is also the Everyday Circus, a circus school with students from 6 to 80+.[citation needed] The Everyday Circus performs daily at the museum and does private parties. Just around the corner from the Circus, is Art City where guests can try their hand at a number of different art techniques, as well as Toddler Town; A section dedicated only to those 6 and under. Beatnik Bob's is directly across from the Circus, which features the \\"World's Largest Underwear\\", a collection of vintage video/pinball games, and a concessions stand, bar and coffee shop. Right outside Beatnik's is a 1/8 scale model of an Alco Train that children who are 48 inches high and under can ride around the tracks. Past Architectural Hall, the Museum's largest rental space, is the Architectural Museum. Located here is the cross from the \\"Exorcist,\\" a collection of antique door knobs, and the Museum's current exhibit of Elmslie and Sullivan. Off Architectural Hall, the Museum recently started to add a Natural History Section. On display are a number of insects and taxidermy items. Finally, on the 3rd Floor, the entrance to the three story slide that leads back to the first floor.\\r\\nThe 3rd Floor is also home to a small number of hauntings. There have been reports of a piano playing on its own and small children being seen near the Alco Train and various other people talking or crying.[8]\\r\\nIn 2012, City Museum took over the space on the 4th floor that once was the Bale Out. As of 2013, fresh donuts are served here while long-term plans are contemplated.\\r\\nThe roof has a small old-fashioned Ferris wheel. It also has a slide that goes under a small pond. The pond has stepping stones that go from one side to the other. The roof also has a school bus that had actually worked once, extending past the edge of the building. Visitors can walk in the school bus and open the door from the driver's seat. Also found on the roof are a giant rope swing contained in a free-standing aluminum dome underneath the roof's centerpiece; a giant metal praying mantis. It is possible to climb a series of enclosed metal ladders inside the dome to an exit at the top.\\r\\nLocated in front of the building, MonstroCity features two Sabreliner 40 aircraft fuselages suspended high in the air, a fire engine, a castle turret, a 25-foot (7.6?m) cupola, four-foot-wide Slinkies that can be crawled through, one very high that leads to a slide, and two ball pits, one for young children and one for older ones, each pit being filled with large, rubber dodge balls.[9]\\r\\nThe Cabin Inn is an early-19th-century log cabin located beneath MonstroCity.

The executive producers for the first production season were Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was originally set to debut in autumn 1989 with the episode \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", which was meant to introduce the main characters;[2] during the first screening of the episode, the producers discovered that the animation was so appalling that 70% of the episode needed to be redone.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe producers considered aborting the series if the next episode turned out as bad, but it only suffered from easily fixable problems. The producers convinced Fox to move the debut to December 17, and aired \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" as the first episode of the series.[2] The first season won one Emmy Award, and received four additional nominations.[4] The DVD boxset was released on September 25, 2001 in Region 1 and September 24, 2001 in both Region 2 and Region 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Simpsons creator Matt Groening conceived the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office. Brooks, the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show, wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches. He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series. When Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987.[6] Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. The animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included what is now the Klasky Csupo animation house. During the years of producing the shorts, everything was created in-house. Due to the increased workload of the full-length episodes, production was subcontracted to South Korean animation studio AKOM.[8] While character and background layout is done by the domestic studio, tweening, coloring, and filming are done by the overseas studio.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Simpsons was co-developed by Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon, a writer-producer with whom Brooks had worked on previous projects. Groening and Simon, however, did not get along[9] and were often in conflict over the show;[10] Groening once described their relationship as \\"very contentious\\".[11] Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called \\"the mainstream trash\\" that they were watching.[12] Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.[13] Fox was nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audience's attention for the duration of the episode.[2] They proposed doing three seven-minute shorts per episode and four specials until the audience adjusted,[2] but in the end, the producers gambled by asking Fox for 13 full-length episodes.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon assembled and led the initial team of writers, consisting of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky.[15][16] Simon has been credited as \\"developing [the show's] sensibility\\".[17] Ken Levine says he \\"brought a level of honesty to the characters\\" and made them \\"three-dimensional\\", adding that Simon's \\"comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters.\\"[17] Simon saw The Simpsons as a chance to solve \\"what [he] didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows [he had] worked on...[he] wanted all the actors in a room together, not reading their lines separated from each other. The Simpsons would have been a great radio show. If you just listen to the sound track, it works.\\"[17] The music for all 13 episodes was composed by former Oingo Boingo member Richard Gibbs,[18] who would depart the show at the end of the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was originally set to debut in the fall of 1989 with the episode \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", which was meant to introduce the main characters.[2] A debacle erupted when the episode \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", the first to return from animation in Korea, was screened in front of the production staff at the Gracie Films bungalow.[2] The executive producer and developer James L. Brooks' initial reaction to the animation was \\"This is shit.\\"[2] After that reaction the room almost cleared.[2] A heated argument ensued between Brooks and Klasky-Csupo animation studio head Gbor Csup܇, who denied that there was anything wrong with the animation and suggested that the real problem was the quality of the show's writing.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with the animation from the producers' point-of-view was that it did not exhibit a distinct style envisioned for the show. At the time there were only a few choices for animation style. Usually, they would either follow the style of Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna-Barbera. Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a universe that was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber.[2] The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. One example with the early animation being cartoonish was that the doors behaved liked rubber when slammed. The style of Hanna-Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, during the first screening of the episode, the producers discovered that the animation was so appalling that 70% of the episode needed to be redone.[3] The producers considered aborting the series if the next episode (\\"Bart the Genius\\") turned out as bad, but it only suffered from a few, easily fixable problems. The producers convinced Fox to move the debut to December 17, and aired \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" as the first episode of the series.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe half hour series premiere debuted on December 17, 1989 with \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" a Christmas special. The next episode \\"Bart the Genius\\" was the first to feature the series' full title sequence, including the chalkboard gag and couch gag. Matt Groening developed the lengthy sequence in order to cut down on the animation necessary for each episode, but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week.[20] Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time.[20] As the finished episodes became longer, the production team were reluctant to cut the stories in order to allow for the long title sequence, so shorter versions of it were developed.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some of the episodes the characters act completely differently to how they do in later seasons; Lisa, for example, is undisciplined and short-tempered, while Homer is the voice of reason; these roles are reversed in later episodes.[22] Mr. Burns was voiced by Christopher Collins in \\"Homer's Odyssey\\". Originally, the character was influenced by Ronald Reagan, a concept which was later dropped.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first episode featured many new characters such as Seymour Skinner, Milhouse Van Houten, Sherri and Terri, Moe Szyslak, Mr. Burns, Barney Gumble, Patty and Selma, Ned and Todd Flanders, Santa's Little Helper, Snowball II, Dewey Largo, and Lewis.[23] Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers can be heard over the speaker at the power plant, but he is not seen.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following episodes in the season saw the introduction of several new recurring characters, including Martin Prince, Richard, Edna Krabappel, Dr. J Loren Pryor,[24] Waylon Smithers, Otto Mann, Chief Wiggum, Jasper Beardley, Sam & Larry, Mr. & Mrs. Winfield, Sherri and Terri,[25] Dr. Marvin Monroe, Eddie and Lou,[26] Nelson Muntz, Herman,[27] Bleeding Gums Murphy, Jacqueline Bouvier,[28] Sideshow Bob, Reverend Timothy Lovejoy, Krusty the Clown, Jimbo Jones, Kearney Zzyzwicz, Dolphin \\"Dolph\\" Starbeam, Ms. Albright, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon,[29] Lenny and Carl, Kent Brockman and Agnes Skinner.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Simpsons first season was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows.[31] It won one Emmy Award, and received four additional nominations. Although television shows are limited to one episode a category, \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" was considered a separate special, and nominated alongside fellow episode \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\" for Outstanding Animated Program; \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\" won the award. \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" was also nominated for \\"Outstanding Editing in a Miniseries or Special\\", while \\"The Call of the Simpsons\\" was nominated for \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special\\". The main theme song, composed by Danny Elfman, was nominated for \\"Outstanding Achievement in Main Title Theme Music\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Metacritic, a site which uses a weighted mean score, the season scored a 79/100 from six critics, translating to \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" However, the show was controversial from its beginning. The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents to characterize him as a poor role model for children.[32][33] Several US public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts, such as one featuring Bart and the caption \\"Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')\\".[34] Despite the ban, The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated US$2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nBart has trouble on an intelligence test and sneakily switches tests with Martin Prince, the class genius. After the results are tabulated, the school psychiatrist labels Bart a genius and sends him to the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children. Homer starts treating Bart with respect, but Bart immediately feels out of place among his new classmates and is alienated from his old peers. He confesses that he cheated on the test and is subsequently sent back to Springfield Elementary School.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nBart becomes friends with Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney, a group of local troublemakers. Trying to impress them, Bart decides to cut off and steal the head of the statue of Jebediah Springfield. The next day, the entire town grieves for the vandalized statue and Bart discovers that his new friends want to attack the vandal. Feeling remorse, Bart confesses to his family and Homer and Bart take the head back to the statue after passing through the furious people.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal Skinner finally becomes fed up with Bart's pranks and proposes that Bart be sent to France as part of the student exchange program. The family agrees and Bart is sent to the \\"beautiful\\" Chateau Maison, which is actually a dilapidated farmhouse on a neglected vineyard. Bart is treated like a slave by two unscrupulous winemakers, Csar and Ugolin, who eventually feed him wine tainted with antifreeze. Meanwhile, an Albanian boy named Adil starts to live with the Simpsons who, unbeknownst to Homer, is a spy sent by his country to obtain nuclear blueprints. Back in France, Bart learns French and reports the winemakers' crimes to the authorities.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile buying ice cream at the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer witnesses a robbery perpetrated by a man believed to be Krusty the Clown, host of \\"Krusty the Clown Show\\", Bart's favorite program. Krusty is sent to jail and his show is taken over by his assistant, Sideshow Bob. Bart is certain that Krusty is innocent, and gathers evidence to support his claim, which he takes to \\"Krusty's bestest friend\\", Sideshow Bob. Bart realizes that the robbery was actually committed by Bob, who was trying to frame Krusty. Bob is arrested and Krusty thanks Bart for saving him.Guest star: Kelsey Grammer.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DVD boxset for season one was released by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada in September 2001, eleven years after it had completed broadcast on television. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes, Animatics, and commentaries for every episode.

They were invited a third time in 2009 and again in 2012 and 2015. Under the leadership of Erik Julliard, the band is also responsible for the founding of the Basel Tattoo, a military tattoo show similar to the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, now held annually in Basel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTop Secret has its roots in the rich drumming traditions of the band's home city, Basel, Switzerland, which is known for its annual carnival called Fasnacht. The city is said to have over 3,000 active drummers at any one time.

A Trommelk?nig (Drummer King) competition is also held every year by the city's Fasnacht Committee.\\r\\nBasel drumming style is militaristic, derived from the military drumming drills of Swiss soldiers dating back to the Middle Ages. Top Secret in many ways adheres to the military nature of Basel drumming, but differs in many respects. Its drummers play at a much faster rate. Also, while traditional Basel drumming is somber and favors traditional marching tunes (accompanied by fifes during the Fasnacht), Top Secret's drumming style is upbeat and playful. Segments of their routines feature a rhumba, a drummer's duel, drumstick juggling, exploding flagpoles, and other crowd-pleasing details.

The film is directed by Patty Jenkins, with a screenplay by Allan Heinberg, from a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder, and Jason Fuchs, and stars Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Connie Nielsen, and Elena Anaya. Wonder Woman is the second live action theatrical film featuring the titular character, following her debut in 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[5] Jenkins's role as director makes her the first female director of a live-action, theatrically released comic book superhero film.[6] The film tells the story of Princess Diana, who grows up on the Amazon island of Themyscira. After American pilot Steve Trevor crashes offshore of the island and is rescued by her, he tells the Amazons about the ongoing World War. Diana then leaves her home in order to end the conflict.\\r\\nWhile development for the film began in 1996, Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before wrapping up on May 9, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of the birth of the creator, William Moulton Marston. Additional filming took place in November 2016.\\r\\nWonder Woman premiered in Shanghai on May 15, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 2, 2017, in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D. It received largely positive reviews from critics, being praised for the direction, performances, action sequences, and musical score.[7] The film set numerous box office records;[8] it is the fifth-highest-grossing superhero film domestically and 20th-highest-grossing film in the United States. It grossed over $821?million worldwide, making it the eighth highest-grossing film of 2017. It also helped the DCEU to push past $3?billion at the worldwide box office, making it the fourteenth-highest-grossing film franchise of all time. As of October 2017, the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes has listed the movie as #1 on its list of the \\"50 Best Superhero Movies of All Time\\",[9] and the American Film Institute selected it as one of the top 10 Movies of the Year.[10] A sequel is set to be released on November 1, 2019.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn present-day Paris, Diana Prince receives a photographic plate of herself and four men taken during World War I, prompting her to recall her past. Daughter of Queen Hippolyta, Diana was raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, home to the Amazonian warrior women created by Zeus to protect mankind. Hippolyta shares the Amazonian history with Diana, including how Ares, Zeus's son, became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat (thus dying in the process). Zeus left the Amazons the island and a weapon, the \\"Godkiller\\", to prepare them for Ares' return.\\r\\nInitially forbidding Diana to train as a warrior, Hippolyta allows her sister Antiope to train Diana, only more rigorously than any other warrior. In 1918, Diana, now a young woman, rescues American pilot Captain Steve Trevor when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by a German ship pursuing Trevor. The Amazons kill the crew, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia, and reveals that a war is consuming the outside world, and that he is an Allied spy. He has stolen a notebook of the chief chemist Isabel Maru, who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of mustard gas, under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the \\"Godkiller\\" sword, the lasso, and her armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and destroy Ares for good.\\r\\nIn London, they deliver Maru's notebook to the Supreme War Council, where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an armistice with Germany. Diana translates Maru's notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the Western Front. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Sir Patrick, recruits spy Sameer, marksman Charlie, and smuggler Chief to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in Belgium. Diana goes alone through No Man's Land and captures the enemy trench, allowing the Allied forces to help her liberate the village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates, while Diana and Steve grow closer romantically.\\r\\nThe team learns a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, while Diana intends to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills Ludendorff, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.\\r\\nSir Patrick appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in the process, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the \\"Godkiller\\" sword, he destroys it, then reveals Diana to be the \\"Godkiller\\", as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the gas to a safe altitude and detonates it, sacrificing himself in the process. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares' lightning into him, killing him. Later, the team celebrates the end of the war. In the present day, Diana sends an email to Bruce Wayne thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve and reaffirms her new mission to fight and give on the world's behalf.\\r\\nAdditionally, Mayling Ng, Florence Kasumba, Madeleine Vall Beijner, Hayley Jane Warnes and Ann Wolfe portray Orana, Acantha, Egeria, Aella and Artemis, respectively, all of whom are Amazons.[61][62][63][64] James Cosmo appears as Field Marshal Haig, Steffan Rhodri appears as Colonel Darnell, and Dutch model Doutzen Kroes portrays the Amazon Venelia.[63] Samantha Jo was cast as the Amazonian Euboea, and previously played the Kryptonian, Car-Vex, in Man of Steel.[65] Zack Snyder also makes a brief cameo appearance in the film as an unnamed soldier.[66]\\r\\nDevelopment for a live action Wonder Woman feature film began in 1996, with Ivan Reitman attached as producer and possible director.[67] In 1999 the project became attached to Jon Cohen, who adapted Wonder Woman for producer Joel Silver, with the hope that Sandra Bullock would star.[68] By 2001, Todd Alcott was hired to write the screenplay, with Silver Pictures backing the project.[69] At that time, performers such as Mariah Carey and Catherine Zeta-Jones were also rumored to be possible candidates for the role of Wonder Woman.[70] Leonard Goldberg, however, focused on Bullock[71] who said that she was approached for the role. In addition, wrestler Chyna also expressed interest. Lucy Lawless, the star of Xena: Warrior Princess, was also under consideration, though she stated that she would have been more interested if Wonder Woman was portrayed as a \\"flawed hero\\".[72] The screenplay went through various drafts written by Alcott, Cohen, Becky Johnston, and Philip Levens,[73] and by August 2003, Levens had been replaced by screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis.[74]\\r\\nIn March 2005, Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures announced that Joss Whedon would write and direct the film,[75] with a reported salary was of $2 to $3?million.[76] Since Whedon was directing Serenity at the time, and required time to research Wonder Woman's background, he did not begin the screenplay until late 2005.[77][78][79] Early drafts of his screenplay included Steve Trevor as the narrator, a fierce battle between Diana and her mother over Trevor's welfare, and after leaving Themyscira, his need to frequently rescue a Diana rendered helpless by the modern world.[80] Whedon was not able to complete a final version of his screenplay however, and left the project in 2007.[81][82]\\r\\nAlthough Whedon stated in May 2005 that he would not cast the part of Wonder Woman until he finished the script,[83] actors such as Kate Beckinsale were linked to the part.[84] In 2010 however, Whedon admitted that he did have an actress in mind for the part, stating that \\"Wonder Woman was basically Angelina Jolie.\\"[80][85] A few years later in May 2017, Indie Ground Films leaked a version of Whedon's script in-progress online.[86] Some reacted negatively to it on social media in June 2017, shortly after the release of Patty Jenkins' version of the film.[87][88][89][90][91] When asked about this response to his script, Jenkins said in a June 2017 interview that she has not read it and that Whedon is \\"in the DC universe now, and I don't think there's any reason to go there [...] It was what it was. I'm lucky that I'm the person who got to do it. But I don't see what would be beneficial about comparing what he would've done versus what I would have done.\\"[92][93]\\r\\nA day before Whedon's departure from Wonder Woman, Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures purchased a spec script for the film written by Matthew Jennison and Brent Strickland. Set during World War II, the script impressed executives at Silver Pictures.[82] However, Silver stated that he had purchased the script because he did not want the rights reverting; while stating the script had good ideas, Silver did not want the film to be a period piece.[94] By April 2008, Silver hired Jennison and Strickland to write a new script set in contemporary times that would not depict Wonder Woman's origin, but explore Paradise Island's history.[95] In November 2008, Beyonc met with representatives from DC Comics and Warner Bros., to discuss her interest in portraying Wonder Woman.[96]\\r\\nIn 2010, Warner Bros. stated that a film was in development, along with films based on DC Comics superheroes the Flash and Aquaman.[97] Both Wonder Woman and Aquaman were still under consideration for solo film subjects as of June 2013.[98] DC Chief Diane Nelson said Wonder Woman \\"has been, since I started, one of the top three priorities for DC and for Warner Bros. We are still trying right now, but she's tricky.\\"[99] On October 5, 2013, WB chairman Kevin Tsujihara said he wanted to get Wonder Woman in a film or on TV.[100] Shortly afterward, Paul Feig said he had pitched the studio an idea for Wonder Woman as an action-comedy film.[101][102] The studio then began to search for female directors to direct the film.[103] While Michelle MacLaren was the studio's initial choice to direct (and while she initially indicated interest),[104][105][106] she eventually left the project due to creative differences.[107]\\r\\nIn 2015, Patty Jenkins accepted an offer to direct Wonder Woman,[108] based on a screenplay by Allan Heinberg and a story co-written by Heinberg, Zack Snyder, Geoff Johns and Jason Fuchs.[109] Of this version, Gadot stated that,\\r\\nfor a long time, people didn't know how to approach the story. When Patty and I had our creative conversations about the character, we realized that Diana can still be a normal woman, one with very high values, but still a woman. She can be sensitive. She is smart and independent and emotional. She can be confused. She can lose her confidence. She can have confidence. She is everything. She has a human heart.[5]\\r\\nThis version was conceived of as a prequel to the first live-action, theatrical appearance of Wonder Woman, in the 2016 film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,[110] placing Wonder Woman in the 1910s and World War I (a decision which differs from her comic book origins as a supporter of the Allies during World War II).[111] As for story development, Jenkins credits the stories by the character's creator William Moulton Marston in the 1940s and George Perez's seminal stories in the 1980s in which he modernized the character.[112] In addition, it follows some aspects of DC Comics' origin changes in The New 52 reboot, where Diana is the daughter of Zeus.[12][113] Jenkins cited Richard Donner's Superman as an inspiration.[114]\\r\\nIn late 2013, Zack Snyder cast Gal Gadot in the role of Wonder Woman for the 2016 film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice over lodie Yung and Olga Kurylenko.[116][117][118][119] Some fans initially reacted to this choice by criticizing Gadot's appearance.[120] Snyder would later comment on his decision to cast Gadot, stating that he tested a \\"bunch of actresses, as you can imagine. But the thing with Gal is that she's strong, she's beautiful, and she's a kind person, which is interesting, but fierce at the same time. It's that combination of being fierce but kind at the same time that we were looking for.[121] Gadot described Diana as having \\"the heart of a human so she can be emotional, she's curious, she's compassionate, she loves people. And then she has the powers of a goddess. She's all for good, she fights for good.\\"[5] She also said that Diana has \\"many strengths and powers, but at the end of the day she's a woman with a lot of emotional intelligence\\".[122] As to how her character is different from her appearance in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Gadot said \\"We go back 100 years to when she's more naive\\", further explaining, \\"She's this young idealist. She's pure. Very different to the experienced, super-confident, grown-up woman you've seen\\".[123] Gadot underwent a diet and training regimen, practiced different martial arts and gained 17 pounds of muscle for the role.[124][125] Gadot was previously offered a different role (as a villain) in Man of Steel, which she declined because she was pregnant at the time; this allowed her to later be cast as Wonder Woman in the film's follow-up.[126] Gadot signed a three-picture deal.[118] She was only paid a base salary of $300,000 for the film itself.[127]\\r\\nChris Pine was cast as Steve Trevor,[21][128] a character he described as a \\"rogue-ish, cynical realist who's seen the awful brutish nature of modern civilization\\" and added that he is a \\"worldly guy, a charming guy\\".[129] He signed a multi-picture deal.[21] Lucy Davis' performance as Etta Candy is the first live-action cinematic portrayal of the character.[130] As well, Elena Anaya's performance as Doctor Poison is the cinematic debut of that character. Nicole Kidman was in negotiations for the role of Queen Hippolyta, but was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts with Big Little Lies.[131][132]\\r\\nProduction began on November 21, 2015,[133][134] under the working title Nightingale.[135][136] Among the film sets were Lower Halstow, Kent,[137] Australia House,[138] and the Sassi di Matera,[139] Castel del Monte[139] and Camerota[140] in Southern Italy. Matthew Jensen was the director of photography,[141] filming in the United Kingdom, France and Italy.[142] Production in London ended on March 13, 2016.[143] On March 20, 2016, filming was underway in Italy. In late April, filming took place at a museum in France, where a Wayne Enterprises truck was spotted alongside Gadot.[144] Production ended on May 9, 2016.[145] Patty Jenkins and director of photography Matt Jensen revealed that the film's look was inspired by painter John Singer Sargent.[146] Reshoots took place in November 2016, while Gadot was five months pregnant. A green cloth was placed over her stomach to edit out her pregnancy during post-production.[147]\\r\\nTo find the perfect location to shoot the Amazon island of Themyscira, the birthplace of Wonder Woman herself, the film's producers searched all over the world, finally settling on the Amalfi Coast: a stretch of coastline on the Tyrrhenian Sea, located in the Province of Salerno in Southern Italy.[148] It was chosen because most beaches in the world that sit below big cliffs disappear beneath the tide for part of every day. Production designer Aline Bonetto and her location manager Charles Somers considered 47 countries and visited several of them before they found what they were looking for. Bonetto explained that, \\"Italy had beautiful weather, a beautiful blue-green sea, not too much tide, not too much wave. Our effects team added some cliffs in post-production, and it was the perfect way to go\\".[149]\\r\\nThe estuary at Lower Halstow in Kent, featured in the scenes in which Princess Diana arrives in the Belgian creek to make her way to the warfront.[150]\\r\\nBill Westenhofer served as the visual effects supervisor for the film[151] and Martin Walsh served as editor.[141]\\r\\nOn November 3, 2016, Rupert Gregson-Williams was hired to write and compose the film's music.[152] He was joined by Evan Jolly, Tom Howe,[153] Paul Mounsey,[154] and Andrew Kawczynski,[155] who provided additional music. The soundtrack was released on CD, digital, and vinyl the same day as the film.[156] Australian musician Sia sang a song for the film, titled \\"To Be Human\\", featuring English musician Labrinth. Written by Florence Welch and Rick Nowels, the track is also featured on the soundtrack.[157]\\r\\nAdditional music featured in the film are: \\"Another Little Drink Wouldn't Do Us Any Harm\\" by Clifford Grey and Nat Ayer and performed by Edgar Trevor and Cecil Cooper; \\"Molly O'Morgan\\" written by Fred Godfrey and Will Letters and performed by Ella Retford; \\"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\\" written by Jack Judge and Harry Williams; \\"Sous les ponts de Paris\\" written by Jean Rodor and Vincent Scotto and performed by Lucienne Delyle; \\"I'll Walk Beside You\\" written by Edward Lockton and Alan Murray and performed by Ewen Bremner; \\"Green Grow the Rushes, O\\" written by Robert Burns and performed by Ewen Bremner; and \\"Schatzwalzer Op. 4\\" written by Johann Strauss II and performed by the Berlin String Quartet.[158] Also features samples from the movie's soundtrack \\"Is She with You\\" from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice composed by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL.\\r\\nWonder Woman had its world premiere on May 15, 2017 in Shanghai. It premiered on May 25, 2017 in Los Angeles.[159] The film's London premiere, which was scheduled to take place on May 31 at the Odeon Leicester Square, was cancelled due to the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.[160] The film had its Latin America premiere in Mexico City on May 27. It was released in most of the world, including in IMAX,[161] on June 2, 2017, after originally being scheduled for June 23.[162][163] Belgium, Singapore and South Korea received the film first, with May 31 openings.[164][165][166] On April 17, it was announced that Wonder Woman would be released in China on June 2, the same day as its North American release.[167]\\r\\nThe success of the superhero television series Supergirl informed the marketing and promotion strategy used for Wonder Woman.[168] According to Time Warner chief marketing officer Kristen O'Hara, they wanted to approach the Wonder Woman marketing campaign in a light manner, similar to how they did with Supergirl. O'Hara elaborated that the modest campaign route they took for Supergirl aided in establishing a large central fanbase among women well in advance of the series, which reportedly generated 5 million female superhero fans in one week.[168] They were then able to model over time, and grow that audience leading up to the 15-months-later release of Wonder Woman.[168] Though neither the film nor the series are aimed exclusively at women, the latter's campaign gave them their first opportunity to begin collecting data about female superhero fans.[168] In May 2017, a promo for Wonder Woman was released during the season finale of Supergirl, featuring a remix of the song \\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\" and Supergirl (Melissa Benoist) wearing Wonder Woman's boots.[169] The promo included an appearance by Lynda Carter, star of the 1970s Wonder Woman, who plays the American president on Supergirl.[169]\\r\\nThe costs for television advertisements for Wonder Woman are higher in comparison to that of previous DCEU film Suicide Squad. Warner Bros. has spent over $3?million on advertisements for Wonder Woman, whereas they spent $2.6?million on advertisements for Suicide Squad.[170] Ticket selling site Fandango reported that Wonder Woman rounded the final leg of its marketing campaign as the most anticipated blockbuster of summer 2017, according to a poll conducted by 10,000 voters, the biggest survey in company history.[171] Separately, Fandango also found that 92% of people surveyed said that they are looking forward to seeing a film that features a standalone woman superhero, and 87% wished Hollywood would make more women-led superhero films.[172] In May 2017, NASCAR driver Danica Patrick drove her No. 10 car with a Wonder Woman paint scheme at the Go Bowling 400 in Kansas and at the Monster Energy Open in Charlotte.[173]\\r\\nWonder Woman was released on Digital HD on August 29, 2017 and on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, 4K Ultra-HD Blu-ray and DVD on September 19, 2017.[174] The film debuted at the top spot of both the NPD VideoScan overall disc sales chart and the Blu-ray Disc sales chart.[175]\\r\\nOn May 31, Wonder Woman was banned in Lebanon after the Campaign to Boycott Supporters of Israel asked the Lebanese government's Ministry of Economy and Trade to block the film because its star, Gal Gadot, is Israeli.[176] The Lebanese government did not, however, ban Gadot's Fast & Furious films which did screen in Lebanon.[177][178] On June 7, Variety reported that a Tunisian court suspended the theatrical release of Wonder Woman after a lawsuit brought by the Al-Chaab party and the Tunisian Association of Young Lawyers to have the film blocked due to Gadot's Israeli citizenship, military service, and public comments in support of the Israeli military during the 2014 war in Gaza.[179] Jordan was reportedly also considering a ban of the film and suspended screenings pending a decision,[180] but on June 11, Al Bawaba reported that the government decided not to do so, as there was no legal precedent for it.[181]\\r\\nSome men were unhappy with women-only screenings held at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin, with some opponents of the gender-restricted screening stating on platforms such as Facebook that such screenings were discriminatory against men.[182][183][184]\\r\\nAn Albany Law School professor initiated a complaint with Austin's Equal Employment and Fair Housing Office claiming discrimination against male prospective customers and employees of the theater.[185] The chain responded with an online statement saying the event \\"may have created confusionwe want everybody to see this film\\" and announced a similar event at their Brooklyn location. Tickets sold out in less than an hour, prompting the chain to schedule additional screenings.[182] On July 18, Alamo Drafthouse proposed settlement offers of a Wonder Woman DVD to the complainants, stating \\"Respondent did not realize that advertising a 'women's only' screening was a violation of discrimination laws\\"[186]\\r\\nWonder Woman grossed $412.6?million in the United States and Canada and $409.3?million in other territories for a worldwide total of $821.9?million, against a production budget of $149?million.[4] Estimates for the number the film needed to surpass internationally in order to cover its production and promotional costs and break even ranged from $300?million[187] to $460?million.[188]\\r\\nIn May 2017, early tracking had Wonder Woman opening with $65ÿ75?million, and possibly as high as $105?million.[189][190][191][192][187] The film opened Friday, June 2, 2017, across 4,165 theaters and made $38.7?million on its opening day, including $3.7?million in IMAX. It was the biggest single-day gross for a woman-directed film, ahead of the $35.9?million opening Friday of Catherine Hardwicke's Twilight in 2008 and the biggest opening day for a woman-led comic book superhero film, ahead of Ghost in the Shell ($7?million).[193] This included $11?million it made from Thursday previews, also the best start for a film directed by a woman, surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey's $8.6?million which was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, and the third-biggest of the year, behind Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Of that, $1.5?million came from IMAX screenings.[194][195]\\r\\nEarning a total of $103.3?million on its opening weekend, the film recorded a number of records: the biggest domestic opening of all time for a female director (surpassing previous record holder Fifty Shades of Grey by Sam Taylor-Johnson), the biggest DC Comics release without Batman or Superman (ahead of Constantine), the sixth-biggest non-sequel comic book superhero debut ever, as well as the sixth-biggest June debut weekend.[196] Its three-day opening alone made it the highest-grossing woman-led comic book superhero film ever (surpassing Ghost in the Shell).[197] It was also the 16th superhero film to cross $100?million in its domestic box office launch.[198] About 9% ($9?million) of the opening weekend came from IMAX screenings from 343 theaters.[199] In its second week the film grossed $58.5?million, again topping the box office. It marked a 43.3% drop for its second weekend at the box office, better than the average 50ÿ60% decline superhero films tend to see, and was a better second weekend than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ($51.3?million) and Suicide Squad ($43.5?million).[200] In its third weekend it grossed $40.8?million, finishing second behind newcomer Cars 3 ($53.5?million). It was the second-best third weekend ever for Warner Bros. and was nearly double what Batman v Superman ($23.3?million), Suicide Squad ($20.9?million) and Man of Steel ($20.7?million) made in their third weekends. It earned $24.9?million and $15.7?million in its fourth and fifth weekends, respectively, dropping just 39% and 36% despite facing rough competition from opening films Transformers: The Last Knight and Despicable Me 3.[201] It eventually became the highest-grossing film directed by a woman, surpassing the previous records of Jennifer Yuh Nelson's Kung Fu Panda 2 and Phyllida Lloyd's Mamma Mia!.[8] By August 8, the film had garnered $400?million in ticket sales, becoming the second female-fueled film (after Disney's Beauty and the Beast), Warner Bros.' third-biggest movie (after Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises), holding the record of the highest-earning superhero origin filmsupplanting the previous record held by Spider-Man (2002), and also becoming the highest-earning film with a female director in terms of domestic earningssurpassing Frozen (2013).[202][203]\\r\\nInternationally, the film was released day-and-date with its North American debut in 55 markets (72% of its total release), and was projected to debut with anywhere between $92ÿ118?million.[187] It ended up opening to $125?million, including $38?million in China, $8.5?million in Korea, $8.4?million in Mexico, $8.3?million in Brazil and $7.5?million in the UK.[204] In its second week of release, the film brought in another $60?million, including holding the top spot on France, the UK, Australia and Brazil.[205] As of June 25, 2017, the biggest markets of Wonder Woman outside North America are China (US$90?million) followed by Brazil (US$34?million), UK (US$28?million) and Australia (US$24?million). In the Philippines, it broke 2017 box office record for highest-earning non-holiday opening dayearning $4.7?million and becoming the 6th-most successful commercial film of all time as well overtaking the record set by Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[206][207][208] The film opened in its last market, Japan, on August 25 and debuted to $3.4?million, helping the international gross cross the $400?million mark.[209]\\r\\nWonder Woman received largely positive reviews from film critics, with some calling it the best film in the DC Extended Universe, and praising Jenkins' direction, performances, chemistry of Gadot and Pine and musical score.[7][213] On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 360 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Thrilling, earnest, and buoyed by Gal Gadot's charismatic performance, Wonder Woman succeeds in spectacular fashion.\\"[214] It is the highest-rated superhero film on the site.[9][note 1] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 76 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[215] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale.[216]\\r\\nCritics commented favorably on Gadot's performance of the titular character and Chris Pine's Steve Trevor.[217][218][212] Andrew Barker of Variety found the film to be more lighthearted than recent DC Comics films: \\"Never prone to stewing in solitude, and taking more notes from Richard Donner than from Christopher Nolan, Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman provides a welcome respite from DC's house style of grim darknessboisterous, earnest, sometimes sloppy, yet consistently entertainingwith star Gal Gadot proving an inspired choice for this avatar of truth, justice, and the Amazonian way.\\"[219] Vox stated \\"Trevor is the superhero girlfriend comic book movies need\\".[220] The San Francisco Chronicle's Mick LaSalle lauded the performances of Gadot, Pine, Huston, and Thewlis while commending the film's \\"different perspective\\" and humor.[221] Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times described Gadot's performance as inspirational, heroic, heartfelt and endearing and the most \\"real\\" Wonder Woman portrayal.[222]\\r\\nA. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that it \\"briskly shakes off blockbuster branding imperatives and allows itself to be something relatively rare in the modern superhero cosmos. It feels less like yet another installment in an endless sequence of apocalyptic merchandising opportunities than like ... what's the word I'm looking for? A movie. A pretty good one, too.\\"[223] Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune compared the film to Captain America: The First Avenger, noting that as with \\"the first Captain America movie over in the Marvel Comics universe, DC's Wonder Woman offers the pleasures of period re-creation for a popular audience. Jenkins and her design team make 1918-era London; war-torn Belgium; the Ottoman Empire; and other locales look freshly realized, with a strong point of view. There are scenes here of dispossessed war refugees, witnessed by an astonished and heartbroken Diana, that carry unusual gravity for a comic book adaptation.\\"[224] Katie Erbland of IndieWire commended its thematic depth, explaining that \\"Wonder Woman is a war movie. Patty Jenkins' firstand we hope not lastentry into the DC Expanded Universe is primarily set during World War I, but while the feature doesn't balk at war-time violence, it's the internal battles of its compelling heroine that are most vital.\\"[225] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap similarly felt that, \\"Diana's scenes of action are thrilling precisely because they're meant to stop war, not to foment it; the idea of a demi-god using love to fight war might sound goofy in the abstract, but Jenkins makes the concept work.\\"[226] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post praised Gadot and Pine's performances as well the film's detailed plot and narrative while comparing of some slow-motion action sequences to The Matrix.[227] Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine hailed the film as a \\"cut above nearly all the superhero movies that have been trotted out over the past few summers\\" while praising Gadot's performance as \\"charming\\" and \\"marvelous\\" and commending Jenkins' direction of the film as a step forward for women directors in directing big-budget blockbuster films in Hollywood.[228]\\r\\nElise Jost of Moviepilot observed that \\"Gadot's take on Wonder Woman is one of those unique cases of an actor merging with their story, similar to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman, and Wonder Woman is Gal Gadot.\\"[212] Jost praised Gadot's interpretation of Wonder Woman as the one in which Gadot \\"absolutely nails the character's unwaveringly positive outlook on life. She's a force of nature who believes in the greater good; her conviction that she's meant to save the world is stronger than her bullet-deflecting shield. She's genuine, she's fun, she's the warm source of energy at the heart of the movie.\\"[212] The Federalist suggests that Wonder Woman is \\"a story of Jesus\\". \\"The movie is wrapped up in faux Greek mythology, true, but there's no mistaking the Christology here.\\"[229] \\"Perhaps Christ in the form of a beautiful and kick-ass Amazon is all that our contemporary society can handle right now\\", stated M. Hudson, a Christian feminist.[229] On HuffPost cultural critic, G. Roger Denson, who regards the superhero genre as a source of contemporary \\"Mainstream Mythopoetics\\" (\\"the making of new yet vitally meaningful, if not symbolic, stories filled with imagery reflecting, yet also shaping and advancing, the political, legal, moral and social practices of today\\"), wrote that the \\"No Man's Land\\" scene \\"that people are crying over in theaters and raving about afterward happens to be among the most powerfully mythopoetic scenes ever filmed at the same time it is one of the oldest myths to have been utilized by artists and writers after it had been invented by early military strategists and leaders.\\" Specifically \\"used by director Patty Jenkins\\", the scene raises \\"the esteem for powerful yet compassionate women as heroes and leaders to a level equal with that of men for having won over a huge and adoring popular audience around the world\\".[230]\\r\\nSteve Rose in The Guardian criticized the film for failing to explore the material's potential for \\"patriarchy-upending subversion\\".[231] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone criticized the film's over-reliance on exposition: \\"Wonder Woman is hobbled by a slogging origin story and action that only comes in fits and starts. Just when Gadot and director Patty Jenkins...are ready to kick ass, we get backstory.\\"[232]\\r\\n\\"Gas was intended to win the war. On that much Wonder Woman is absolutely right.\\" said David Hambling in Popular Mechanics.[233] Rachel Becker of The Verge stated that despite the scientific liberties of using a \\"hydrogen-based\\" chemical weapon as a plot device, the film succeeds in evoking real and horrifying history. \\"First off, mustard gas is such a horrible, terrifying weapon, it doesn't need to be made more potent. But if you were a chemist bent on raining destruction on the Allied forces, you wouldn't do it by replacing the sulfur atom in mustard gas with a hydrogen atom. You'd know that sulfur is the linchpin holding together this poisonous molecule.\\"[234]\\r\\nWonder Woman appeared on several critics' lists of the best films of 2017.[235]\\r\\nHonorable Mentions:\\r\\nWonder Woman has been the subject of a discussion regarding the appearance and representation of female power in general, and of female action heroes in particular[250] since her initial 1941 appearance in Sensation Comics,[250] as she was created to document \\"the growth in the power of women\\", while wearing \\"a golden tiara, a red bustier, blue underpants and knee-high, red leather boots.\\"[251] She was blacklisted a year later in 1942 in the \\"Publications Disapproved for Youth\\" because, the group behind the list argued, she was \\"not sufficiently dressed\\".[251][252]\\r\\nA few decades later, second-wave feminist Gloria Steinem's[253] Ms. Magazine debuted in 1972 with an image of Wonder Woman on the cover. Historian Tim Hanley suggested that this move shifted \\"the focus away from female superiority to sisterhood and equality, essentially making her a mascot of the women's movement\\".[250][254][255] This perception shifted over the years, however, as demonstrated in December 2016 when the United Nations decided to drop the title of \\"honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls\\" which it had given to the comic book character Wonder Woman a few months before, in a ceremony attended by the actors who had portrayed her (Lynda Carter and Gal Gadot).[256] The title was dropped in response to a petition signed by 44,000 people which argued that Wonder Woman undermines female empowerment due to her costume, described as a \\"shimmery, thigh-baring bodysuit with an American flag motif and knee-high boots\\". The petition stated that \\"it is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualised image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls\\".[257][258][254] Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins responded to both the petition and to the U.N.'s decision by stating that she thinks \\"that that's sexist. I think it's sexist to say you can't have both. I have to ask myself what I would apply to any other superhero\\".[259]\\r\\nThe debate continued with the release of Jenkins' 2017 film, Wonder Woman, which according to the BBC had \\"some thinking it's too feminist and others thinking it's not feminist enough\\".[260][261][262][263][264] Kyle Killian found an inherent contradiction in the construction of Wonder Woman as \\"a warrior\\" whom, she states, is also highly sexualized. Killian thus suggests that these elements \\"should not be the focus of a kickass heroineher beauty, bone structure, and sexinessif she is to be a feminist icon\\".[265] Theresa Harold concurred, comparing Wonder Woman to Katniss Everdeen (of The Hunger Games), who \\"didn't have to wear a teenager's wet dream of a costume to fight in\\".[266] Christina Cauterucci also felt that Wonder Woman's ability to be considered a \\"feminist antidote\\" was undermined by her \\"sex appeal\\".[267] Other critics refer to the construction of Wonder Woman in the film as \\"an implausible post-feminist hero\\".[252][268]\\r\\nJenkins disagrees with this line of critique, however. She has stated that she was raised by a second-wave \\"feminist mother\\",[269][270] who taught her to be \\"both super aware that there had been sexism but also: 'Congratulationsthank you, now I get to do whatever I want, Mom!'\\"[269] Jenkins thus notes that it is this upbringing which has led her to question a feminist critique of Wonder Womans costume.[271] When she was working on her own version of Wonder Woman's \\"Gladiator\\" re-design of the outfit (in the 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice)[272] Jenkins decided that Wonder Woman (as well as the other Amazons) \\"shouldn't be dressed in armor like men [...] It should be different [...] I, as a woman, want Wonder Woman to be hot as hell, fight badass, and look great at the same timethe same way men want Superman to have huge pecs and an impractically big body.\\"[17] Jenkins also notes that she is \\"frustrated\\" by the critique of Wonder Woman's appearance, stating \\"when people get super critical about her outfit, who's the one getting crazy about what a woman wears? That's who she is; that's Wonder Woman.\\"[270] Gal Gadot concurred with Jenkins, arguing that the character \\"is a feminist\\"[273] as \\"feminism is about equality and choice and freedom. And the writers, Patty and myself all figured that the best way to show that is to show Diana as having no awareness of social roles. She has no gender boundaries. To her, everyone is equal.\\"[274]\\r\\nCritics such as Valerie Estelle Frankel support Jenkins' vision. Frankel argues that the film subverts the male gaze,[271] stating that the construction of Wonder Woman tends to shift every few decades as it reflects the state of feminism during different time periods, including third-wave feminism (which reflects Jenkins' approach).[271][275][276] Zoe Williams offers a similar argument stating that while Wonder Woman \\"is sort of naked a lot of the time\\" it isn't, at the same time, \\"objectification so much as a cultural reset: having thighs, actual thighs you can kick things with, not thighs that look like arms, is a feminist act\\".[277] Williams then juxtaposes Wonder Woman to past female action heroes such as Sarah Connor, Ellen Ripley, and Lara Croft, whom she suggests were all constructed for the male gaze, in which a \\"female warrior becomes a sex object\\", (a point which she argues that Jenkins directly references in the film).[277] Gloria Steinem thought that the film \\"was very good\\" as it made Wonder Woman's \\"Amazon origin story clear; she was stopping war, not perpetuating it.\\" Steinem also noted that she knew \\"some women were disappointed by all the makeup, but I may be desperateI was just happy that the Amazons had wild hair!\\" Her only complaint lay in the choice to eliminate the World War II setting as the Wonder Woman comic book developed in response to existing comics that were \\"so sadistic and racist that there was a congressional hearing on the subject\\".[278] Steinem also gave Hillary Clinton the first Wonder Woman Award in October 2017 during the Women's Media Center's \\"Speaking Truth to Power Awards\\" (an organization created by Steinem, Jane Fonda, and Robin Morgan). Upon receiving the award, Clinton noted that she had seen Jenkins' Wonder Woman film and that she \\"loved the outfit\\". She also said that as her granddaughter was \\"really keen\\" on Wonder Woman, Clinton \\"thought maybe I could borrow something from her for the night. It didn't quite work for me, but I will say that this award means a lot to me because as a little girl, and then as a young woman, and then as a slightly older woman, I always wondered when Wonder Woman would have her time, and now that has happened.\\"[279] Clinton had previously praised Jenkins' film, in a public August 2017 message, stating that \\"it was just as inspirational as I'd suspected a movie about a strong, powerful woman in a fight to save the world from international disaster would be.\\"[280][281][282]\\r\\nDirector James Cameron continued this debate, through his critique of the representation of female power in Jenkins' film. In an August 2017 interview with The Guardian, Cameron qualifies Jenkins' vision of Wonder Woman as \\"an objectified icon\\" and called the film \\"a step backwards\\". In contrast, he states, his character Sarah Connor (from his Terminator films) \\"was not a beauty icon. She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit.\\"[283] Jenkins stated in response that Cameron's \\"inability to understand what 'Wonder Woman' is, or stands for, to women all over the world is unsurprising as, though he is a great filmmaker, he is not a woman\\". She further argued \\"there is no right and wrong kind of powerful woman\\" because \\"if women have to always be hard, tough and troubled to be strong, and we aren't free to be multidimensional or celebrate an icon of women everywhere because she is attractive and loving, then we haven't come very far have we.\\"[284] Reaction to this debate was mixed. Julie Miller sided with Cameron whom she states refers to himself as \\"a pretty hardcore feminist\\" and who told Vulture that \\"I have no problem writing a script in which the males become subservient to the females, which is what happens in Aliens [...] It's up to Ripley to win the day.\\" In contrast, Miller argues that Jenkins and Gadot envisioned Wonder Woman as \\"a woman who exuded both femininity and strength, along with genuine confusion as to why men would treat women differently than they do other men\\".[285] Susannah Breslin also agreed with Cameron, describing Jenkins' Wonder Woman as \\"a Playmate with a lasso\\" and \\"female power with no balls\\".[286] Others were more critical of Cameron's critique.[287] An article in Newsweek suggested that Cameron's films include \\"lot of objectification\\", and included quotes from Hollywood celebrities such as Jesse McLaren who commented that \\"James Cameron's just confused there's a female hero whose motivations aren't centered around motherhood.\\"[288] Noah Berlatsky found areas of agreement between both Cameron and Jenkins, stating that while Cameron's objection is \\"an old point that's been made over and over for decades\\", Jenkins film isn't \\"solely focused on objectifying Gal Gadot for a male audience\\".[289]\\r\\nA few weeks later in September, Cameron reiterated his criticism in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. He compared Gal Gadot's representation of the character to Raquel Welch films of the 1960s,[290] and reinforced a comparison with Linda Hamilton's portrayal of Sarah Connor. He argued that Connor was \\"if not ahead of its time, at least a breakthrough in its time\\" because though she \\"looked great\\", she \\"wasn't treated as a sex object\\".[290] He also stated that he while he \\"applaud[s] Patty directing the film and Hollywood, uh, 'letting' a woman direct a major action franchise, I didn't think there was anything groundbreaking in Wonder Woman. I thought it was a good film. Period.\\"[290] Former Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter responded to Cameron's The Hollywood Reporter interview by asking him to \\"Stop dissing WW.\\" Like Jenkins, she suggests that while Cameron does \\"not understand the character\\", she does. She also refers to Cameron's critiques as \\"thuggish jabs at a brilliant director\\" that \\"are ill advised\\" as the \\"movie was spot on\\". Carter also states that she has the authority to make these observations because she has \\"embodied this character for more than 40 years\\".[291][292][293] A month later, Jenkins responded to Cameron's comments once again in an interview with Variety, stating that she \\"was not upset at all\\" as \\"everybody is entitled to their own opinion. But if you're going to debate something in a public way, I have to reply that I think it's incorrect.\\"[294] Tricia Ennis was also critical of Cameron's statements, arguing that \\"while he may consider himself a feminist and an ally to women, [he] is not very good at it\\" as being an ally means using his position of privilege \\"without silencing the voices of those you're trying to help\\". She also states that it \\"is not enough to simply call yourself a feminist. It's not even enough to create a strong female character [...] You have to bring women to the table. You have to let them speak. You cannot speak for them. But speaking for women is exactly what Cameron is doing through his comments [...] Cameron is using his position of power as a respected producer and director to silence women.\\"[295]\\r\\nOriginally signed for three feature films, with Wonder Woman and Justice League being her second and third films, Gadot signed an extension to her contract for additional films.[319] Jenkins initially signed for only one film,[320] but in an interview with Variety, Geoff Johns revealed that he and Jenkins are writing the treatment for a Wonder Woman sequel and that he has a \\"cool idea for the second one\\". At the 2017 San Diego Comic Con, Warner Bros. officially announced a sequel would be released on December 13, 2019, and would be titled Wonder Woman 2; the date was later moved up to November 1, 2019 to avoid competition with Star Wars: Episode IX.[321][322][323] Later, Jenkins was officially signed to return as director, with confirmation that Gadot will be returning as the titular role.[324] On August 19, 2017, actress Geena Davis stated that she would like very much to play a role in Wonder Woman 2 and that she is in talks with Jenkins about that matter.[325] Days later, the studio hired Dave Callaham to co-write the film's script with Jenkins and Johns.[326]","input":"What war was taking place in wonder woman?"},{"output":"Punjab","context":"The Geography of Pakistan (Urdu: ??????? ??????????) is a profound blend of landscapes varying from plains to deserts, forests, hills, and plateaus ranging from the coastal areas of the Arabian Sea in the south to the mountains of the Karakoram range in the north. Pakistan geologically overlaps both with the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates where its Sindh and Punjab provinces lie on the north-western corner of the Indian plate while Balochistan and most of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa lie within the Eurasian plate which mainly comprises the Iranian Plateau. Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence are prone to violent earthquakes where the two tectonic plates collide.\\r\\nPakistan is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west and Iran to the southwest while China borders the country in the northeast. The nation is geopolitically placed within some of the most controversial regional boundaries which share disputes and have many-a-times escalated military tensions between the nations, e.g., that of Kashmir with India and the Durand Line with Afghanistan. Its western borders include the Khyber Pass and Bolan Pass that have served as traditional migration routes between Central Eurasia and South Asia.\\r\\nAt 796,096 square kilometres (307,374?sq?mi), Pakistan is the 36th largest country by area, at more than twice the size of California, and slightly larger than Alberta.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPakistan shares its borders with four neighboring countries ÿ Afghanistan, China, India, and Iran ÿ adding up to about 6,975?km (4,334.1?mi) in length (excluding the coastal areas).\\r\\nPakistan definitely borders Afghanistan at the Durand Line, 2,430?km (1,509.9?mi), which runs from the Hindu Kush and the Pamir Mountains. Its proposal was drafted by and named after the former secretary of British India Sir Henry Mortimer Durand. When Pakistan became independent in 1947 however, the legitimacy of the demarcation was questioned and disputed by Afghans and the Pakhtun or Pashtun tribes. Afghanistan claimed the border was imposed upon their weak nation by stronger influences and favoured the establishment of another separatist state to be called Pakhtunistan.[1] The Durand Line remained disputed until 1994 when it was finally accepted. A narrow strip of Afghan-occupied Gorno-Badakhshan territory called the Wakhan Corridor extends between Pakistan and Tajikistan.[2] From the eastern tip of the Wakhan Corridor starts the Sino-Pak border between the People's Republic of China and Pakistan spanning about 510?km (316.9?mi). It carries on south-eastward and ends near the Karakoram Pass. This line was determined from 1961 to 1965 in a series of agreements between China and Pakistan and finally on 03-03-1963 both the governments, of Islamabad and Beijing, formally agreed. It is understood that if the dispute over Kashmir is resolved, the border would need to be discussed again.[2]\\r\\nThe boundary with Iran, 909?km (564.8?mi), was first delimited by a British commission in the same year as the Durand Line was demarcated, separating Iran from what was then British India's Baluchistan province.[2] Modern Iran has a province named Sistan va Baluchistan that borders Pakistan and has Baluchis in an ethnic majority. In 1957 Pakistan signed a frontier agreement with Iran in Rawalpindi according to which the border was officially declared and the two countries haven't had this border as a subject of serious dispute at all. The Northern Areas has five of the world's seventeen highest peaks along with highest range of mountains the Karakoram and Himalayas. It also has such extensive glaciers that it has sometimes been called the \\"Third Pole\\". The international border-line has been a matter of pivotal dispute between Pakistan and India ever since 1947, and the Siachen Glacier in northern Kashmir has been an important arena for fighting between the two sides since 1984, although far more soldiers have died of exposure to the cold than from any skirmishes in the conflict between their National Armies facing each other.\\r\\nThe Pakistan-India ceasefire line runs from the Karakoram Pass west-southwest to a point about 130 kilometers northwest of Lahore. This line, about 770 kilometers long, was arranged with United Nations (UNO) assistance at the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947ÿ48. The ceasefire line came into effect on January 1, 1949, after eighteen months of fighting between Indian forces and Afridi tribals which Pakistan had sent to occupy Kashmir and was last adjusted and agreed upon by the two countries according to the Shimla Agreement of July 2, 1972 between Indira Gandhi and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Since then, it has been generally known as the Line of Control or the (LoC).\\r\\nThe IndiaÿPakistan border continues irregularly southward for about 1,280 kilometers, following the Radcliffe line, named for Sir Cyril Radcliffe, the head of the British boundary commission on the division of the Punjab and Bengal provinces of British India on 13 August 1947.\\r\\nThe southern borders are far less contentious than those in northern Pakistan (Kashmir). The Thar Desert in the province of Sindh is separated in the south from the salt flats of the Rann of Kachchh (Kutch) by a boundary that was first delineated in 1923ÿ24. After independence and dissolution of Empire, Independent and free Pakistan contested the southern boundary of Sindh, and a succession of border incidents resulted. They were less dangerous and less widespread, however, than the conflict that erupted in Kashmir in the Indo-Pakistani War of August 1965 started with this decisive core of issues. These southern hostilities were ended by British mediation during Harold Wilson's era, and both sides accepted the award of the Indo-Pakistan Western Boundary Case Tribunal designated by the UN secretary general himself. The tribunal made its award on February 19, 1968; delimiting a line of 403 kilometers that was later demarcated by joint survey teams, Of its original claim of some 9,100 square kilometers, Pakistan was awarded only about 780 square kilometers. Beyond the western terminus of the tribunal's award, the final stretch of Pakistan's border with India is about 80 kilometers long, running east and southeast of Sindh to an inlet of the Arabian Sea.\\r\\nPakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands; the Indus River plain, with two major subdivisions corresponding roughly to the provinces of Punjab and Sindh; and the Balochistan Plateau. Some geographers designate additional major regions. For example, the mountain ranges along the western border with Afghanistan are sometimes described separately from the Balochistan Plateau, and on the eastern border with India, south of the Sutlej River, the Thar Desert may be considered separately from the Indus Plain. Nevertheless, the country may conveniently be visualized in general terms as divided in three by an imaginary line drawn eastward from the Khyber Pass and another drawn southwest from Islamabad down the middle of the country. Roughly, then, the northern highlands are north of the imaginary east-west line; the Balochistan Plateau is to the west of the imaginary southwest line; and the Indus Plain lies to the east of that line.\\r\\nThe northern highlands include parts of the Hindu Kush, the Karakoram Range, and the Himalayas. This area includes such famous peaks as K2[3] (Mount Godwin Austen, at 8,611 meters the second highest peak in the world). More than one-half of the summits are over 4,500 meters, and more than fifty peaks reach above 6,500 meters. Travel through the area is difficult and dangerous, although the government is attempting to develop certain areas into tourist and trekking sites. Because of their rugged topography and the rigours of the climate, the northern highlands and the Himalayas to the east have been formidable barriers to movement into Pakistan throughout history.\\r\\nSouth of the northern highlands and west of the Indus River plain are the Safed Koh Range along the Afghanistan border and the Sulaiman Range and Kirthar Range, which define the western extent of the province of Sindh and reach almost to the southern coast. The lower reaches are far more arid than those in the north, and they branch into ranges that run generally to the southwest across the province Balochistan. North-south valleys in Balochistan and Sindh have restricted the migration of peoples along the Makran Coast on the Arabian Sea east toward the plains.\\r\\nSeveral large passes cut the ranges along the border with Afghanistan. Among them are the Khojak Pass, about eighty kilometres northwest of Quetta in Balochistan; the Khyber Pass, forty kilometres west of Peshawar and leading to Kabul; and the Broghol Pass in the far north, providing access to the Wakhan Corridor.\\r\\nLess than one-fifth of Pakistan's land area has the potential for intensive agricultural use. Nearly all of the arable land is actively cultivated, but outputs are low by world standards. Cultivation is sparse in the northern mountains, the southern deserts, and the western plateaus, but the Indus River basin in Punjab and northern Sindh has fertile soil that enables Pakistan to feed its population under usual climatic conditions.\\r\\nThe name Indus comes from the Sanskrit word sindhu, meaning ocean, from which also come the words Sindh, Hindu, and India. The Indus, one of the great rivers of the world, rises in southwestern Tibet only about 160 kilometres west of the source of the Sutlej River, which first flows through Punjab, India and joins the Indus in Pakistani Punjab, and the Brahmaputra, which runs eastward before turning southwest and flowing through India and, Bangladesh. The catchment area of the Indus is estimated at almost 1 million square kilometres, and all of Pakistan's major riversthe Kabul, Jhelum and, Chenabflow into it. The Indus River basin is a large, fertile alluvial plain formed by silt from the Indus. This area has been inhabited by agricultural civilizations for at least 5,000 years.\\r\\nBalochistan is located at the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau and in the border region between Southwest, Central, and South Asia. It is geographically the largest of the four provinces at 347,190?km2 or (134,051 square miles) of Pakistani territory; and composes 48% of the total land area of Pakistan. The population density is very low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. The southern region is known as Makran. The central region is known as Kalat.\\r\\nThe Sulaiman Mountains dominate the northeast corner and the Bolan Pass is a natural route into Afghanistan towards Kandahar. Much of the province south of the Quetta region is sparse desert terrain with pockets of inhabitable towns mostly near rivers and streams. The largest desert is the Kharan Desert which occupies the most of Kharan District.\\r\\nThis area is subject to frequent seismic disturbances because the tectonic plate under the Indian plate hits the plate under Eurasia as it continues to move northward and to push the Himalayas ever higher. The region surrounding Quetta is highly prone to earthquakes. A severe quake in 1931 was followed by one of more destructive force in 1935. The small city of Quetta was almost completely destroyed, and the adjacent military cantonment was heavily damaged. At least 20,000 people were killed. Tremors continue in the vicinity of Quetta; the most recent major earthquake occurred in October 2008. In January 1991 a severe earthquake destroyed entire villages in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, but far fewer people were killed in the quake than died in 1935. A major earthquake centred in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Kohistan District in 1965 also caused heavy damage.\\r\\nPakistan lies in the temperate zone, immediately above the tropic of cancer. The climate varies from tropical to temperate. Arid conditions exist in the coastal south, characterized by a monsoon season with adequate rainfall and a dry season with lesser rainfall, while abundant rainfall is experienced by the province of Punjab, and wide variations between extremes of temperature at given locations. Rainfall varies from as little as less than 10?inches a year to over 150?inches a year, in various parts of the nation. These generalizations should not, however, obscure the distinct differences existing among particular locations. For example, the coastal area along the Arabian Sea is usually warm, whereas the frozen snow-covered ridges of the Karakoram Range and of other mountains of the far north are so cold year round that they are only accessible by world-class climbers for a few weeks in May and June of each year.\\r\\nPakistan has four seasons: a cool, dry winter marked by mild temperatures from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. The onset and duration of these seasons vary somewhat according to location.\\r\\nThe climate in the capital city of Islamabad varies from an average daily low of 5?C (41.0?F) in January to an average daily high of 40?C (104?F) in June. Half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August, averaging about 300 millimetres (11.81?in) in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about 100 millimetres (3.94?in) per month. Hailstorms are common in early spring.\\r\\nPakistan's largest city, Karachi, which is also the country's industrial center, is more humid than Islamabad but gets significantly lesser rainfall. Only July and August average more than 50 millimetres (1.97?in) of rainfall in the Karachi area; the remaining months are exceedingly dry with little rainfall. The temperature is also more uniform in Karachi than in Islamabad, ranging from an average daily low of 13?C (55.4?F) during winter evenings to an average daily high of 34?C (93.2?F) on summer days. Although the summer temperatures do not get as high as those in Punjab, the high humidity causes the residents a great deal of discomfort.\\r\\nHydrological power is a renewable resource which benefits Pakistan a lot. After the Indus Water Treaty on 1960 World Bank decided that River Sutlej, Ravi and Beas water will be used by India and River Indus, Jhelum and Chenab water will be used by Pakistan. Pakistan was told to build 2 Dams one Tarbela And second Mangla, 5 Barrages, 8 Link Canals and one gated siphon. For this India was told to Participate 60% while Pakistan will participate 40%. Pakistan is considering to develop wind turbines to fulfill the demand for electricity.solar power is now slowly flourishing but it is still installed on a small scale.\\r\\nPakistan Largest River is known as River Indus which Flows from Tibet China and enters through Pakistan by Gilgit Baltistan. River Indus System is known as Indus System. It is divided into two plains. Upper Indus Plain starts from Northern Pakistan and ends up at Mithankot. River Indus has tributaries on both western and eastern side. River Indus eastern tributaries are River Jhelum, Chenab, Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. These four rivers flow in Punjab. These four rivers meet at Panjnad where they are known as River Panjnad. River Indus western tributaries are River Swat, Kabul, Kurrram, Tochi, Gomal, Zhob. These rivers join River Indus at KPK. At Mithankot these rivers finally meet with River Indus. After this River Indus flows alone through Lower Indus Plain. Lower Indus Plain Starts from Mithankot up to Thatta where River Indus meets with the Arabian Sea. This place is also known as Indus Delta.\\r\\nPakistan has extensive energy resources, including fairly sizable natural gas reserves, petroleum oil reserves, coal fields and large hydropower potential.\\r\\nAbout 26% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. The most important crops are tobacco, cotton, wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize, sorghum, millets, pulses, oil seeds, barley, fruits and vegetables, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output.[4]\\r\\nFishery and fishing industry plays an important role in the national economy of Pakistan. With a coastline of about 1046km, Pakistan has enough fishery resources that remain to be fully developed. It is also a major source of export earning.\\r\\nAbout only 4% of land in Pakistan is covered with forests. The forests of Pakistan are a main source of food, lumber, paper, fuel wood, latex, medicine as well as used for purposes of wildlife conservation and Eco tourism.\\r\\nThe Salt Range in the Potwar Plateau has large deposits of rock salt. Pakistan has extensive mineral resources, including fairly sizable reserves of gypsum, limestone, chromites, iron ore, rock salt, silver, gold, precious stones, gems, marbles, tiles, copper, sulfur, fire clay and silica sand.\\r\\nThe environmental issues is a great problem for the nature and nation of Pakistan and has been disturbing the balance between economic development and environmental protection. As Pakistan is a large importer of both exhaustible and renewable natural resources and a large consumer of fossil fuels, the Ministry of Environment of Government of Pakistan takes responsibility to conserve and protect the environment.\\r\\nCurrent issues: water pollution from raw sewage, industrial wastes, and agricultural runoff; limited natural fresh water resources; a majority of the population does not have access to potable water; deforestation; soil erosion; desertification.\\r\\nPakistan is subject to frequent earthquakes which are often severe (especially in north and west) and severe flooding along the Indus after heavy rains (July and August). Landslides are common in the northern mountains.\\r\\nThere are 15 national parks, 72 wildlife sanctuaries, 66 game reserves, 9 marine and littoral protected areas, 19 protected wetlands and a number of other protected grasslands, shrublands, woodlands and natural monuments.\\r\\nPakistan is a party to several international agreements related to environment and climate, the most prominent among them are:\\r\\nParts of region and settlement names:","input":"What are the most fertile regions of pakistan?"},{"output":"231 AD","context":"\\r\\nA wheelbarrow is a small hand-propelled vehicle, usually with just one wheel, designed to be pushed and guided by a single person using two handles at the rear, or by a sail to push the ancient wheelbarrow by wind. The term \\"wheelbarrow\\" is made of two words: \\"wheel\\" and \\"barrow.\\" \\"Barrow\\" is a derivation of the Old English \\"bearwe\\" which was a device used for carrying loads.\\r\\nThe wheelbarrow is designed to distribute the weight of its load between the wheel and the operator, so enabling the convenient carriage of heavier and bulkier loads than would be possible were the weight carried entirely by the operator. As such it is a second-class lever. Traditional Chinese wheelbarrows, however, had a central wheel supporting the whole load. Use of wheelbarrows is common in the construction industry and in gardening. Typical capacity is approximately 100 liters (4 cubic feet) of material.\\r\\nA two-wheel type is more stable on level ground, while the almost universal one-wheel type has better maneuverability in small spaces, on planks, in water, or when tilted ground would throw the load off balance. The use of one wheel also permits greater control of the deposition of the load upon emptying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest wheelbarrows with archaeological evidence in the form of a one-wheel cart come from second century Han Dynasty Emperor Hui's tomb murals and brick tomb reliefs.[1] The painted tomb mural of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in a tomb at Chengdu, Sichuan province, dated precisely to 118 AD.[2] The stone carved relief of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in the tomb of Shen Fujun in Sichuan province, dated circa 150 AD.[3] And then there is the story of the pious Dong Yuan pushing his father around in a single-wheel lu che barrow, depicted in a mural of the Wu Liang tomb-shrine of Shandong (dated to 147 AD).[4] However, there are even earlier accounts than this that date back to the 1st century BC and 1st century AD. The 5th century Book of Later Han stated that the wife of the once poor and youthful imperial censor Bao Xuan helped him push a lu che back to his village during their feeble wedding ceremony, around 30 BC.[2] Later, during the Red Eyebrows Rebellion (c. 20 AD) against Xin dynasty's Wang Mang (45 BCÿ23 AD), the official Zhao Xi saved his wife from danger by disguising himself and pushing her along in his lu che barrow, past a group of brigand rebels who questioned him, and allowed him to pass after he convinced them that his wife was terribly ill.[2] The first recorded description of a wheelbarrow appears in Liu Xiang's work Lives of Famous Immortals. Liu describes the invention of the wheelbarrow by the legendary Chinese mythological figure Ko Yu, who builds a \\"Wooden ox\\".[5]\\r\\nNevertheless, the Chinese historical text of the Sanguozhi (Records of the Three Kingdoms), compiled by the ancient historian Chen Shou (233ÿ297 AD), credits the invention of the wheelbarrow to Prime Minister Zhuge Liang (181ÿ234 AD) of Shu Han from 197ÿ234.[6] It was written that in 231 AD, Zhuge Liang developed the vehicle of the wooden ox and used it as a transport for military supplies in a campaign against Cao Wei.[7] Further annotations of the text by Pei Songzhi (430 AD) described the design in detail as a large single central wheel and axle around which a wooden frame was constructed in representation of an ox.[7] Writing later in the 11th century, the Song Dynasty (960ÿ1279) scholar Gao Cheng wrote that the small wheelbarrow of his day, with shafts pointing forward (so that it was pulled), was the direct descendent of Zhuge Liang's wooden ox.[8] Furthermore, he pointed out that the third century 'gliding horse' wheelbarrow featured the simple difference of the shaft pointing backwards (so that it was pushed instead).[8]\\r\\nWheelbarrows in China came in two types. The more common type after the third century has a large, centrally mounted wheel. Prior types were universally front-wheeled wheelbarrows.[9] The central-wheeled wheelbarrow could generally transport six human passengers at once, and instead of a laborious amount of energy exacted upon the animal or human driver pulling the wheelbarrow, the weight of the burden was distributed equally between the wheel and the puller.[10] European visitors to China from the 17th century onwards had an appreciation for this, and it was given a considerable amount of attention by a member of the Dutch East India Company, Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest, in his writings of 1797 (who accurately described its design and ability to hold large amounts of heavy baggage).[11] However, the lower carrying surface made the European wheelbarrow clearly more useful for short-haul work.[12] As of the 1960s, traditional wheelbarrows in China were still in wide use.[13]\\r\\nAlthough there are records of Chinese sailing carriages from the 6th century[14] these land sailing vehicles were not wheelbarrows, and the date of which the sail assisted wheelbarrow was invented is uncertain.[15] Engravings are found in van Braam Houckgeest's 1797 book.[16]\\r\\nEuropean interest in the Chinese sailing carriage is also seen in the writings of Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest in 1797, who wrote:\\r\\nNear the southern border of Shandong one finds a kind of wheelbarrow much larger than that which I have been describing, and drawn by a horse or a mule. But judge by my surprise when today I saw a whole fleet of wheelbarrows of the same size. I say, with deliberation, a fleet, for each of them had a sail, mounted on a small mast exactly fixed in a socket arranged at the forward end of the barrow. The sail, made of matting, or more often of cloth, is five or six feet high, and three or four feet broad, with stays, sheets, and halyards, just as on a Chinese ship. The sheets join the shafts of the wheelbarrow and can thus be manipulated by the man in charge.[17]\\r\\nThese sailing wheelbarrows continued in use into the twentieth century.\\r\\nM. J. T. Lewis surmised the wheelbarrow may have existed in ancient Greece in the form of a one-wheel cart.[18] Two building material inventories for 408/407 and 407/406 BC from the temple of Eleusis list, among other machines and tools, \\"1 body for a one-wheeler (hyperteria monokyklou)\\",[19] although there is no archaeological evidence to prove this hypothesis.[20](?϶?ϫ ? in Greek):\\r\\nSince dikyklos (Ѵ??) and tetrakyklos (??) mean nothing but \\"two-wheeler\\" and \\"four-wheeler,\\" and since the monokyklos (??) body is sandwiched in the Eleusis inventory between a four-wheeler body and its four wheels, to take it as anything but a one-wheeler strains credulity far beyond breaking point. It can only be a wheelbarrow, necessarily guided and balanced by a man...what does now emerge as certainty is that the wheelbarrow did not, as is universally claimed, make its European debut in the Middle Ages. It was there some sixteen centuries before.\\r\\nM. J. T. Lewis admits that the current consensus among technology historians, including Bertrand Gille, Andrea Matthies, and Joseph Needham, is that the wheelbarrow was invented in China around 100 AD.[21] However, Lewis proposes that the wheelbarrow could have also existed in ancient Greece.[9][22] Based on the Eleusis list, Lewis states that it is possible that wheelbarrows were used on Greek construction sites, but admits that archaeological evidence for the wheelbarrow in ancient farming and mining is absent.[9] He surmised that wheelbarrows were not uncommon on Greek construction sites for carrying moderately light loads. He speculates the possibility of wheelbarrows in the Roman Empire and the later Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire, although Lewis concludes that the evidence is scarce, and that \\"most of this scenario, perforce, is pure speculation.\\"[23] The 4th century Historia Augusta reports emperor Elagabalus to have used a wheelbarrow (Latin: pabillus from pabo, one-wheeled vehicle[24][25]) to transport women in his frivolous games at court.[26] While the present evidence does not indicate any use of wheelbarrows into medieval times, the question of continuity in the Byzantine Empire is still open, due to a lack of research yet.[9] Currently, there is no archaeological evidence for the wheelbarrow in ancient Greece and Rome.[20]\\r\\nThe first wheelbarrow in Europe appeared sometime between 1170 and 1250. Medieval wheelbarrows universally featured a wheel at or near the front (in contrast to their Chinese counterparts, which typically had a wheel in the center of the barrow),[27] the arrangement now universally found on wheelbarrows.\\r\\nResearch on the early history of the wheelbarrow is made difficult by the marked absence of a common terminology. The English historian of science M.J.T. Lewis has identified in English and French sources, four mentions of wheelbarrows between 1172 and 1222, three of them designated with a different term.[28] According to the medieval art historian Andrea Matthies, the first archival reference to a wheelbarrow in medieval Europe is dated 1222, specifying the purchase of several wheelbarrows for the English king's works at Dover.[29] The first depiction appears in an English manuscript, Matthew Paris's Vitae duorum Offarum, completed in 1250.[30]\\r\\nBy the 13th century, the wheelbarrow proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. However, going by surviving documents and illustrations the wheelbarrow remained a relative rarity until the 15th century.[31] It also seemed to be limited to England, France, and the Low Countries.[32] Eastward diffusion of the technology was uneven and not especially fast: the wheelbarrow was still unknown in Russia and its neighbors as late as the reign of Peter the Great. The conscript laborers who dug millions of cubic yards of earth to create the city of St. Petersburg--with its extensive system of canals and the levees and embankments required to keep the city dry--carried dirt either in handbaskets or the fronts of their long, tunic-like shirts. On the occasion of Peter's first visit to England, the young tsar and his traveling companions found a wheelbarrow in the garden of the house where they lodged; not knowing its purpose, they used it for drunken wheelbarrow races.[33]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, British inventor James Dyson introduced the Ballbarrow, an injection molded plastic wheelbarrow with a spherical ball on the front end instead of a wheel. Compared to a conventional design, the larger surface area of the ball made the wheelbarrow easier to use in soft soil, and more laterally stable with heavy loads on uneven ground.\\r\\nThe Honda HPE60, an electric power-assisted wheelbarrow, was produced in 1998.[34][35]\\r\\nPower assisted wheelbarrows are now widely available from a number of different manufacturers. Powered wheelbarrows are used in a range of applications; the technology has improved to enable them to take much heavier loads, beyond weights that a human could transport alone without assistance. Motorized wheelbarrows are generally either diesel powered or electric battery powered. Often used in small scale construction applications where access for larger plant machinery might be restricted.[36]","input":"When did the han dynasty invent the wheelbarrow?"},{"output":"65 people","context":"History\\r\\nEffects \\r\\nOther wikis\\r\\nHurricane Andrew was a Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that struck the Bahamas and Florida in mid-August 1992, the most destructive hurricane to ever hit the state. It was the strongest in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the United States until it was surpassed by Katrina in 2005. Andrew caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was felt in South Florida, with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (270 km/h). Passing directly through the city of Homestead in Dade County (now known as Miami-Dade County), it stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations. In total, it destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $26.5 billion in damage,[nb 1] and left 65 people dead.\\r\\nAndrew began as a tropical depression over the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August 16. After spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central Atlantic, it rapidly intensified into a powerful Category 5 hurricane while moving westward towards the Bahamas on August 23. Though it briefly weakened to Category 4 while traversing the Bahamas, it regained its Category 5 status before making landfall in Florida on Elliott Key and Homestead on August 24. With a barometric pressure of 922 mbar (27.23 inHg) at the time of landfall in Florida, Andrew is the fourth most intense hurricane to strike the United States. Several hours later, the hurricane emerged over the Gulf of Mexico at Category 4 strength, with the Gulf Coast of the United States in its path. After turning northwestward and weakening further, Andrew moved ashore near Morgan City, Louisiana, as a low-end Category 3 storm. After moving inland, the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity, merging with a frontal system over the southern Appalachian Mountains on August 28.\\r\\nHurricane Andrew first inflicted structural damage as it moved through the Bahamas, especially in Cat Cays, lashing the islands with storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and tornadoes. About 800 houses were destroyed in the archipelago, and there was substantial damage to the transport, water, sanitation, agriculture, and fishing sectors. Andrew left four dead and $250 million in damage throughout the Bahamas. In parts of southern Florida, Andrew produced severe winds; a wind gust of 177 mph (282 km/h) was observed at a house in Perrine. The cities of Florida City, Homestead, and Cutler Ridge received the brunt of the storm. As many as 1.4 million people lost power at the height of the storm. In the Everglades, 70,000 acres (280 km2) of trees were downed, while invasive Burmese pythons began inhabiting the region after a nearby facility housing them was destroyed. Rainfall in Florida was substantial, peaking at 13.98 inches (355 mm) in western Dade County. In Florida, Andrew killed 44 and left a record $25 billion in damage.\\r\\nPrior to making landfall in Louisiana on August 26, Andrew caused extensive damage to oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to $500?million in losses for oil companies. It produced hurricane-force winds along its path through Louisiana, damaging large stretches of power lines that left about 230,000 people without electricity. Over 80% of trees in the Atchafalaya River basin were downed, and the agriculture there was devastated. Throughout the basin and Bayou Lafourche, 187 million freshwater fish were killed in the hurricane. With 23,000 houses damaged, 985 others destroyed, and 1,951 mobile homes demolished, property losses in Louisiana exceeded $1.5 billion. The hurricane caused the deaths of 17?people in the state, 6 of whom drowned offshore. Andrew spawned at least 28 tornadoes along the Gulf Coast, especially in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. In total, Andrew left 65 dead and caused $26.5?billion in damage. It is currently the fifth costliest Atlantic hurricane to hit the United States, behind only Katrina, Sandy (2012), Ike (2008), and Harvey (2017), as well as the sixth costliest Atlantic hurricane, behind the aforementioned systems and Wilma (2005).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on August 14. A ridge of high pressure to its north caused the wave to move quickly westward. An area of convection developed along the wave axis to the south of the Cape Verde islands, and on August 15, meteorologists began classifying the system with the Dvorak technique. The thunderstorm activity became more concentrated, and narrow spiral rainbands began to develop around a center of circulation. It is estimated that Tropical Depression Three developed late on August 16, about 1,630?mi (2,620?km) east-southeast of Barbados.[1] Embedded within the deep easterlies, the depression tracked west-northwestward at 20?mph (32?km/h).[2] Initially, moderate wind shear prevented strengthening, until a decrease in shear allowed the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Andrew at 12:00?UTC on August 17.[1]\\r\\nBy early August 18, the storm maintained convection near the center with spiral bands to its west as the winds increased to 50?mph (80?km/h).[3] Shortly thereafter, the storm began weakening because of increased southwesterly wind shear from an upper-level low.[1] On August 19, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the storm failed to locate a well-defined center[4] and on the following day, a flight found that the cyclone had degenerated to the extent that only a diffuse low-level circulation center remained; observations indicated the barometric pressure rose to an unusually high 1,015?mbar (29.97?inHg). The flight indicated that Andrew maintained a vigorous circulation aloft. After the upper-level low weakened and split into a trough, the wind shear decreased over the storm. A strong high pressure cell then developed over the southeastern United States, which built eastward and caused Andrew to turn to the west.[1] Convection became more organized as upper-level outflow became better established.[5] An eye formed, and Andrew attained hurricane status early on August 22, about 650?mi (1,050?km) east-southeast of Nassau, Bahamas.[1] In the forecast issued six hours after becoming a hurricane, the cyclone was predicted to make landfall near Jupiter, Florida, with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) on August 25.[6] This underestimated both the strength and the speed of the storm, which would eventually make landfall in South Florida.[1]\\r\\nThe hurricane accelerated westward into an area of highly favorable conditions, and began to rapidly intensify late on August 22; in a 24?hour period the atmospheric pressure dropped by 47?mbar (1.388?inHg) to a minimum of 922?mbar (27.23?inHg).[1] On August 23, the storm attained Category 5 status on the SaffirÿSimpson hurricane scale, reaching peak winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) a short distance off Eleuthera island in the Bahamas at 18:00 UTC.[nb 2][7] Despite its intensity, Andrew was a small tropical cyclone, with winds of 35?mph (56?km/h) extending out only about 90 mi (150 km) from the center.[8] After reaching that intensity, the hurricane underwent an eyewall replacement cycle.[9] At 21:00 UTC on August 23, Andrew made landfall on Eleuthera with winds of 160?mph (260?km/h).[7] The cyclone weakened further while crossing the Bahama Banks, and at 01:00 UTC on August 24, Andrew hit the southern Berry Islands of the Bahamas with winds of 150?mph (240?km/h).[7] As it crossed over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, the hurricane rapidly re-intensified as the eye decreased in size and its eyewall convection deepened.[1] At 08:40 UTC on August 24, Andrew struck Elliott Key with winds of 165?mph (266?km/h) and a pressure of 926?mbar (27.34?inHg). About 25?minutes after its first Florida landfall, Andrew hit just northeast of Homestead with a slightly lower pressure of 922?mbar (27.23?inHg).[7] This barometric pressure made Andrew the most intense hurricane to strike the United States since Hurricane Camille in 1969 and the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in Florida since the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.[1]\\r\\nAs the eye moved onshore in Florida, the convection in the eyewall strengthened due to increased convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h).[1] In the Gulf of Mexico, the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north.[12] Andrew steadily re-intensified over the Gulf of Mexico, reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25.[7] As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew approached the Gulf Coast of the United States.[1]\\r\\nAt 08:30 UTC on August 26, the cyclone made landfall about 20 mi (30 km) west-southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, with winds of 115?mph (185?km/h).[7] Andrew weakened rapidly as it turned to the north and northeast, falling to tropical storm intensity within 10 hours. After entering Mississippi, the cyclone deteriorated to tropical depression status early on August 27. Accelerating northeastward, the depression began merging with the approaching frontal system, and by midday on August 28, Andrew merged with a frontal system while located over the southern Appalachian Mountains.[1] The remnants continued moving towards the northeast, and it lost its identity later that day, merging with the remnants of Hurricane Lester and a frontal zone over the Mid-Atlantic.[13]\\r\\nPost-analysis on Andrew revealed that the storm was often stronger than operationally reported between early on August 22 and early on August 26. In real time, the National Hurricane Center assessed its peak intensity as 150?mph (240?km/h),[14] which was upgraded to 155 mph (250 km/h) in a post-storm analysis after the season ended.[1] However, a 2004 paper by Christopher Landsea and others concluded that Andrew became a Category 5 hurricane near the Bahamas on August 23 and reached maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h). The paper also indicated that Andrew briefly re-intensified into a Category 5 hurricane around the time of landfall in South Florida early on August 24. The storm was found to have been slightly stronger while approaching Louisiana, but the landfall winds were decreased from 120 mph (195 km/h) to 115 mph (185 km/h).[7]\\r\\nBahamas Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham, who took office while the storm was active, urged residents to \\"take this hurricane seriously\\".[15] Before the hurricane passed through the Bahamas, forecasters predicted a storm surge of up to 18?ft (5.5?m), as well as up to 8?in (200?mm) of rain.[16] On August 22, hurricane watches were issued from Andros and Eleuthera islands northward through Grand Bahama and Great Abaco. They were upgraded to hurricane warnings later that day, and on August 23, additional warnings were issued for the central Bahamas, including Cat Island, Exuma, San Salvador Island, and Long Island. All watches and warnings were discontinued on August 24.[1] Advance warning was credited for the low death toll in the country.[17] A total of 58?shelters were opened at churches, government buildings, and schools.[15]\\r\\nInitially, forecasters predicted tides up to 14?ft (4.3?m) above normal along the east coast of Florida, near the potential location of landfall.[18] Rainfall was projected to be between 5 and 8?in (130 and 200?mm) along the path of the storm. In addition, the National Hurricane Center noted the likelihood of isolated tornadoes in Central and South Florida during the passage of Andrew on August 23 and August 24.[19] Several tropical storm and hurricane warnings were issued for much of Central and South Florida, from Titusville on the east coast to Venice on the west coast. Included in the warnings were Lake Okeechobee and all of the Florida Keys. By 18:00 UTC on August 24, all watches and warnings issued were discontinued after Andrew progressed into the Gulf of Mexico.[1]\\r\\nGovernor Lawton Chiles declared a state of emergency and activated about one-third of the Florida National Guard. Many residents evacuated, most voluntarily, from Broward, Charlotte, Collier, Lee, Martin, Dade, Monroe, Palm Beach, and Sarasota counties. A total of 142?shelters opened in these counties and collectively housed at least 84,340?people.[20] In Dade County alone, 515,670?people were ordered to evacuate.[21] As Andrew was approaching, an estimated 20,000ÿ30,000?tourists were in the Florida Keys (Monroe County).[22] Overall, almost 1.2?million people evacuated, which contributed to the low number of fatalities, despite the intensity of the storm.[1] Many evacuees also checked into hotels, with rooms completely booked as far north as Ocala. Ultimately, the sheer number of evacuees led to likely the largest traffic jam in the history of Florida, mostly along Interstate 95. United States Coast Guard vessels on or near the Florida coastline were either secured onshore or sent to ride out the storm at sea.[23] Government offices and public and private schools were closed from Monroe County northward to St. Lucie County.[24] Many colleges and universities in southeast Florida also closed, including Barry University, Broward Community College, Florida Atlantic University, Florida International University, Nova Southeastern University, and the University of Miami.[25] Major airports such as the Fort LauderdaleÿHollywood,[25] Key West,[26] Miami,[15] and Palm Beach international airports closed.[25]\\r\\nShortly after the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico from southern Florida, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane watches and warnings for the Gulf Coast of the United States beginning at 13:00 UTC on August 24. After the initial hurricane watch from Mobile, Alabama to Sabine Pass, Texas, the watches and warnings were expanded to eventually include areas from Mobile, Alabama, to Freeport, Texas. All watches and warnings on the Gulf Coast were discontinued late on August 26 after the hurricane moved inland over Louisiana.[1]\\r\\nDue to the hurricane's threat, workers fled oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, while the Coast Guard moved their boats inland.[27] Officials in Mississippi suggested that about 100,000?people evacuate the coastal counties.[28] Shelters were opened in Hancock and Harrison counties, though only 68?people went to a shelter in the former.[29] Gambling ships were moved into harbors and inland canals. Two run-offs for special legislative elections scheduled for August 25 were postponed.[28]\\r\\nIn Louisiana, Governor Edwin Edwards declared a state of emergency.[27] About 1.25?million people evacuated from the central and southeast Louisiana,[1] while approximately 60,000?others fled parishes in southwest Louisiana.[30] A mandatory evacuation from Grand Isle was ordered by Mayor Andy Valence and the city council.[31] In New Orleans, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy ordered the evacuation of about 200,000?residents in the low-lying areas of the city.[32] Nine shelters were opened in the city, which were occupied by thousands of people.[28] In response to computer simulations showing that storm surge from a tropical cyclone like Hurricane Andrew could over-top the levees, workers closed 111?floodgates.[32] The Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport closed, with jumbo jets being flown to other airports. A total of 250?members of the Louisiana National Guard patrolled the streets during the storm. The Red Cross assisted with opening a shelter at the University of Southwest Louisiana's Cajundome in Lafayette, equipped to handle about 2,000?people.[28]\\r\\nIn Texas, about 250,000?people evacuated Orange and Jefferson counties.[1] Galveston City Manager Doug Matthews advised residents to develop an evacuation plan in the event that the city chose to call for evacuations.[33] The city later decided against ordering an evacuation.[34] School was canceled on August 25 for Beaumont, Port Arthur, and other areas of central Jefferson County,[33] while schools were closed in Dickinson, High Island, Hitchcock, La Marque, Santa Fe, and Texas City on August 26. College of the Mainland, Galveston College, and Texas A&M University at Galveston were also closed.[35] Emergency management crews in Corpus Christi began testing emergency generators and severe weather gear.[33] The Comal County chapter of the Red Cross placed their disaster alert teams on standby and ready to respond if the hurricane threatened the Corpus Christi area.[36]\\r\\nThough Andrew was a small tropical cyclone for most of its lifespan, it caused extreme damage, especially in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana. The vast majority of the damage was as a result of extremely high winds, although a few tornadoes spawned by Andrew caused considerable damage in Louisiana. Throughout the areas affected, almost 177,000?people were left homeless. Outside of the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, effects were widespread, although damage was minimal. Overall, $26.5?billion in losses and 65?fatalities were attributed to Andrew,[1] with some estimates ranging as high as $34?billion.[40] Andrew was the costliest hurricane in U.S. history at the time, but is now fifth following hurricanes Katrina (2005), Sandy (2012), Harvey (2017), and Ike (2008).[41]\\r\\nIn the Bahamas, Andrew produced hurricane-force winds in North Eleuthera, New Providence, North Andros, Bimini, and the Berry Islands.[42] The storm first struck North Eleuthera,[43] where it produced a high storm surge.[17] At a small village in the northwestern portion of the island, more than half of the houses were destroyed and the rest of the buildings sustained minor to major damage. One person drowned from the surge in Lower Bogue, Eleuthera, and two others died in The Bluff. On Current Island, the hurricane destroyed 24 of the 30 houses.[44] Harbour Island, near Eleuthera, reported wind gusts of 138?mph (222?km/h) ÿ the strongest gust speed observed in the Bahamas during Andrew's passage.[1] News reports indicated severe damage to 36 houses on Harbor Island.[45]\\r\\nAndrew produced several tornadoes in the area.[46] At the capital city of Nassau, sustained winds reached 92?mph (148?km/h), while gusts up to 115?mph (185?km/h) were reported.[1] Only minor damage occurred in Nassau, according to the Bahamas Red Cross,[45] but on the private island of Cat Cay, many expensive homes sustained heavy damage.[47] Much of the northwestern Bahamas received damage,[46] with estimated monetary losses reaching $250?million.[1] A total of 800 houses were destroyed, leaving 1,700 people homeless. Additionally, the storm caused severe damage to the sectors of transport, communications, water, sanitation, agriculture, and fishing.[45] Four deaths in the country were attributed to the hurricane, of which three were direct;[1] the indirect fatality was due to heart failure during the passage of the storm.[44][nb 4]\\r\\nOverall, Andrew caused about $25.3?billion in damage in Florida,[1] making it the costliest hurricane to hit the state.[49] Almost all of the damage in Florida was caused by strong winds.[1] Of the 44?deaths attributed to the storm, 15?were direct fatalities, while 29?were indirectly caused by the storm. It was later noted that if Andrew had been slightly larger or had made landfall a few miles further north, it would have significantly affected Miami and Fort Lauderdale, which would have resulted in an even higher damage and death toll.[1] An analysis by the American Meteorological Society indicated that unlike most hurricanes, wind damage from Andrew was mostly north of the geometric center and occurred primarily on the eastern edge of the storm.[50] Some officials in Florida considered Andrew the worst storm in the state since the Labor Day hurricane in 1935.[51] The storm surge from Andrew caused more than $500?million in losses to boats and buildings.[1][52] At the height of the storm, more than 1.4?million people lost electricity and another 150,000?were without telephone service.[53] It is estimated that throughout Florida, the storm damaged 101,241?homes and destroyed approximately 63,000?others ÿ the vast majority in Dade County ÿ with about 175,000?people rendered homeless.[1][54] In addition to homes, the storm damaged or destroyed 82,000?businesses, 32,900 acres (13,300?ha) of farmland, 31?public schools, 59?health facilities/hospitals, 9,500?traffic signals, 3,300?mi (5,300?km) of power lines, and 3,000?watermains.[53] Approximately 20?million cubic yards (15?million m3) of debris left by the storm were disposed of.[55]\\r\\nTides were generally between 4 to 6?ft (1.2 to 1.8?m) above normal in the Biscayne Bay area, though near the Burger King International Headquarters, tides reached as high as 16.9?ft (5.2?m) above normal. Storm surge on the west coast was widespread but generally light, with a peak height of 6?ft (1.8?m) in Everglades City and Goodland. Strong winds from the storm were confined to a relatively small area, stretching from Key Largo to the Miami Beach area. A house near Perrine initially reported a wind gust of 212?mph (341?km/h) before the structure and instrument were destroyed; this measurement was reduced to 177?mph (285?km/h), after wind-tunnel testing at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University of the same type of anemometer revealed a 16.5% error. Several other anemometers measuring the highest wind speeds on land were destroyed or failed. At the National Hurricane Center building in Coral Gables, sustained winds of 115?mph (185?km/h) and gusts to 164?mph (264?km/h) were measured before the anemometer failed. The highest sustained wind speed for the storm was 146?mph (235?km/h), recorded at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station, before instruments also failed there. In Key Largo, a 13-minute wind speed of 114?mph (183?km/h) was reported. Tropical storm force winds reached as far north as West Palm Beach. On the west coast of Florida, sustained winds remained just below tropical storm force on Marco Island, though a wind gust of 100?mph (160?km/h) was reported in Collier County. Rainfall was generally light, possibly as a result of the storm's relatively fast movement.[1] Overall, precipitation from Andrew peaked at nearly 14?in (360?mm) in western Dade County. Heavy rainfall in other areas was sporadic, with precipitation reported as far north as Central Florida.[13]\\r\\nAlthough effects from Andrew were catastrophic, the extent of damage was limited mainly from Kendall to Key Largo due to the small wind field of the storm. The hurricane destroyed 90% of mobile homes in the county, including 99% of mobile homes in Homestead.[1] At the Homestead Air Force Base, most of the 2,000?buildings on the base were severely damaged or rendered unusable.[56] Damage to the base was extensive enough that it was recommended for closure.[57] Nearby, in the small town of Florida City, over 120?homes were demolished and 700?others were damaged, while a number of other buildings were damaged beyond repair, including City Hall.[58] Further north, damage to poorly constructed homes in communities such as Country Walk and Saga Bay resembled that of an F3 tornado, as winds in the area were estimated to have ranged from 130 to 150?mph (210 to 240?km/h), below the threshold for an F3 tornado.[59] Four of the five condominiums at Naranja Lakes were destroyed.[60] The Cutler Ridge Mall suffered severe wind and water damage; after the storm, significant looting was reported at that location.[61] More than 50?streets were blocked by fallen trees and power lines.[62] Agriculture suffered extensively as well, with an 85% loss to fruit crops such as avocados, limes, and mangoes. Crop damage in Dade County totaled about $509?million.[63] The county suffered the vast majority of the damage from the hurricane, totaling approximately $25?billion. Andrew left at least 40?deaths in the county, 15?direct and 25?indirect.[1]\\r\\nElsewhere, effects were relatively minimal, except in Broward, Monroe, and Collier counties. In Broward County, on the north side of the storm's path, impact in several municipalities was primarily limited to downed trees, several of which fell onto roads and power lines. In Pembroke Park, one of the worst impacted cities in the county, approximately 260?mobile homes were damaged. Storm surge left coastal flooding in some areas, especially along state roads A1A and 858.[64] Property damage reached about $100?million and three fatalities were reported in Broward County.[1] In Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park, more than 25% of trees were damaged or destroyed, including one-fourth of the royal palms and one-third of the pine trees in the former.[65] In addition to the damage at Everglades National Park, effects in Monroe County were significant, especially in the Upper Florida Keys. Strong winds damaged billboards, awnings, commercial signs, several boats, planes, trees,[26] and 1,500?homes, with 300?of those becoming uninhabitable.[22] Damage in that county was about $131?million.[1] In Collier County, to the north of the storm's path, sustained winds up to 98?mph (158?km/h) were observed in Chokoloskee.[66] Storm surge flooded low-lying areas, particularly in Goodland, Everglades City, and Marco Island. Many boats were damaged or destroyed by the rough seas and strong winds.[67] The storm destroyed 80?mobile homes and severely damaged 400?others.[68] Property damage in the county reached about $30?million.[1]\\r\\nAfter hitting Florida, Andrew moved across the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall about 23?mi (37?km) west-southwest of Morgan City in south-central Louisiana; at landfall, the maximum sustained winds were 115?mph (185?km/h). The highest sustained wind speed observed was 96?mph (154?km/h), while a wind gust as strong as 120?mph (190?km/h) was recorded; both measurements were taken at the fire station in Berwick. As it moved ashore, the hurricane produced storm tides of at least 8?ft (2.4?m) above normal, causing flooding along the coast from Vermilion Bay to Lake Borgne.[1] Off Louisiana, a group of six fishermen from Alabama drowned.[29] Heavy rains accompanied the storm's passage through the state, peaking at 11.02?in (280?mm) in Robert.[1] River flooding was also reported, with the Tangipahoa River in Robert cresting at 3.8?ft (1.2?m) above flood stage.[69] Before making landfall, Andrew spawned an F3 tornado in LaPlace, which killed two people and injuring 32.[1][69] The tornado was on the ground for about 10?minutes, during which it damaged or destroyed 163?structures, leaving 60?families homeless.[69] Collectively, 14?tornadoes were reported in the parishes of Ascension, Iberville, Pointe Coupee, and Avoyelles, as well as in Baton Rouge.[1][70]\\r\\nAlong the Louisiana coastline, impact largely resembled that of a Category 2 hurricane. Damage was heaviest in St. Mary Parish, about 32?mi (51?km) east of where Andrew made landfall. Twenty-six schools were impacted, with damage totaling $2.6?million. Berwick High School, sheltering about 2,000?people, was deroofed during the storm. Generally, single-family homes fared well, with most losing only roofing shingles, though others suffered severe damage after large trees fell on them. In Cypremort Point State Park, several mobile homes were destroyed.[71] Houses in Berwick, Morgan City, and Patterson suffered major damage. Throughout the parish, 1,367?dwellings were destroyed, 2,028?were severely damaged, and 4,770?others were impacted to a minor degree. Property damage alone in St. Mary Parish reached approximately $150?million. Iberia Parish was also among the most severely impacted parishes. Two schools collectively sheltering about 3,600?people in Jeanerette and New Iberia lost their roofs. One death occurred in the parish due to electrocution. A total of 407?residences were demolished, 2,528?others were extensively damaged, and 3,526?others were inflicted with minor damage. Overall, the parish suffered $125?million in property damage, while an additional $200?million in damage was inflicted on sugar crops.[70]\\r\\nAcross the state, the hurricane damaged 23,000?homes and destroyed 985?homes and 1,951?mobile homes; private property damage was estimated at $1?billion. The high winds destroyed large areas of sugar and soybean crops, estimated at $289?million in damage.[70] Strong winds also left at least 230,000?people without electricity.[72] During the storm's passage, upwelling occurred in the Atchafalaya Basin and Bayou Lafourche, killing 187?million freshwater fish. Damage to the fishing industry was estimated at $266?million. Overall, losses in the state of Louisiana reached approximately $1.56?billion.[70] A total of 17?deaths occurred in Louisiana, 8?directly and 9?from indirect causes.[1] At least 75?injuries were reported.[73]\\r\\nWhile Andrew was entering the Gulf of Mexico, oil companies evacuated hundreds of employees from offshore drilling platforms.[74] The storm damaged 241?oil and gas facilities and toppled 33?platforms off the coast of Louisiana,[75] causing significant disruptions in production. Additionally, 83?pipeline segments suffered damage to some degree. The oil industry lost about $12?million per day in the days following Andrew and $4?million daily by three weeks later.[75] Initially, a production loss of 240,000 to 270,000?barrels per day occurred ÿ approximately one-third of production throughout the Gulf of Mexico.[76] Overall, Hurricane Andrew caused about $500?million in damage to oil facilities.[1]\\r\\nAs Andrew moved ashore in Louisiana, its outer fringes produced a storm tide of about 1.3?ft (0.40?m) in Sabine Pass, Texas. Winds were generally light in the state, reaching 30?mph (48?km/h) in Port Arthur.[1] As Andrew crossed into Mississippi, 3?severe thunderstorm warnings, 21?tornado warnings, and 16?flood warnings were issued. Funnel clouds were observed near the path of the storm,[77] along with 26?tornadoes.[78] Structural damage was generally minimal, occurring from the tornadoes and severe thunderstorms. One tornado in Kemper County destroyed a mobile home, while another twister in Lauderdale County demolished a mobile home, damaged five other dwellings, and injured four people.[79] Additionally, a possible tornado damaged a home and two trailers in Lawrence County.[77] Strong winds knocked down trees in the southwestern portion of the state.[77] Much of Mississippi received 3 to 5?in (76 to 127?mm) of rain, while areas near the southwest corner of the state observed over 7?in (180?mm) of precipitation,[80] with a peak of 9.30?in (236?mm) at Sumrall.[81] Flooding was mostly limited to the inundation of minor roads and low-lying areas in several counties.[80]\\r\\nIn Alabama, precipitation amounts in the state peaked at 4.71?in (120?mm) in Aliceville.[81] The rainfall caused flooding in low-lying areas and creeks, covering a few county roads but not entering many houses or businesses.[80] Along the coast, the storm produced flooding and high tides.[29] Along Dauphin Island, high tides left severe beach erosion, with portions of the island losing up to 30?ft (9.1?m) of sand.[29] Three damaging tornadoes occurred in the state. The most damaging tornado was spawned in Elmore County and moved from an area northeast of Montgomery to the south of Wetumpka and briefly lifted during its 0.5?mi (0.80?km) track. The tornado destroyed 2?homes and damaged 18?homes, 1?mobile home, 2?barns, and 1?vehicle. One person was injured by the twister.[70] Sustained winds in the state were below tropical storm force, though a wind gust of 41 mph (67 km/h) was observed in Huntsville.[1] Although 48 counties in Alabama reported wind damage, impact across the state was generally minor.[29]\\r\\nTropical storm force wind gusts and damaging tornadoes extended eastward into Georgia. Several counties in the northwest and west-central portions of the state reported downed trees and tree limbs and fallen power lines, causing scattered power outages, but structural damage was generally minor. In Carroll County, several dwellings and barns were damaged, with one mobile home destroyed. At the Columbus Metropolitan Airport, buildings, billboards, and signs were damaged. Additionally, a tornado in Floyd County near Rome snapped and uprooted several trees, damaged several fences and homes, and flipped over a trailer, tossing it on top of four cars.[70] Monetary losses in the state reached about $100,000.[1] In Tennessee, thunderstorm winds and tornadoes associated with Andrew downed trees and power lines, but caused little overall impact to homes and buildings. Similarly, in North Carolina, thunderstorm winds toppled trees and power lines at a number of locations in the mountainous areas of the state, especially in Avery County. Rainfall from Andrew spread across the southeastern United States along the Appalachian Mountains corridor; totals of over 5?in (125?mm) were reported where Georgia and South Carolina meet North Carolina.[13] In West Virginia, the remnants of Andrew combined with a cold front to produce 1.5 to 2.5?in (38 to 64?mm) of rain over portions of the state, causing flooding in areas of Morgantown with poor drainage. The remnants of Andrew also spawned several tornadoes in Maryland. A tornado in Howard County damaged several homes, some extensively. The twister also tossed and wrecked a recreational vehicle and its trailer, downed trees, and flattened cornfields.[70] Precipitation continued along the path of Andrew's remnants through the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley, with precipitation measured as far north as Upstate New York.[13]\\r\\nAfter the season had ended, the World Meteorological Organization's RA IV Hurricane Committee retired the name Andrew from the list of future names for Atlantic tropical cyclones and replaced it with Alex.[82][83] The name Andrew will never be used again for another Atlantic Hurricane.\\r\\nInitially, the Bahamas National Disaster Coordinator believed that foreign aid was not required, but shortly after the storm, the Government of the United Kingdom began distributing blankets, food, ice, and water. HMS?Cardiff, a Royal Navy Type 42 destroyer, was the operational guard ship at the time and assisted in relief operations in and around the Gregorytown area.[17][45] In addition, assistance came from Canada, Japan, and the United States, as well as the United Nations. The American Red Cross delivered 100?tents, 100?rolls of plastic sheeting, and 1,000?cots.[45] Rebuilding began quickly on the hardest hit islands. However, trees and vegetation were expected to take years to recover. Despite reconstruction efforts and the small number of resort lodgings affected (around 2%), officials expected a 10%ÿ20% decline in tourism.[47] The Bahamian Government, observing that their response mechanisms were not sufficient, reformed the National Emergency and Management Agency.[84]\\r\\nAfter assessing the devastation in Florida and Louisiana, U.S. President George H. W. Bush initially proposed a $7.1?billion aid package to provide disaster benefits, small-business loans, agricultural recovery, food stamps, and public housing for victims of Hurricane Andrew.[85] After the House of Representatives appropriated aid to victims of Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii and Typhoon Omar in Guam, the cost was later increased to $11.1?billion. The bill, which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time, was passed by Congress as House Resolution?5620 on September?18,[86] and signed into law by President Bush on September?23.[87] The state of Florida alone received $9?billion through the disaster relief bill.[88]\\r\\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was criticized for its slow response in both Florida and Louisiana. Even a month prior to Andrew, the House Committee on Appropriations ÿ which oversees the budget for FEMA ÿ released a report calling the agency a \\"political dumping ground\\" and a \\"turkey farm\\" due to its \\"weak, inexperienced leaders\\". Congressman S. William Green of New York, a member of the Appropriations Committee, stated that he believed the agency learned little from its botched response to Hurricane Hugo in 1989. However, Green also criticized local officials for expecting \\"them [FEMA] to come and run the whole show\\". Some FEMA officials responded that it was impossible to respond as they had been requested while also continuing to provide aid for the Los Angeles riots. FEMA spokesman Grant Peterson stated, \\"24 hours is not reasonable to expect to have all the resources of the federal government landing in the middle of a disaster.\\"[89]\\r\\nIn Florida, President Bush assessed damage in areas south of Miami with Florida Governor Lawton Chiles.[51] The president quickly declared the region a disaster area, which provided public assistance to victims of the storm in Broward, Collier, Dade, and Monroe Counties.[90] Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay flew over the impact area and described the scene as looking \\"like a war zone\\".[91] Governor Chiles considered asking the Florida State Legislature to raise taxes, stating that \\"No matter how much Congress appropriates to repair damage from Hurricane Andrew, the state will face a substantial cleanup bill\\".[85] Instead of raising taxes, Chiles signed a bill into law on December?17 that created a three-year reserve fund for losses to uninsured businesses and homes, as well as government and school buildings and functions. Additionally, the bill allowed South Floridians to keep an estimated $500?million in sales tax generated by rebuilding efforts.[92]\\r\\nCrime, especially looting and theft, rose sharply in the areas south of Miami immediately after Andrew. Reports indicate that merchandise was stolen at damaged or destroyed shopping centers in southern Dade County. Additionally, looting occurred in neighborhoods severely affected by the storm, even in homes where few possessions remained.[60][93] Initially, the slow response of federal aid prompted Dade County Emergency Management Director Kate Hale to famously exclaim at a nationally televised news conference, \\"Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one? They keep saying we're going to get supplies. For God's sake, where are they?\\" Almost immediately, President Bush promised, \\"Help is on the way,\\" and mobile kitchens, food, and tents, along with over 20,000 units from the Florida Army National Guard (124th Infantry Regiment from Florida); the 24th Infantry Division from Fort Stewart, the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, and the 10th Mountain Division from Fort Drum.[94][95] In order to provide temporary housing for the homeless, military personnel initially set up a total of five tent cities in Florida City and Homestead,[96] while a sixth tent city was opened at the Miccosukee Indian Reservation shortly after Labor Day weekend.[97] The Government of Canada dispatched a team 90?military engineers to repair community centers, hospitals, and schools. Additionally, a crew of 300?military personnel were sent to Miami via the HMCS Protecteur to assist American relief teams.[98]\\r\\nThe storm struck Florida in the midst of 1992 presidential election campaign. A poll conducted by CBS News in September showed that 65% of Dade County residents approved of Bush's handling of the disaster, while 61% of residents approved statewide. Despite the support of Bush's response and his proposal to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base, he benefited little politically and trailed 48%ÿ42% against Bill Clinton in another poll taken in September. Additionally, 75% of voters in Dade County and 82% of Floridians overall stated that the president's actions in response to Andrew would not impact their vote in November.[99] Bush went on to carry the state of Florida, but by a margin of only 1.89%.[100] The hurricane also impacted Governor Chiles politically. The state's response to the storm was perceived as poor, sinking Chiles' approval rating to 22%, while his disapproval rating rose to 76%. However, Chiles was able to recover prior to the 1994 gubernatorial election.[101]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the storm, extensive psychological effects were documented. Difficulty during clean-up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and a spike in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The cases of PTSD primarily impacted children. A sampling of 378?adolescents by the University of South Carolina's Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for PTSD.[102] Dozens of children in the area attempted suicide, while counselors reported that between 50 and 60?children discussed killing themselves between December?1992 and January?1993.[103] A panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the University of Miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of PTSD.[104] Within six months, the circumstances related to the aftermath of Andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicides.[105]\\r\\nAlthough proposals to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base were initially rejected,[57] the United States Department of Defense eventually expended over $100?million to begin repairs. Unsalvageable buildings were demolished. Reconstruction then began on a Florida Air National Guard tower, air traffic control tower, and maintenance hangars. Next, the rebuilding of communications, medical, security facility, vehicle maintenance, and wing headquarters buildings began. On March?5, 1994, the base reopened as Homestead Air Reserve Base.[106] Prior to Andrew, the base employed approximately 6,500?military personnel and 1,000?civilians and annually added about $450?million to the local economy.[107][108] After its reopening, Major Bobby D'Angelo expected the base to annually contribute less than half of that ÿ between $180?million and $200?million.[108] The city of Homestead spent about $6?million on rebuilding the Homestead Sports Complex. Despite this, the Cleveland Indians, fearing the relocation of their more affluent fans, moved their spring training location to Chain of Lakes Park in Winter Haven.[109][110] As homes were being rebuilt, FEMA provided free temporary mobile homes for 3,501?families and financial assistance to more than 40,000?other families for staying in hotel rooms, paying rent, and repairing homes.[111] Nearly two years after Andrew, about 70% of homes in Homestead that were damaged or destroyed were repaired or rebuilt. Additionally, of the homes destroyed or severely damaged throughout Dade County, 36,000?had been restored by July 1994.[112]\\r\\nMore than 930,000?policyholders in South Florida lost coverage after 11?insurance companies went bankrupt, caused by more than 600,000?insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, in an effort to restore adequate insurance capacity.[113] Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.[114]\\r\\nIn July?1996, Governor Chiles established the Florida Building Codes Study Commission, with the purpose of assessing the building codes at the time, as well as enacting improvements and reform to the system. The commission study indicated that building codes and regulations were developed, amended, and administered by over 400?local jurisdictions and state agencies.[115] The Florida Building Code was established in 1998 and put into effect by 2002.[116] It phased out local laws and regulations and replaced them with universal statewide building codes. After hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne in 2004, a study conducted by the University of Florida in the following year noted that \\"Homes built under the new Florida Building Code that became effective in 2002 sustained less damage on average than those built between 1994 and 2001.\\" A report by the Florida Legislature in 2006 after hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, and Wilma in 2005 came to a similar conclusion, indicating that \\"they added further evidence that the Florida Building Code is working.\\"[117]\\r\\nThe hurricane also transformed the demographics of Dade County. A migration of mostly White families northward to Broward and Palm Beach County was ongoing, but accelerated after Andrew.[118] Many of these families had used the money they received from insurance claims to relocate.[119] The population growth was especially noticeable in southwestern Broward County, where land development was pushed \\"years ahead of schedule\\".[118] Similar migration occurred within the Jewish community. Although there are areas of Dade County that still have significant Jewish populations, many Jews resettled to Coral Springs, west Fort Lauderdale, Hallandale Beach, Plantation, and Tamarac in Broward County and Boca Raton and West Palm Beach in Palm Beach County.[120] The county had a net loss of about 36,000?people in 1992, while Broward and Palm Beach counties gained about 17,000 and 2,300?Dade County residents, respectively.[109] By 2001, 230,710?people had moved from Dade County to Broward County, while 29,125?Dade County residents had moved to Palm Beach County. However, as Broward County became more crowded, 100,871?people relocated from Broward County to Palm Beach County.[121] Consequently, the Hispanic population in south Dade County climbed rapidly.[119] In Homestead, for example, the Latino population increased from 30% to 45% between 1990 and 2000.[122]\\r\\nDuring the storm, a facility housing Burmese pythons was destroyed, allowing many of them to escape into the Everglades. Although Burmese pythons ÿ native to Southeast Asia ÿ had been sighted in Everglades National Park since the 1980s, the destruction of this facility contributed significantly to the establishment of breeding populations in Florida. Due to rapid reproduction and ability to prey on many species,[123] the population of Burmese pythons exploded, with possibly as many as 300,000 in the Everglades alone.[124] Efforts have been made to curb the thriving population of these invasive snakes, including a ban on importation of the species to the United States since January?2012 and increased regulations on ownership of a boa constrictor or python.[125][126]\\r\\nOn August 26, George H. W. Bush toured devastated areas of Louisiana with Governor Edwin Edwards.[127] President Bush remarked, \\"The destruction from this storm goes beyond anything we have known in recent years,\\" but noted that damage was less severe than in Florida. After his visit to Louisiana, President Bush declared only Terrebonne Parish as a disaster area,[72] but later included 34 other parishes under this declaration.[128] FEMA initially opened five field offices throughout Louisiana. These centers allowed residents to submit applications for aid.[129] After Franklin mayor Sam Jones and Congressman Billy Tauzin criticized FEMA for failing to open a field office in Franklin, FEMA promised to do so. In the first few days following the storm, Louisiana National Guard members and local residents worked to remove debris such as downed trees, roofing shingles, and torn aluminum siding. The state National Guard also dispatched water purification units and tanks with filled potable water.[130] About 1,300?National Guardsmen were deployed to southern Louisiana.[131]\\r\\nIn early September, officials announced that 1,400?mobile homes, homes, and apartments would become available to residents whose dwellings became uninhabitable.[131] House Resolution 5620 also included disaster aid to the state of Louisiana.[86][87] In early December, the Small Business Administration (SBA) approved $33.2?million worth of low-interest loans for repairs to homes and businesses. By then, FEMA had received about 43,600 applications for aid, while approving $35.9?million in grants to over 18,000 households that were ineligible for loans from the SBA or were uninsured. In addition to the mobile homes already provided, FEMA spent $22.6 million on disaster housing.[132]","input":"What was the death toll for hurricane andrew?"},{"output":"October 18, 2001","context":"1999 West End2000 Toronto2000 US Tour2001 Melbourne2001 Broadway2002 North America Tour2002 Hamburg2002 Tokyo2003 Las Vegas2003 Utrecht2004 Seoul2004 International Tour2004 Stuttgart2004 Madrid2005 Stockholm2006 Antwerp2006 Moscow2007 Essen2008 Film2009 Oslo2009 Mexico City2009 Netherlands Tour2009 Australia Tour2010 South Africa Tour2010 Milan2010 Copenhagen2010 Paris2010 S?o Paulo2011 Shanghai2012 Buenos Aires2012 Moscow2013 Stuttgart2014 New Zealand Tour*2014 Vienna2014 Las Vegas2014 Budapest*2014 Helsinki2014 Royal Caribbean2014 Prague*2015 Warsaw*2015 Belgrade*2015 Zagreb*2015 Ljubljana*2015 Barcelona2016 Seoul2016 Reykjavk*2016 Panama City*2016 UK Tour2016 Lima*2016 Tartu*2016 Athens*2017 Italy Tour*2017 Bratislava*2017 Australian Tour*2018 Santiago*2018 Helsinki2018 Sequel film2018 Bucharest*2018 Germany Tour2018 Sofia*2018 Utrecht\\r\\n\\r\\nMamma Mia! (promoted as Benny Andersson & Bj?rn Ulvaeus' Mamma Mia!) is a jukebox musical written by British playwright Catherine Johnson, based on the songs of ABBA composed by Benny Andersson and Bj?rn Ulvaeus, former members of the band. The title of the musical is taken from the group's 1975 chart-topper \\"Mamma Mia\\".  Ulvaeus and Andersson, who composed the original music for ABBA, were involved in the development of the show from the beginning. Singer Anni-Frid Lyngstad has been involved financially in the production and she has also been present at many of the premieres around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical includes such hits as \\"Super Trouper\\", \\"Lay All Your Love on Me\\", \\"Dancing Queen\\", \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\\", \\"Take a Chance on Me\\", \\"Thank You for the Music\\", \\"Money, Money, Money\\", \\"The Winner Takes It All\\", \\"Voulez-Vous\\", \\"SOS\\" and the title track. Over 60 million people have seen the show, which has grossed $2 billion worldwide since its 1999 debut. A film adaptation starring Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Amanda Seyfried, Christine Baranski, Stellan Skarsg?rd and Julie Walters was released in July 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2018, the show has productions in London's West End, where it is the seventh longest-running show in West End history, as well as various international productions. Its Broadway incarnation closed in September 2015 after a 14-year run, making it the ninth longest-running show in Broadway history.\\r\\n\\r\\nMamma Mia! is based on the songs of ABBA, a Swedish pop/dance group active from 1972 to 1982 and one of the most popular international pop groups of all time, topping the charts again and again in Europe, North and South America and Australia.  Following the premiere of the musical in London in 1999, ABBA Gold topped the charts in the United Kingdom again.  This musical was the brainchild of producer Judy Craymer.  She met songwriters Bj?rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson in 1983 when they were working with Tim Rice on Chess.[1]  It was the song \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" that suggested to her the theatrical potential of their pop songs.[1]  The songwriters were not enthusiastic, but they were not completely opposed to the idea.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, Craymer commissioned Catherine Johnson to write the book for the musical. In 1998, Phyllida Lloyd became the director for the show.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical opened in the West End at the Prince Edward Theatre on April 6, 1999, and transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre on June 9, 2004, where it played until September 2012, when it moved to the Novello Theatre.[2] Directed by Phyllida Lloyd with choreography by Anthony Van Laast, the original cast featured Siobhan McCarthy, Lisa Stokke, and Hilton McRae.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the musical's Broadway engagement, it opened in Toronto at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in May 2000, where it played for five years. Its US debut was in San Francisco, California, at the Orpheum Theatre from November 17, 2000 to February 17, 2001,[5][6] moving next to Los Angeles, California, at the Shubert Theatre from February 26, 2001 to May 12, 2001,[7] and finally to Chicago, Illinois, at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from May 13, 2001 to August 12, 2001.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical opened on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on October 18, 2001, after beginning previews on October 5. The director is Phyllida Lloyd with choreography by Anthony Van Laast. As of October 2017, it is the ninth longest-running Broadway show and the longest-running jukebox musical in Broadway history. On April 18, 2013, it was announced that Mamma Mia! would transfer from its home at the Winter Garden Theatre to the Broadhurst Theatre later that year to make way for the musical adaptation of Rocky.[9] The show played its final performance at the Winter Garden Theatre on October 19, 2013 and began performances at the Broadhurst Theatre on November 2, 2013.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was announced on April 9, 2015 that the show would close on September 5, 2015.[11] On April 21, 2015, it was then announced that show would play an additional week and would instead close on September 12, 2015.  Mamma Mia! played 5,773 performances on Broadway before closing.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nMamma Mia! has been played in more than 50 countries in all 6 continents, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Latvia, Lituania, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and United States, and has been translated into 26 languages: German, Japanese, Dutch, Korean, Spanish, Swedish, Russian, Norwegian, Italian, Danish, French, Portuguese, Mandarin, Hungarian, Czech, Polish, Serbian, Croatian, Slovene, Icelandic, Estonian, Greek, Slovak, Finnish, Romanian, and Bulgarian. Over 60 million people have seen the show worldwide and it has set the record for premiering in more cities faster than any other musical in history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first city to produce the show after London was Toronto, where it ran from May 22, 2000 to May 22, 2005, being the North America premiere of Mamma Mia!.[13]  The original cast included Louise Pitre as Donna and Tina Maddigan as Sophie, who both of them later reprised their roles in first US Tour and Broadway premiere.\\r\\n\\r\\nMamma Mia! played in Las Vegas, opening at the Mandalay Bay in February 2003 and closing on January 4, 2009.[14][15] In June 2005, Mamma Mia! played its 1000th performance in Las Vegas, becoming the longest-running West End/Broadway musical in Las Vegas. The clothes and scenarios from this production are now used in Brazil.[16] The show returned to Las Vegas on May 16, 2014 at the Tropicana Hotel & Casino, but announced its closing soon after on July 22.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American tour started in Providence, Rhode Island in February 28, 2002 and closed in St. Louis, Missouri in July 30, 2017, after more than 4.000 performances.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first non-English version of the show debuted in Hamburg at the Operettenhaus, where it ran from November 3, 2002 to September 8, 2007. With the productions of Stuttgart (2004) and Essen (2007), Mamma Mia! became the first major musical to play concurrently in three German cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show has had (and in some cases, still has) permanent productions in London, Toronto, Melbourne, New York, Hamburg, Tokyo (later transferred to Osaka, Fukuoka and Nagoya), Las Vegas, Utrecht, Seoul (later transferred to Seongnam and Daegu), Stuttgart, Madrid (later transferred to Barcelona), Stockholm (later transferred to Gothenburg), Antwerp, Moscow, Essen, Berlin, Oslo, Mexico City, Milan (later transferred to Rome), Copenhagen (later transferred to Aarhus), Paris, S?o Paulo, Shanghai, Buenos Aires, Vienna and Helsinki.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its premiere in Dublin on September 9, 2004 (with Helen Hobson as Donna) the international tour has visited more than 85 cities in 38 countries and has been seen by 5 million people.  In addition there have been several touring productions worldwide, including Australia/Asia (2002ÿ2005), Australia (2009ÿ2010), China, France (2012ÿ2013), Germany, Japan, Netherlands (2009ÿ2010), North America (2002ÿ2017), Spain (2009ÿ2011 and 2016ÿ2017), South Africa (2010ÿ2011), South Korea, United Kingdom (2016ÿ2018), and United States (2000ÿ2001).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch actress Lone van Roosendaal has played Donna in three different countries: Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Original Danish Tivoli Copenhagen Cast it was actually Kristine Yde Eriksen as Sophie and Nadia Barbara Abrahamsen as Ali. But when the production moved to Aarhus took Stine Louise Henriksen over for Kristine Yde Eriksen as Sophie and Nadin Reiness took over for Nadia Barbara Abrahamsen as Ali. Stine Louise Henriksen was actually Kristine's understudy in Tivoli, Copenhagen and so was Nadin Reiness for Nadia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South African tour, conducted at the Artscape Theatre in Cape Town on August 11, 2010 and 3 months later at The Teatro, Montecasino in Johannesburg, featured an all local cast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese production opened on July 11, 2011 at the Shanghai Grand Theatre and closed on January 18, 2012 at Shanghai Cultural Square after a small tour, marking the first time that a blockbuster contemporary Western musical were presented in Chinese in Shanghai (there was a previous Chinese production of Beauty and the Beast in Beijing in 1999). It was seen by 250,000 people across six venues, with a total of 190 performances. Shadow Zen played the role of Donna.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 24, 2012, Mamma Mia! opened in Manila at the Main Theater of the Cultural Center of the Philippines as part of the international Tour. The show was originally set to stay only for a week but with the positive response, the organisers decided that it would play until February 19, 2012.[19] The show features Sara Poyzer as Donna Sheridan and Charlotte Wakefield as Sophie. The cast also included Kate Graham (Tanya), Jenny Dale (Rosie) and David Roberts (Sky).[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nA New Zealand tour production of Mamma Mia! opened at the Auckland Civic Theatre on March 4, 2014, featuring an all new set design by John Harding. International theatre star Deliah Hannah played Donna, and popular New Zealand entertainment icon Jackie Clark plays Rosie. The NZ tour visited 11 cities in 2014ÿ2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical is performed on sailings of Royal Caribbean's Quantum of the Seas and Allure of the Seas. Unlike other cruise ship performances of musicals, the show is performed in its entirety.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, the musical had its premiere on December 12, 2014.  Czech is the seventeenth language in which the musical was performed. At the date of the premiere a record 70,000 tickets were sold.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 21, 2015, the musical premiered in Warsaw, Poland at Roma Musical Theatre.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Belgrade, Serbia ÿ Terazije Theatre (Pozori?te na Terazijama) premiere was on March 27, 2015.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 15, 2015 in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, premiere of Slovene production took place in Kri?anke Outdoor Theatre as a part of Ljubljana Summer Festival (Poletni festival Ljubljana).[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 18, 2016, Mamma Mia! opened for the first time in Panama City, Panama, at the Anayansi Theatre in the Atlapa Convention Centre, directed by  Aaron Zebede.\\r\\n[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 27, 2016 the first regional production opened at the Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 31 August 2016, it was announced that the musical would once again tour Australia as a new, non-replica production to be directed by Gary Young. The premier was held in Canberra in November 2017 before continuing on a 1-year national tour to Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Melbourne and finally Adelaide.[27] The cast of 30 included: Sarah Morrison as Sophie, Natalie O'Donnell as Donna, Jayde Westaby as Tanya, Alicia Gardiner as Rose, Ian Stenlake as Sam, Phillip Lowe as Harry, Josef Ber as Bill and Stephen Mahy as Sky.[28] The production was nominated for the following Helpmann Awards: Best Musical, Best Choreography (Tom Hodgson), Best Actress (Natalie O'Donnell) and Best Actor (Ian Stenlake).[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom July 28, 2017 to July 30, 2017, Mamma Mia! was performed at the Hollywood Bowl.

She wants her father to walk her down the aisle (\\"Prologue\\") but doesn't know who he is. Sophie discovers her mother's old diary and finds entries which describe intimate dates with three men (Sam Carmichael, Bill Austin [Anderson in the film version], and Harry Bright) (\\"Honey, Honey\\").  Sophie believes one of these men is her father and, three months before her nuptials, sends each an invitation to her wedding, writing in her mother's name, Donna, without letting her unsuspecting mother know.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day before the wedding, Donna begins receiving guests at her taverna. The first to arrive are her long-term best friends, Tanya, a rich woman who has been married and divorced three times, and Rosie, an unmarried, carefree writer. The trio used to comprise a girl group called \\"Donna and the Dynamos\\". The three women catch up and talk about their lives (\\"Money, Money, Money\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that day, Sophie's three possible fathers arrive: Sam (an American architect), Harry (a British banker), and Bill (originally an Australian writer and adventurer, Swedish in the film, and currently American in New York and on tour). Sophie convinces them not to tell Donna that she invited them (\\"Thank You for the Music\\"). Donna is surprised to see her ex-lovers (\\"Mamma Mia\\") and leaves in tears. Donna, crying, explains to Tanya and Rosie the situation, and they cheer her up (\\"Chiquitita\\"). Tanya and Rosie try to convince Donna that she can still be the girl she once was (\\"Dancing Queen\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nSophie had hoped she would know her father the moment she saw him but is now only confused. She tries to tell her fianc, Sky, how she feels without confessing what she has done. Sky tells her he will be the only man she ever needs (\\"Lay All Your Love on Me\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Sophie's hen party, Donna and the Dynamos don their old costumes and perform a song, (\\"Super Trouper\\"). Sam, Bill, and Harry accidentally walk in on the party, and the guests persuade them to stay (\\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nSophie first pulls Sam out of the room to talk to him. After he asks why he is there, she is overcome with guilt and goes to talk to Harry, instead. But Harry asks if Sophie's father is at the party, and she tells him the whole truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, she draws Bill aside to talk with him. She learns that Bill has an aunt Sophia who left all her money to Donna's family. Bill learns that Donna built the taverna with money she inherited from a friend she lived with when Sophie was a baby; that friend was Bill's aunt. They both think this means he is her father.\\r\\n\\r\\nSophie asks Bill to walk her down the aisle, but Bill wants to discuss it first with Donna. This has been her secret, after all. But no one knows yet that even Donna does not know who the father is, because she slept with the three men in such swift succession. Sophie insists they must not tell Donna anything (\\"The Name of the Game\\") and finally, Bill agrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterward, everybody crashes the hen party (including the guys from the stag party). During the party, Sam pulls Sophie aside and tells her he has figured out why she invited him. He knows he is her father and promises to walk her down the aisle the next day. Then, Harry approaches Sophie, apologizing for being so slow on the uptake; he is also convinced that she is his daughter and promises to walk her down the aisle. Sophie leaves the party, hopelessly confused; she doesn't want to turn any of them down (\\"Voulez-Vous\\").\\r\\n\\r\\n(Entr'acte) Sophie's having a nightmare, involving her three possible fathers all fighting for the right to walk her down the aisle and wakes up despairing (\\"Under Attack\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nSophie's upset, and Donna assumes that Sophie wants to cancel the wedding and offers to handle all the details. Sophie's offended and vows that her children won't grow up not knowing who their father is. As Sophie storms out of the room, Sam enters and tries to tell Donna that Sophie may not be all she seems, but Donna won't listen (\\"One of Us\\"). She hates Sam; at the end of their affair, she said she never wanted to see him again.  But it seems that Sam was the man Donna cared about the most, and both of them wish they could go back to the start (\\"SOS\\"').\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beach, Harry asks Tanya what the father of the bride ought to be doing for Sophie's wedding. Tanya explains that for her part, her father gave her his advice and then paid. Pepper, one of the guys who works at Donna's taverna, makes advances to Tanya, but she rebuffs him (\\"Does Your Mother Know\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nSky finds out what Sophie has done in inviting Sam, Harry and Bill to the wedding. He accuses her of wanting a big white wedding only so that she can find out who her father is. He's very hurt that she kept this plan a secret from him. He storms off just as Sam walks in. Sam tries to give Sophie some fatherly advice by describing his failed marriage (\\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\\"), but Sophie isn't consoled.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry offers to Donna to pay for the wedding, and they reminisce about their fling (\\"Our Last Summer\\"). Sophie arrives and Donna helps her get dressed. She cannot believe her daughter is going to be a bride (\\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\"). Donna admits that her own mother disowned her when she learned that she was pregnant. They reconcile and Sophie asks her mother if she will walk her down the aisle. Sam arrives and tries to speak to Donna again, but she doesn't want to see him, and asks him to leave. He refuses, and a bitter confrontation ensues. Donna tells Sam that he broke her heart, presumably when she found out he was engaged (\\"The Winner Takes It All\\"). It emerges that the two still love each other dearly, albeit against Donna's better judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nRosie is making final preparations in the taverna when Bill arrives. He's upset because he has received a note that Donna will be walking Sophie down the aisle. Bill reaffirms his commitment to the single life, but Rosie has become attracted to him, and urges him to reconsider (\\"Take a Chance on Me\\"). They are about to have sex in the taverna, but the guests arrive, leaving Rosie quite stunned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding begins, with Donna walking Sophie down the aisle. Before the priest has a chance to begin the ceremonies, Donna acknowledges to everyone that Sophie's father is present. Sophie tells her mother that she knows about her father. Donna realizes that Sophie invited them to the wedding for that very reason. The issue of Sophie's parentage is left unsettled, as none of them have any idea whether they are actually her father. Everyone involved agrees that it does not matter which one of them her biological parent is, as Sophie loves all three and they are all happy to be \\"one-third of a father\\" and a part of her life at last. Finally, Harry, who has made frequent references to his \\"other half\\" throughout the show, is revealed to be in a committed gay relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, Sophie calls a halt to the proceedings. She isn't ready to get married and Sky agrees with Sophie about not getting married. Sam seizes his chance and proposes to Donna in order to prevent the wedding preparations from going to waste. He explains that he loved her, even when he left to get married. It is revealed that he called off the wedding with his fiance and came back to the island, only to be told that Donna was going out with another man (Bill). He went back, married his fiance and had children but he got divorced. Surprisingly, Donna accepts (\\"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\\"). In the end, Sam and Donna are married, and at the end of the night, Sophie and Sky depart on a round-the-world tour (\\"I Have a Dream\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter their final bows to the audience, the ensemble performs a reprise of \\"Mamma Mia\\". A reprise of \\"Dancing Queen\\" follows, during which Donna, Tanya, Rosie are revealed wearing brightly colored ABBA inspired costumes. The cast ends the finale with \\"Waterloo\\", during which Sam, Bill, and Harry join the rest of the cast onstage in brightly colored costumes that match the leading ladies. The Dynamos and the Dads often invite the audience to clap, dance, and sing along during the finale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEncore\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the preview period in London, the musical had the song \\"Summer Night City\\" just after the prologue. The \\"Summer Night City\\" scene was a wedding rehearsal and during the song, Ali, Lisa, Tanya, and Rosie arrived on the island. Now, part of the song is used as underscoring to connect the end of \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" and \\"Take a Chance on Me\\". You can also hear a couple of lines of \\"Summer Night City\\" in the 'Entr'acte' (the most noticeable line is: 'Time to breathe and time to live').\\r\\n\\r\\nDonna hums a few lines of \\"Fernando\\", when she repairs the doors of the taverna just before she sees her three former lovers. In the Mexican production Donna sings a few lines of ABBA's original Spanish version of the song.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the German production, Sky (Bernhard Forcher) sang a few lines of \\"King Kong Song\\" before starting \\"Lay All Your Love on Me\\". Niklas Riesbeck uses the same song in the Swedish production. Andrey Kozhan sang a few lines of Summer Night City in the Russian production. In the international tour version, Sky (David Roberts) sings a few lines of \\"She's My Kind of Girl\\", a Bj?rn & Benny song. In the 2015 International tour version, Sky (Justin Thomas) sings a few lines of \\"Dum Dum Diddle\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wedding march that is played as Sophie walks down the aisle is a slower arrangement of \\"Dancing Queen\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creators also intended to include \\"Just Like That\\", an unreleased ABBA song recorded in 1982. The song was apparently dropped just before the first public previews in March 1999, though it was listed in the program available during the preview period.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally the outro after the encore was a 5-minute instrumental medley (in the style of the Ouverture and Entr'Acte) featuring Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight), SOS, Voulez-Vous, Does Your Mother Know, Money, Money, Money and Dancing Queen. It was later replaced with the short Dancing Queen instrumental, still being used today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last three songs, performed as an encore/finale by the whole cast are: \\"Mamma Mia\\", \\"Dancing Queen\\" and \\"Waterloo\\". The version of \\"Mamma Mia\\" used in the encore/finale is sung by the Company. The finale song Mamma Mia has been extended in theatres where Donna and the Dynamos had to go downstairs for taking the stage lift in Dancing Queen. Then, during the intro of \\"Dancing Queen\\", Donna, Tanya and Rosie join the Company (as the girl-power band \\"Donna and the Dynamos\\", wearing ABBA's 1970s-style colorful and flashy costumes). Sam, Bill and Harry join them during Waterloo, wearing male versions of the girls' ABBA's costumes. The Encore is included on the 5th Anniversary Cast Recording (commemorating said anniversary for the Broadway production).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Brazilian production, all three songs from the encore/finale were kept in English. Though \\"Waterloo\\" was adapted into Brazilian Portuguese, this version was never used.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Russian production the song \\"Happy New Year\\" is sung at the encore on New Year holidays shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nMamma Mia! was adapted as a film, produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, written by Catherine Johnson directed by Phyllida Lloyd and with Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Bj?rn Ulvaeus, and Benny Andersson as executive producers. Meryl Streep stars as Donna Sheridan and Amanda Seyfried as Sophie and Pierce Brosnan as Sam Carmichael. The movie also features Christine Baranski, Dominic Cooper, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsg?rd and Julie Walters. It premiered July 18, 2008, in the US.  Most of the songs remained intact with the exceptions of \\"Under Attack\\", \\"One of Us\\", \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\\", and \\"Thank You for the Music\\". \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\\" was used as the wedding music and \\"Thank You for the Music\\" is sung during the second half of the end credits. The first half is occupied with a \\"Dancing Queen\\" reprise and \\"Waterloo\\", with a \\"Mamma Mia\\" reprise and \\"I Have a Dream\\" sung before the credits (though the latter is sung as Sophie mails the invitations at the start of the film). \\"When All Is Said and Done\\", a song not used in the musical, was added for the film sung by Sam, Donna, and the company. \\"Our Last Summer\\" was used earlier in the movie, with Sophie, Bill, Sam, and Harry singing it. \\"The Name of the Game\\", while filmed, was subsequently edited out of the film for the final cut.  The song is included in full on the motion picture soundtrack  ÿ an abbreviated version of the song and scene appear on the DVD/Blu-ray as a supplement. In addition, \\"Thank You for the Music\\" is used as a hidden track, and is performed by Amanda Seyfried.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sequel to the film titled Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was released in 2018. It tells the story of how Donna met each of the 3 men who are potentially Sophie's father. \\"One of Us\\" and \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\\" are both included in this film.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing its premier in Stockholm in 2016[34], Bj?rn Ulvaeus announced that this immersive theatrical and dining experience, inspired by  Mamma Mia!, will open at the O2 Arena in London in Spring 2019. The specially adapted venue will be set in a Greek taverna on the island of Skopelos and will feature live musicians and real Mediterranean food.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn any given day, there are at least seven performances of Mamma Mia! being performed around the globe.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 15, 2005, Mamma Mia! surpassed the original Broadway runs of The Sound of Music, The King and I, and Damn Yankees with 1,500 performances.[16]  On March 6, 2014, it surpassed Rent to become the 8th longest-running Broadway musical and 9th longest-running show of all time with 5,124 performances,[36][37] then surpassed Beauty and the Beast's 5,462 performances that same year, on December 14, to become Broadway's 7th longest-running musical and 8th longest-running show.[38] The Broadway run ended on September 12, 2015, with its 5,758th performance, and was passed two years later (August 16, 2017) by Wicked to move one spot down in the list of longest-running Broadway shows.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mamma Mia! opened in Russia, it received a very positive response.[40] As of January 2008, Mamma Mia! became the longest daily running show in the history of Russian theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nMamma Mia! does not only heighten a nostalgic and emotional reactions to the ABBA fans,[41] it has also been celebrated for its feminist overtones. The musical features strong female protagonists living in a strong female-power community.[42] The theme of single motherhood breaks the family stereotype of a child being raised by both parents by showing a different perspective of a family raised single-handedly by a mother, to show that there can still be happiness and love. Having Donna, her two good friends and her daughter, Sophie as the main strong female characters of the musical, it can be seen as an empowerment for women as it celebrates and caters to the rise in liberation of female in the society,[43] female sexuality,[44] refuses to shame Donna for her promiscuity,[45] and because it asserts that women should prioritise following their goals and enjoying their youths over marriage.[46] It also celebrates female friendship,[47] and undermines the importance of fathers in womens lives, prioritising self-actualisation and the role of the mother instead.[48] Librettist Catherine Johnson manages to express these themes through her transformation of ABBAs music, as she turns these somewhat stereotypical songs into empowering ones by having characters of different genders sing them.[49]","input":"When did mamma mia first come out on broadway?"},{"output":"1960s","context":"Student loans in the United States are a form of financial aid used to help more students access higher education. Student loan debt has been growing rapidly since 2006, rising to nearly $1.4 trillion by late 2016, roughly 7.5% GDP. Approximately 43 million have student loans, with an average balance of $30,000. Loans usually must be repaid, in contrast to other forms of financial aid such as scholarships, which never have to be repaid, and grants, which only rarely have to be repaid. Research indicates the increased usage of student loans has been a significant factor in college cost increases.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent loans play a very large role in U.S. higher education.[citation needed] Nearly 20 million Americans attend college each year. Of that 20 million, close to 12 million?ÿ  or 60%?ÿ  borrow annually to help cover costs. In Europe, higher education receives much more government funding, so student loans are much less common.[2] In parts of Asia and Latin America government funding for post-secondary education is lower?ÿ  usually limited to a few flagship universities, like the Mexican UNAM?ÿ  and there are no special programs under which students can easily and inexpensively borrow money.[2] However, in the United States, much of college is funded by students and their families through loans, although public institutions are funded in part through state and local taxes, and both private and public institutions through Pell grants and, especially with older schools, gifts from donors and alumni.[2][3] Some believe this substantially increases intergenerational correlations in income (having two generations of a family have similar earning ability), although other factors, including genetics, have been estimated to play a larger combined role.[4] Nonetheless, higher education in the United States has been shown to be an excellent investment both for individuals and for the public, even though differences in the returns to educational investment across schools has been overstated in many cases.[5][6][7]\\r\\nStudent loans come in several varieties in the United States, but are basically split into federal loans[8] and private student loans. The federal loans, for which the FAFSA is the application, are subdivided into subsidized (the government pays the interest while the student is studying at least half-time) and unsubsidized. Federal student loans are subsidized at the undergraduate level only. A subsidized loan is by far the best kind of loan, but an unsubsidized federal student loan is far better than a private student loan. Some states have their own loan programs, as do some colleges.[9] In almost all cases, these student loans have better conditions?ÿ  sometimes much better?ÿ  than the heavily advertised and expensive private student loans.[10]\\r\\nStudent loans may be used for any college-related expenses, including tuition, room and board, books, computers, and transportation expenses.\\r\\nAn unusual provision in the law prohibits student loans from being discharged through bankruptcy.\\r\\nThe main types of student loans in the United States are the following:\\r\\nUnited States Government-backed student loans were first offered in 1958 under the National Defense Education Act (NDEA), and were only available to select categories of students, such as those studying toward engineering, science, or education degrees. The student loan program, along with other parts of the Act, which subsidized college professor training, was established in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite, and a widespread perception that the United States was falling behind in science and technology, in the middle of the Cold War. Student loans were extended more broadly in the 1960s under the Higher Education Act of 1965, with the goal of encouraging greater social mobility and equality of opportunity.[3][18]\\r\\nPrior to 2010, Federal loans included both direct loansoriginated and funded directly by the United States Department of Educationand guaranteed loansoriginated and funded by private investors, but guaranteed by the federal government. Guaranteed loans were eliminated in 2010 through the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act and replaced with direct loans because of a belief that guaranteed loans benefited private student loan companies at taxpayers expense, but did not reduce costs for students.[3][18]\\r\\nThese loans are available to college and university students via funds disbursed directly to the school and are used to supplement personal and family resources, scholarships, grants, and work-study. They may be subsidized by the U.S. Government or may be unsubsidized depending on financial need. The U.S. Department of Education published a booklet comparing federal loans with private loans. In this same document, the government describes what you may use the loan for:\\r\\nYou may use the money you receive only to pay for education expenses at the school that awarded your loan. Education expenses include school charges such as tuition; room and board; fees; books; supplies; equipment; dependent childcare expenses; transportation; and rental or purchase of a personal computer.\\r\\nBoth subsidized and unsubsidized loans are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education either directly or through guaranty agencies. Nearly all students are eligible to receive federal loans (regardless of credit score or other financial issues). Federal student loans are not priced according to any individualized measure of risk, nor are loan limits determined based on risk. Rather, pricing and loan limits are politically determined by Congress. Undergraduates typically receive lower interest rates, but graduate students typically can borrow more. This lack of risk-based pricing has been criticized by scholars as contributing to inefficiency in higher education.[3]\\r\\nBoth types offer a grace period of six months, which means that no payments are due until six months after graduation or after the borrower becomes a less-than-half-time student without graduating. Both types have a fairly modest annual limit. The dependent undergraduate limit effective for loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2008 is as follows (combined subsidized and unsubsidized limits): $5,500 per year for freshman undergraduate students, $6,500 for sophomore undergraduates, and $7,500 per year for junior and senior undergraduate students, as well as students enrolled in teacher certification or preparatory coursework for graduate programs. For independent undergraduates, the limits (combined subsidized and unsubsidized) effective for loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2008 are higher: $9,500 per year for freshman undergraduate students, $10,500 for sophomore undergraduates, and $12,500 per year for junior and senior undergraduate students, as well as students enrolled in teacher certification or preparatory coursework for graduate programs. Subsidized federal student loans are only offered to students with a demonstrated financial need. Financial need may vary from school to school. For these loans, the federal government makes interest payments while the student is in college. For example, those who borrow $10,000 during college owe $10,000 upon graduation.\\r\\nUnsubsidized federal student loans are also guaranteed by the U.S. Government, but the government, while controlling (setting) the interest rate, does not pay interest for the student, rather the interest accrues during college. Nearly all students are eligible for these loans regardless of financial need (on need, see Expected Family Contribution). Those who borrow $10,000 during college owe $10,000 plus interest upon graduation. For example, those who borrowed $10,000 and had $2,000 accrue in interest owe $12,000. Interest begins accruing on the $12,000, i.e., there is interest on the interest. The accrued interest is \\"capitalized\\" into the loan amount, and the borrower begins making payments on the accumulated total. Students can pay the interest while still in college, but few do so.\\r\\nFederal student loans for graduate students have higher limits: $8,500 for subsidized Stafford and $12,500 (limits may differ for certain courses of study) for unsubsidized Stafford. Many students also take advantage of the Federal Perkins Loan. For graduate students the limit for Perkins is $6,000 per year.\\r\\nStudents who borrow money for education through Stafford loans cannot exceed certain aggregate limits for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. For undergraduate dependent students, the maximum aggregate limit of subsidized and unsubsidized loans combined is $57,500, with subsidized loans limited to a maximum of $23,000 of the total loans.[19] Students who have borrowed the maximum amount in subsidized loans may (based on grade levelundergraduate, graduate/professional, etc.) take out a loan of less than or equal to the amount they would have been eligible for in subsidized loans. Once both the subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate limits have been met for both subsidized and unsubsidized loans, the student is unable to borrow additional Stafford loans until they pay back a portion of the borrowed funds. A student who has paid back some of these amounts regains eligibility up to the aggregate limits as before.\\r\\nGraduate students have a lifetime aggregate loan limit of $138,500.\\r\\nUsually these are PLUS loans (formerly standing for \\"Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students\\"). Unlike loans made to students, parents can borrow much more, usually enough to cover the remainder of the costs student financial aid does not cover. Interest accrues during the time the student is in school. No payments are required until the student is no longer in school, although parents may start repayment ahead of time if they want, thus saving on interest.\\r\\nThe parents are responsible for repayment on these loans, not the student. Loans to parents are not a 'cosigner' loan with the student having equal accountability. The parents have signed the master promissory note to repay the loan and, if they do not repay the loan, their credit rating will suffer. Also, parents are advised to consider what their monthly payments will be after borrowing for four years at this rate (initial loan documents will give the repayment schedule as if only one year of loans was taken out). What sounds like a \\"manageable\\" debt load of (for example) $200 a month from freshman year loans can mushroom to a much more daunting $800 a month by the time four years have been funded through loans. Borrowing is not free, and the more borrowed, the more expensive it is.\\r\\nUnder new legislation, graduate students are eligible to receive PLUS loans in their own names. These Graduate PLUS loans have the same interest rates and terms of Parent PLUS loans.\\r\\nThe current interest rate on these loans, set by the United States Congress in 2006, is 8.5%.\\r\\nFederal Direct Student Loans, also known as Direct Loans or FDLP loans, are funded from public capital originating with the United States Treasury. FDLP loans are distributed through a channel that begins with the U.S. Treasury Department and from there passes through the United States Department of Education, then to the college or university and then to the student.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Department of Education, more than 6,000 colleges, universities, and technical schools participate in FFELP, which represents about 80% of all schools. FFELP lending represents 75% of all federal student loan volume.\\r\\nIn 2010, the Health Care Reform Act incorporated provisions on Education, which terminated the Federal Family Education Loan Appropriations after June 30, 2010. From that date on, all government-backed student loans have been issued through the Direct Loans program.\\r\\nThe maximum amount that any student can borrow is adjusted as federal policies change. Current loan limits are below the cost of most four year private institutions and most flagship public universities, and students therefore typically borrow higher cost private student loans to make up the difference. Scholars have advocated increasing federal debt limits to reduce the interest charges to student debtors.[18]\\r\\nThe maximum amount that any student can borrow is adjusted as federal policies change. A study published in the winter 1996 edition of the Journal of Student Financial Aid, How Much Student Loan Debt Is Too Much? suggested that the monthly student debt payment for the average undergraduate should not exceed 8% of total monthly income after graduation. Some financial aid advisers have referred to this as \\"the 8% rule.\\" Circumstances vary for individuals, so the 8% level is an indicator, not a rule set in stone. A research report about the 8% level is available at the Iowa College Student Aid Commission.[20]\\r\\nThe Economist reported in June 2014 that United States student loan debt exceeded $1.2 trillion, with over 7 million debtors in default. Public universities increased their fees by a total of 27% over the five years ending in 2012, or 20% adjusted for inflation. Public university students paid an average of almost $8,400 annually for in-state tuition, with out-of-state students paying more than $19,000. For two decades ending in 2013, college costs have risen 1.6% more than inflation each year. Government funding per student fell 27% between 2007 and 2012. Student enrollments rose from 15.2 million in 1999 to 20.4 million in 2011, but fell 2% in 2012.[21][22]\\r\\nWhen Federal student loans enter repayment, they are automatically enrolled in standard repayment.[23] Under it, a borrower has 10 years to repay the total amount of his or her loan. The loan servicer (whoever is sending the bill) determines the monthly bill by calculating a fixed monthly payment amount that will pay off the original loan amount plus all accrued interest after 120 equal payments (12 payments per year).\\r\\nPayments pay off the interest building up each month, plus part of the original loan amount. Depending on the amount of the loan, the loan term may be shorter than 10 years. There is a $50 minimum monthly payment.\\r\\nIf a student's loan debt is high but their income is modest or zero, they may qualify for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. Most major types of federal student loansexcept for PLUS loans for parentsare eligible for an IDR plan.[24] Income-driven plans allow borrowers to cap their monthly payments to 10%, 15%, or 20% of disposable income for up to 20 or 25 years, after which the remaining balance is forgiven.[25]\\r\\nCurrently, four specific IDRs are available:\\r\\n1. Income-Based Repayment (IBR)\\r\\n2. Pay As You Earn (PAYE)\\r\\n3. Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE)\\r\\n4. Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR)\\r\\nUnited States Federal student loans and some private student loans can be discharged in bankruptcy only with a showing of \\"undue hardship.\\" In contrast to credit card debt, which often can be discharged through bankruptcy proceedings,[26][27][28][29] this option is not generally available for educational loan debt.[30][31][32] Additionally, those seeking to discharge their student loan debt must initiate an adversary proceeding, a separate lawsuit within the bankruptcy case where they illustrate the required undue hardship.[33] Many borrowers cannot afford to retain an attorney or the additional litigation costs associated with an adversary proceeding, let alone a bankruptcy case. Further complicating matters, the undue hardship standard varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but is generally difficult to meet, making student loans practically non-dischargeable through bankruptcy. In most circuits discharge depends on meeting three prongs in the Brunner test:[34]\\r\\nAs noted by the district court, there is very little appellate authority on the definition of \\"undue hardship\\" in the context of 11 U.S.C.  523(a)(8)(B). Based on legislative history and the decisions of other district and bankruptcy courts, the district court adopted a standard for \\"undue hardship\\" requiring a three-part showing: (1) that the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a \\"minimal\\" standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans; (2) that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans; and (3) that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans. For the reasons set forth in the district court's order, we adopt this analysis. The first part of this test has been applied frequently as the minimum necessary to establish \\"undue hardship.\\" See, e.g., Bryant v. Pennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency (In re Bryant), 72 B.R. 913, 915 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1987); North Dakota State Bd. of Higher Educ. v. Frech (In re Frech), 62 B.R. 235 (Bankr.D.Minn.1986); Marion v. Pennsylvania Higher Educ. Assistance Agency (In re Marion), 61 B.R. 815 (Bankr.W.D.Pa.1986). Requiring such a showing comports with common sense as well.[35]\\r\\nWhile federal student loans can be discharged administratively for total and permanent disability, private student loans cannot be discharged outside of bankruptcy.[30][31][32]\\r\\nOne set of empirical data comes from Education Credit Management Corporation, which serviced loans for twenty-five lending agencies and the United States Department of Education; in 2008 it was reported that of 72,000 loans in bankruptcy proceedings, only 276 debtors attempted discharge, and by November 2009 of the 134 resolutions thus far, 29 resulted in total or partial discharge.[36]\\r\\nA review of records in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Washington found that 57% of the 115 adversary proceedings reviewed in a 5-year period resulted in partial discharge, through settlement or trial; however, the authors cautioned not to generalize the results of this small sample.[37] 86% involved either (or both) the United States Department of Education or the Education Credit Management Corporation, a nonprofit which services loans where the student has declared bankruptcy.[37]\\r\\nThe rules for total and permanent disability discharge underwent major changes as a result of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. Loan holders are no longer required to be unable to earn any income, but instead the standard is \\"substantial gainful activity\\" (SGA) as a result of disability. The new regulations took effect July 1, 2010.[38] Under further changes set to take effect July 1, 2013, if a borrower is determined to be disabled by the Social Security Administration, that determination will be accepted as proof of total and permanent disability if the SSA placed the individual on a five- to seven-year review cycle (the longest currently used by SSA).[39]\\r\\nThese are loans that are not guaranteed by a government agency and are made to students by banks or finance companies. Private loans cost more and have much less favorable terms than federal loans, and are generally only used when students have exhausted the borrowing limit under federal student loans. They are not eligible for Income Based Repayment plans, and frequently have less flexible payment terms, higher fees, and more penalties.[3][18][40]\\r\\nAdvocates of private student loans suggest that they combine the best elements of the different government loans into one: they generally offer higher loan limits than federal student loans, ensuring the student is not left with a budget gap. Unlike federal parent (PLUS) loans, they generally offer a grace period of six months (occasionally 12 months) with no payments due until after graduation; however, interest accrues and is added to the principal. Most experts unconnected to the private loan industry recommend private student loans only as an expensive last resort, because of the higher interest rates, multiple fees, and lack of the borrower protections which are built into the federal loans.[41][42]\\r\\nPrivate student loans generally come in two types: school-channel and direct-to-consumer.\\r\\nSchool-channel loans offer borrowers lower interest rates but generally take longer to process. School-channel loans are \\"certified\\" by the school, which means the school signs off on the borrowing amount, and the funds are disbursed directly to the school. The \\"certification\\" means only that the school confirms the loan funds will be used for educational expenses only, and agrees to hold them and disburse them as needed. Certification does not mean that the school approves of, recommends, or has even examined the terms (conditions) of the loan.\\r\\nDirect-to-consumer private loans are not certified by the school; schools don't interact with a direct-to-consumer private loan at all. The student simply supplies enrollment verification to the lender, and the loan proceeds are disbursed directly to the student. While direct-to-consumer loans generally carry higher interest rates than school-channel loans, they do allow families to get access to funds very quickly  in some cases, in a matter of days. Some argue that this convenience is offset by the risk of student over-borrowing and/or use of funds for inappropriate purposes, since there is no third-party certification that the amount of the loan is appropriate for the education needs of the student in question, or that it will be used only for education.[43]\\r\\nDirect-to-consumer private loans was the fastest growing segment of education finance with the \\"percentage of undergraduates obtaining private loans from 2003ÿ04 to 2007ÿ08 rose from 5 percent to 14 percent\\" and were under legislative scrutiny due to the lack of school certification.[44][45] Loan providers range from large education finance companies to specialty companies that focus exclusively on this niche.[43][45] Lenders often push such loans by advertising: \\"no FAFSA required,\\" or \\"Funds disbursed directly to you.\\" But since the passing of Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010(HCERA), the death knell sounded for private sector lending under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). Since July 1, 2010, no new student loans have been made under the FFELP; all subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, PLUS loans, and Consolidation loans have been made solely under the Federal Direct Loan Program.[45]\\r\\nFederal student loan interest rates are set by Congress, and fixed. Private student loans usually have substantially higher interest rates, and the rates fluctuate depending on the financial markets. Some private loans disguise the true cost of borrowing by requiring substantial up-front origination \\"fees\\", which enable deceptively lower interest rates to be offered. Interest rates also vary depending on the applicant's credit history.\\r\\nMost private loan programs are tied to one or more financial indexes, such as the Wall Street Journal Prime rate or the BBA LIBOR rate, plus an overhead charge. Because private loans are based on the credit history of the applicant, the overhead charge varies. Students and families with excellent credit generally receive lower rates and smaller loan origination fees than those with poorer credit histories. Money paid toward interest is now tax deductible. However, lenders rarely give complete details of the terms of the private student loan until after the student submits an application, in part because this helps prevent comparisons based on cost. For example, many lenders only advertise the lowest interest rate they charge (for good credit borrowers). Borrowers with bad credit can expect interest rates that are as much as 6% higher, loan fees that are as much as 9% higher, and loan limits that are two-thirds lower than the advertised figures.[46]\\r\\nPrivate loans often carry an origination fee, which can be substantial. Origination fees are a one-time charge based on the amount of the loan. They can be taken out of the total loan amount or added on top of the total loan amount, often at the borrower's preference. Some lenders offer low-interest, 0-fee loans.[citation needed] Each percentage point on the front-end fee gets paid once, while each percentage point on the interest rate is calculated and paid throughout the life of the loan. Some have suggested that this makes the interest rate more critical than the origination fee.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn fact, there is an easy solution to the fee-vs.-rate question: All lenders are legally required to provide you a statement of the \\"APR (Annual Percentage Rate)\\" for the loan before you sign a promissory note and commit to it. Unlike the \\"base\\" rate, this rate includes any fees charged and can be thought of as the \\"effective\\" interest rate including actual interest, fees, etc. When comparing loans, it may be easier to compare APR rather than \\"rate\\" to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison. APR is the best yardstick to compare loans that have the same repayment term; however, if the repayment terms are different, APR becomes a less-perfect comparison tool. With different term loans, consumers often look to \\"total financing costs\\" to understand their financing options.\\r\\nEligible loan programs generally issue loans based on the credit history of the applicant and any applicable cosigner/co-endorser/coborrower. This is in contrast to federal loan programs that deal primarily with need-based criteria, as defined by the EFC and the FAFSA. For many students, this is a great advantage to private loan programs, as their families may have too much income or too many assets to qualify for federal aid but insufficient assets and income to pay for school without assistance. The benefit of a co-signer is that a lender considers the income and credit history of both the student and the co-signer, which improves the student's chances of being approved for a student loan.[47]\\r\\nMany international students in the United States can obtain private loans (they are usually ineligible for federal loans) with a cosigner who is a United States citizen or permanent resident. However, some graduate programs (notably top MBA programs) have a tie-up with private loan providers and in those cases no cosigner is needed even for international students.[48]\\r\\nAfter a student and the student's co-signer are approved for a student loan, a private student loan lender may offer a co-signer release option, which \\"releases\\" the original co-signer from any financial responsibility for the student loan. There are several student loan lenders who offer co-signer releases and other benefits.[49]\\r\\nIn contrast with federal loans, whose terms are public and standardized, the terms for private loans vary from lender to lender. However, it is not easy to compare them, as some conditions may not be revealed until the student is presented with a contract (promissory note) to sign. A common suggestion is to shop around on all terms, not just respond to \\"rates as low as...\\" tactics that are sometimes little more than bait-and-switch. However, shopping around could damage your credit score.[50] Examples of other borrower terms and benefits that vary by lender are deferments (amount of time after leaving school before payments start) and forbearances (a period when payments are temporarily stopped due to financial or other hardship). These policies are solely based on the contract between lender and borrower and not set by Department of Education policies.\\r\\nIn 1987, then-Secretary of Education William Bennett argued that ... increases in financial aid in recent years have enabled colleges and universities blithely to raise their tuitions, confident that Federal loan subsidies would help cushion the increase.[51] This statement came to be known as the Bennett Hypothesis. In July 2015 (revised in March 2016), a Staff Report was published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the conclusions of which indicate that institutions more exposed to increases in student loan program maximums tend to respond with disproportionate raises in tuition prices:\\r\\nIn this paper, we use a Bartik-like approach to identify the effect of increased loan supply on tuition following large policy changes in federal aid program maximums available to undergraduate students that occurred between 2008 and 2010. We construct institution-specific changes in program maximums as the interaction of an institution exposure to the maximums in each aid program (the fraction of qualifying students) and the legislated program maximums. We find that institutions that were most exposed to these maximums ahead of the policy changes experienced disproportionate tuition increases around these changes, with effects of changes in institution-specific program maximums of Pell Grant, subsidized loan, and unsubsidized loan of about 40, 60, and 15 cents on the dollar, respectively.[1]\\r\\nThe federal student loan program has been criticized for not adjusting interest rates according to the riskiness of factors that are under students' control, such as choice of academic major. Critics have contended that this lack of risk-based pricing contributes to inefficiency and misallocation of resources in higher education, and lower productivity in the labor market.[3] However, recent research indicates that while high levels of student loan debt, coupled with high default rates, present a number of challenges for individual student loan borrowers and for the federal government (which must cover the defaults through taxes), they do not necessarily place a substantial burden on society at large.[52]\\r\\nAfter the passage of the bankruptcy reform bill of 2005, both federal and private student loans are not discharged during bankruptcy (prior to the passage of this bill, only federal student loans were unable to be discharged). This provided a credit risk free loan for the lender, averaging 7 percent a year.[53] In January 2013, the \\"Fairness for Struggling Students Act\\" was unveiled. This bill, if passed, would once again allow private student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy.[54] The bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee where it died.[55]\\r\\nSome critics of financial aid claim that, because schools are assured of receiving their fees no matter what happens to their students, they have felt free to raise their fees to very high levels, to accept students of inadequate academic ability, and to produce too many graduates in some fields of study. About one-third of students, whether or not they graduate or find jobs that match their credentials, are financially burdened for much of their lives by their debt obligations, instead of being economically productive citizens. When those former students default on their obligations, the burdens are shifted to taxpayers. Lastly, the proportion of graduates who come from poor backgrounds has actually declined since 1970.[56]\\r\\nIn 2007, the Attorney General of New York State, Andrew Cuomo, led an investigation into lending practices and anti-competitive relationships between student lenders and universities. Specifically, many universities steered student borrowers to \\"preferred lenders\\" that charged higher interest rates. Some of these \\"preferred lenders\\" allegedly rewarded university financial aid staff with kick backs. This led to changes in lending policy at many major American universities. Many universities have also rebated millions of dollars in fees back to affected borrowers.[57][58]\\r\\nThe biggest lenders, Sallie Mae and Nelnet, are criticized by borrowers. They frequently find themselves embroiled in lawsuits, the most serious of which was filed in 2007. The False Claims Suit was filed on behalf of the federal government by former Department of Education researcher, Dr. Jon Oberg, against Sallie Mae, Nelnet, and other lenders. Oberg argued that the lenders overcharged the United States Government and defrauded taxpayers of over $22 million. In August 2010, Nelnet settled the lawsuit and paid $55 million.[59]\\r\\nIn an effort to improve the student loan market, startups like LendKey, SoFi (Social Finance, Inc.), Konsolidate and CommonBond were founded to offer student loans and refinance loans at lower rates than traditional repayment systems using an alumni-funded model.[60][61] According to a 2016 analysis by online student loan marketplace Credible, about 8 million borrowers could qualify to refinance their loans at a lower interest rate.[62]\\r\\nThe New York Times published an editorial in 2011 in support of allowing private loans to again be discharged during bankruptcy.[63]\\r\\nIn June 2010, the amount of student loan debt held by Americans exceeded the amount of credit card debt held by Americans.[64] At that time, student loan debt totaled at least $830 billion, of which approximately 80% was federal student loan debt and 20% was private student loan debt. By the fourth quarter of 2015, total outstanding student loans owned and securitized had risen to, and surpassed, $1.3 trillion.[65] This rising student debt is contributing to the expanding wealth gap.[66]\\r\\nWith each passing year, student debt continues to rise. Nearly two-thirds of undergraduates are in debt. By graduation, their student loan debt averages around $26,600. One percent of graduates leave college with $100,000 or more of student loan debt. In 2013, the federal debt had grown to $16.7 trillion. Six percent of that debt comes directly from student loans making student loans only second to mortgages in consumer debt. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported that as of May 2013, federal student loan debt had reached $1 trillion bringing the total number for outstanding student loan debt to $1.2 trillion. However, this amount does not include what students take from savings accounts, borrow from parents, or charge to their credit cards in order to pay for their education. In actuality, the burden of student debt is much greater than these numbers indicate.[67] The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's February 2017 Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit reported that 11.2% of aggregate student loan debt was 90 or more days delinquent in the final quarter of 2016.[68]","input":"When did the federal student loan program start?"},{"output":"Kazuya Nakai","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nKazuya Nakai ( I, Nakai Kazuya, born November 25, 1967) is a Japanese voice actor who was born in Kobe, Japan.

In its pure form, it is a colourless liquid, slightly more viscous than water. Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide (a compound with an oxygenÿoxygen single bond). It is used as an oxidizer, bleaching agent and disinfectant. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide, or \\"high-test peroxide\\", is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry.[4] Its chemistry is dominated by the nature of its unstable peroxide bond.\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide is unstable and slowly decomposes in the presence of base or a catalyst. Because of its instability, hydrogen peroxide is typically stored with a stabilizer in a weakly acidic solution. Hydrogen peroxide is found in biological systems including the human body. Enzymes that use or decompose hydrogen peroxide are classified as peroxidases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boiling point of H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 has been extrapolated as being 150.2?C, approximately 50?C higher than water. In practice hydrogen peroxide will undergo potentially explosive thermal decomposition if heated to this temperature. It may be safely distilled at lower temperatures under reduced pressure.[5]\\r\\nIn aqueous solutions hydrogen peroxide differs from the pure material due to the effects of hydrogen bonding between water and hydrogen peroxide molecules. Hydrogen peroxide and water form a eutectic mixture, exhibiting freezing-point depression; pure water has a melting point of 0?C and pure hydrogen peroxide of ?0.43?C. The boiling point of the same mixtures is also depressed in relation with the mean of both boiling points (125.1?C). It occurs at 114?C. This boiling point is 14?C greater than that of pure water and 36.2?C less than that of pure hydrogen peroxide.[6]\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide (H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2) is a nonplanar molecule with (twisted) C2 symmetry. Although the O?O bond is a single bond, the molecule has a relatively high rotational barrier of 2460 cm?1 (29.45 kJ/mol);[7] for comparison, the rotational barrier for ethane is 12.5 kJ/mol. The increased barrier is ascribed to repulsion between the lone pairs of the adjacent oxygen atoms and results in hydrogen peroxide displaying atropisomerism.\\r\\nThe molecular structures of gaseous and crystalline H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 are significantly different. This difference is attributed to the effects of hydrogen bonding, which is absent in the gaseous state.[8] Crystals of H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 are tetragonal with the space group D4\\r\\n4P4121.[9]\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide has several structural analogues with Hm?X?X?Hn bonding arrangements (water also shown for comparison). It has the highest (theoretical) boiling point of this series (X = O, N, S). Its melting point is also fairly high, being comparable to that of hydrazine and water, with only hydroxylamine crystallising significantly more readily, indicative of particularly strong hydrogen bonding. Diphosphane and hydrogen disulfide exhibit only weak hydrogen bonding and have little chemical similarity to hydrogen peroxide. All of these analogues are thermodynamically unstable. Structurally, the analogues all adopt similar skewed structures, due to repulsion between adjacent lone pairs.\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide was first described in 1818 by Louis Jacques Thnard, who produced it by treating barium peroxide with nitric acid.[10] An improved version of this process used hydrochloric acid, followed by addition of sulfuric acid to precipitate the barium sulfate byproduct. Thnard's process was used from the end of the 19th century until the middle of the 20th century.[11]\\r\\nPure hydrogen peroxide was long believed to be unstable, as early attempts to separate it from the water, which is present during synthesis, all failed. This instability was due to traces of impurities (transition-metal salts), which catalyze the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide. Pure hydrogen peroxide was first obtained in 1894almost 80 years after its discoveryby Richard Wolffenstein, who produced it by vacuum distillation.[12]\\r\\nDetermination of the molecular structure of hydrogen peroxide proved to be very difficult. In 1892 the Italian physical chemist Giacomo Carrara (1864ÿ1925) determined its molecular mass by freezing-point depression, which confirmed that its molecular formula is H2O2.[13] At least half a dozen hypothetical molecular structures seemed to be consistent with the available evidence.[14] In 1934, the English mathematical physicist William Penney and the Scottish physicist Gordon Sutherland proposed a molecular structure for hydrogen peroxide that was very similar to the presently accepted one.[15]\\r\\nPreviously, hydrogen peroxide was prepared industrially by hydrolysis of the ammonium peroxydisulfate, which was itself obtained by the electrolysis of a solution of ammonium bisulfate (NH\\r\\n4HSO\\r\\n4) in sulfuric acid:\\r\\nToday, hydrogen peroxide is manufactured almost exclusively by the anthraquinone process, which was formalized in 1936 and patented in 1939. It begins with the reduction of an anthraquinone (such as 2-ethylanthraquinone or the 2-amyl derivative) to the corresponding anthrahydroquinone, typically by hydrogenation on a palladium catalyst; the anthrahydroquinone then undergoes autoxidation to regenerate the starting anthraquinone, with hydrogen peroxide as a by-product. Most commercial processes achieve oxidation by bubbling compressed air through a solution of the derivatized anthracene, whereby the oxygen present in the air reacts with the labile hydrogen atoms (of the hydroxy groups), giving hydrogen peroxide and regenerating the anthraquinone. Hydrogen peroxide is then extracted, and the anthraquinone derivative is reduced back to the dihydroxy (anthracene) compound using hydrogen gas in the presence of a metal catalyst. The cycle then repeats itself.[16][17]\\r\\nThe simplified overall equation for the process is simple:[16]\\r\\nThe economics of the process depend heavily on effective recycling of the quinone (which is expensive) and extraction solvents, and of the hydrogenation catalyst.\\r\\nA process to produce hydrogen peroxide directly from the elements has been of interest for many years. Direct synthesis is difficult to achieve, as the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen thermodynamically favours production of water. Systems for direct synthesis have been developed, most of which are based around finely dispersed metal catalysts.[18][19] None of these has yet reached a point where they can be used for industrial-scale synthesis.\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide is most commonly available as a solution in water. For consumers, it is usually available from pharmacies at 3 and 6 wt% concentrations. The concentrations are sometimes described in terms of the volume of oxygen gas generated; one milliliter of a 20-volume solution generates twenty milliliters of oxygen gas when completely decomposed. For laboratory use, 30 wt% solutions are most common. Commercial grades from 70% to 98% are also available, but due to the potential of solutions of more than 68% hydrogen peroxide to be converted entirely to steam and oxygen (with the temperature of the steam increasing as the concentration increases above 68%) these grades are potentially far more hazardous and require special care in dedicated storage areas. Buyers must typically allow inspection by commercial manufacturers.\\r\\nIn 1994, world production of H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 was around 1.9 million tonnes and grew to 2.2 million in 2006,[20] most of which was at a concentration of 70% or less. In that year bulk 30% H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 sold for around 0.54 USD/kg, equivalent to 1.50 USD/kg (0.68 USD/lb) on a \\"100% basis\\".[21]\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes to form water and oxygen with a Ho of ?98.2?kJ/mol and a S of 70.5?J/(mol{K):\\r\\nThe rate of decomposition increases with rising temperature, concentration and pH, with cool, dilute, acidic solutions showing the best stability. Decomposition is catalysed by various compounds, including most transition metals and their compounds (e.g. manganese dioxide, silver, and platinum).[22] Certain metal ions, such as Fe2+ or Ti3+, can cause the decomposition to take a different path, with free radicals such as (HO{) and (HOO{) being formed. Non-metallic catalysts include potassium iodide, which reacts particularly rapidly and forms the basis of the elephant toothpaste experiment. Hydrogen peroxide can also be decomposed biologically by the enzyme catalase. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide liberates oxygen and heat; this can be dangerous, as spilling high-concentration hydrogen peroxide on a flammable substance can cause an immediate fire.\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide exhibits oxidizing and reducing properties, depending on pH.\\r\\nIn acidic solutions, H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 is one of the most powerful oxidizers knownstronger than chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and potassium permanganate. Also, through catalysis, H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 can be converted into hydroxyl radicals ({OH), which are highly reactive.\\r\\nIn acidic solutions Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+ (hydrogen peroxide acting as an oxidizing agent):\\r\\nand sulfite (SO2?\\r\\n3) is oxidized to sulfate (SO2?\\r\\n4). However, potassium permanganate is reduced to Mn2+ by acidic H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2. Under alkaline conditions, however, some of these reactions reverse; for example, Mn2+ is oxidized to Mn4+ (as MnO\\r\\n2).\\r\\nIn basic solution, hydrogen peroxide can reduce a variety of inorganic ions. When it acts as a reducing agent, oxygen gas is also produced. For example, hydrogen peroxide will reduce sodium hypochlorite and potassium permanganate, which is a convenient method for preparing oxygen in the laboratory:\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide is frequently used as an oxidizing agent. Illustrative is oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides:[23][24]\\r\\nAlkaline hydrogen peroxide is used for epoxidation of electron-deficient alkenes such as acrylic acid derivatives, and for the oxidation of alkylboranes to alcohols, the second step of hydroboration-oxidation. It is also the principal reagent in the Dakin oxidation process.\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide is a weak acid, forming hydroperoxide or peroxide salts with many metals.\\r\\nIt also converts metal oxides into the corresponding peroxides. For example, upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide, chromic acid (CrO\\r\\n3)[clarify] forms an unstable blue peroxide CrO(O\\r\\n2)\\r\\n2.\\r\\nThis kind of reaction is used industrially to produce peroxoanions. For example, reaction with borax leads to sodium perborate, a bleach used in laundry detergents:\\r\\nH\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 converts carboxylic acids (RCO2H) into peroxy acids (RC(O)O2H), which are themselves used as oxidizing agents. Hydrogen peroxide reacts with acetone to form acetone peroxide and with ozone to form trioxidane. Hydrogen peroxide forms stable adducts with urea (hydrogen peroxide - urea), sodium carbonate (sodium percarbonate) and other compounds.[25] An acid-base adduct with triphenylphosphine oxide is a useful \\"carrier\\" for H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 in some reactions.\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide is also one of the two chief chemicals in the defence system of the bombardier beetle, reacting with hydroquinone to discourage predators.\\r\\nA study published in Nature found that hydrogen peroxide plays a role in the immune system. Scientists found that hydrogen peroxide presence inside cells increased after tissues are damaged in zebrafish, which is thought to act as a signal to white blood cells to converge on the site and initiate the healing process. When the genes required to produce hydrogen peroxide were disabled, white blood cells did not accumulate at the site of damage. The experiments were conducted on fish; however, because fish are genetically similar to humans, the same process is speculated to occur in humans. The study in Nature suggested asthma sufferers have higher levels of hydrogen peroxide in their lungs than healthy people, which could explain why asthma sufferers have inappropriate levels of white blood cells in their lungs.[26][27]\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide has important roles as a signalling molecule in the regulation of a wide variety of biological processes.[28] The compound is a major factor implicated in the free-radical theory of aging, based on how readily hydrogen peroxide can decompose into a hydroxyl radical and how superoxide radical byproducts of cellular metabolism can react with ambient water to form hydrogen peroxide.[29] These hydroxyl radicals in turn readily react with and damage vital cellular components, especially those of the mitochondria.[30][31][32] At least one study has also tried to link hydrogen peroxide production to cancer.[33] These studies have frequently been quoted in fraudulent treatment claims.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe amount of hydrogen peroxide in biological systems can be assayed using a fluorimetric assay.[34]\\r\\nAbout 60% of the world's production of hydrogen peroxide is used for pulp- and paper-bleaching.[20] The second major industrial application is the manufacture of sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate which are used as mild bleaches in laundry detergents.\\r\\nIt is used in the production of various organic peroxides with dibenzoyl peroxide being a high volume example. This is used in polymerisations, as a flour bleaching agent and as a treatment for acne. Peroxy acids, such as peracetic acid and meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid are also typically produced using hydrogen peroxide.\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide is used in certain waste-water treatment processes to remove organic impurities. This is achieved by advanced oxidation processes, such as the Fenton reaction,[35][36] which use it to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ({OH). These are able to destroy organic contaminates which are ordinarily difficult to remove, such as aromatic or halogenated compounds.[37] It can also oxidize sulfur based compounds present in the waste; which is beneficial as it generally reduces their odour.[38]\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide can be used for the sterilization of various surfaces,[39] including surgical tools[40] and may be deployed as a vapour (VHP) for room sterilization.[41] H2O2 demonstrates broad-spectrum efficacy against viruses, bacteria, yeasts, and bacterial spores.[42] In general, greater activity is seen against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria; however, the presence of catalase or other peroxidases in these organisms can increase tolerance in the presence of lower concentrations.[43] Higher concentrations of H2O2 (10 to 30%) and longer contact times are required for sporicidal activity.[44]\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide is seen as an environmentally safe alternative to chlorine-based bleaches, as it degrades to form oxygen and water and it is generally recognized as safe as an antimicrobial agent by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[45]\\r\\nHistorically hydrogen peroxide was used for disinfecting wounds, partly because of its low cost and prompt availability compared to other antiseptics. It is now thought to slow healing and lead to scarring because it destroys newly formed skin cells.[46] Only a very low concentration of H2O2 can induce healing, and only if not repeatedly applied.[47] Surgical use can lead to gas embolism formation.[48][49] Despite this it is still used for wound treatment in many developing countries.[50][51]\\r\\nDermal exposure to dilute solutions of hydrogen peroxide cause whitening or bleaching of the skin due to microembolism caused by oxygen bubbles in the capillaries.[52]\\r\\nDiluted H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 (between 1.9% and 12%) mixed with ammonium hydroxide is used to bleach human hair. The chemical's bleaching property lends its name to the phrase \\"peroxide blonde\\".[53] Hydrogen peroxide is also used for tooth whitening. It can be found in most whitening toothpastes. Hydrogen peroxide has shown positive results involving teeth lightness and chroma shade parameters. It works by oxidizing colored pigments onto the enamel where the shade of the tooth can indeed become lighter. Hydrogen peroxide can be mixed with baking soda and salt to make a home-made toothpaste.[54]\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide may be used to treat acne,[55] although benzoyl peroxide is a more common treatment.\\r\\nPractitioners of alternative medicine have advocated the use of hydrogen peroxide for the treatment of various conditions, including emphysema, influenza, AIDS and in particular cancer,[56] although the effectiveness is scientifically questionable and in some cases it may even be fatal.[57][58][59][60][61]\\r\\nThe practice calls for the daily consumption of hydrogen peroxide, either orally or by injection and is, in general, based around two precepts. First, that hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced by the body to combat infection; and second, that human pathogens (including cancer: See Warburg hypothesis) are anaerobic and cannot survive in oxygen-rich environments. The ingestion or injection of hydrogen peroxide is therefore believed to kill disease by mimicking the immune response in addition to increasing levels of oxygen within the body. This makes it similar to other oxygen-based therapies, such as ozone therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.\\r\\nBoth the effectiveness and safety of hydrogen peroxide therapy is scientifically questionable. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by the immune system but in a carefully controlled manner. Cells called by phagocytes engulf pathogens and then use hydrogen peroxide to destroy them. The peroxide is toxic to both the cell and the pathogen and so is kept within a special compartment, called a phagosome. Free hydrogen peroxide will damage any tissue it encounters via oxidative stress; a process which also has been proposed as a cause of cancer.[62] Claims that hydrogen peroxide therapy increase cellular levels of oxygen have not been supported. The quantities administered would be expected to provide very little additional oxygen compared to that available from normal respiration. It should also be noted that it is difficult to raise the level of oxygen around cancer cells within a tumour, as the blood supply tends to be poor, a situation known as tumor hypoxia.\\r\\nLarge oral doses of hydrogen peroxide at a 3% concentration may cause irritation and blistering to the mouth, throat, and abdomen as well as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[57] Intravenous injection of hydrogen peroxide has been linked to several deaths.[59][60][61]\\r\\nThe American Cancer Society states that \\"there is no scientific evidence that hydrogen peroxide is a safe, effective or useful cancer treatment.\\"[58] Furthermore, the therapy is not approved by the U.S. FDA.\\r\\nHigh-concentration H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 is referred to as \\"high-test peroxide\\" (HTP). It can be used either as a monopropellant (not mixed with fuel) or as the oxidizer component of a bipropellant rocket. Use as a monopropellant takes advantage of the decomposition of 70ÿ98% concentration hydrogen peroxide into steam and oxygen. The propellant is pumped into a reaction chamber, where a catalyst, usually a silver or platinum screen, triggers decomposition, producing steam at over 600?C (1,112?F), which is expelled through a nozzle, generating thrust. H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 monopropellant produces a maximal specific impulse (Isp) of 161 s (1.6 kN{s/kg). Peroxide was the first major monopropellant adopted for use in rocket applications. Hydrazine eventually replaced hydrogen-peroxide monopropellant thruster applications primarily because of a 25% increase in the vacuum specific impulse.[63] Hydrazine (toxic) and hydrogen peroxide (less-toxic [ACGIH TLV 0.01 and 1 ppm respectively]) are the only two monopropellants (other than cold gases) to have been widely adopted and utilized for propulsion and power applications. The Bell Rocket Belt, reaction-control systems for X-1, X-15, Centaur, Mercury, Little Joe, as well as the turbo-pump gas generators for X-1, X-15, Jupiter, Redstone and Viking used hydrogen peroxide as a monopropellant.[64]\\r\\nAs a bipropellant, H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 is decomposed to burn a fuel as an oxidizer. Specific impulses as high as 350 s (3.5?kN{s/kg) can be achieved, depending on the fuel. Peroxide used as an oxidizer gives a somewhat lower Isp than liquid oxygen, but is dense, storable, noncryogenic and can be more easily used to drive gas turbines to give high pressures using an efficient closed cycle. It can also be used for regenerative cooling of rocket engines. Peroxide was used very successfully as an oxidizer in World War II German rocket motors (e.g. T-Stoff, containing oxyquinoline stabilizer, for both the Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe RATO externally podded monopropellant booster system, and for the Walter HWK 109-509 rocket motor series used for the Me 163B), most often used with C-Stoff in a self-igniting hypergolic combination, and for the low-cost British Black Knight and Black Arrow launchers.\\r\\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, the Hellmuth Walter KG-conceived turbine used hydrogen peroxide for use in submarines while submerged; it was found to be too noisy and require too much maintenance compared to diesel-electric power systems. Some torpedoes used hydrogen peroxide as oxidizer or propellant. Operator error in the use of hydrogen-peroxide torpedoes was named as possible causes for the sinkings of HMS Sidon and the Russian submarine Kursk.[65] SAAB Underwater Systems is manufacturing the Torpedo 2000. This torpedo, used by the Swedish Navy, is powered by a piston engine propelled by HTP as an oxidizer and kerosene as a fuel in a bipropellant system.[66][67]\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide has been used for creating organic peroxide-based explosives, such as acetone peroxide, for improvised explosive devices. Hydrogen peroxide itself also acts as an explosive in high concentrations when placed in an absorbent, and has been used in attacks including the 7 July 2005 London bombings.[68] These explosives tend to degrade quickly and hence are not used as commercial or military explosives.\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide has various domestic uses, primarily as a cleaning and disinfecting agent.\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide reacts with certain di-esters, such as phenyl oxalate ester (cyalume), to produce chemiluminescence; this application is most commonly encountered in the form of glow sticks.\\r\\nSome horticulturalists and users of hydroponics advocate the use of weak hydrogen peroxide solution in watering solutions. Its spontaneous decomposition releases oxygen that enhances a plant's root development and helps to treat root rot (cellular root death due to lack of oxygen) and a variety of other pests.[69][70]\\r\\nLaboratory tests conducted by fish culturists in recent years have demonstrated that common household hydrogen peroxide can be used safely to provide oxygen for small fish. The hydrogen peroxide releases oxygen by decomposition when it is exposed to catalysts such as manganese dioxide.\\r\\nRegulations vary, but low concentrations, such as 6%, are widely available and legal to buy for medical use. Most over-the-counter peroxide solutions are not suitable for ingestion. Higher concentrations may be considered hazardous and are typically accompanied by a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). In high concentrations, hydrogen peroxide is an aggressive oxidizer and will corrode many materials, including human skin. In the presence of a reducing agent, high concentrations of H\\r\\n2O\\r\\n2 will react violently.\\r\\nHigh-concentration hydrogen peroxide streams, typically above 40%, should be considered hazardous due to concentrated hydrogen peroxide's meeting the definition of a DOT oxidizer according to U.S. regulations, if released into the environment. The EPA Reportable Quantity (RQ) for D001 hazardous wastes is 100 pounds (45?kg), or approximately 10 US gallons (38?L), of concentrated hydrogen peroxide.\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide should be stored in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area and away from any flammable or combustible substances. It should be stored in a container composed of non-reactive materials such as stainless steel or glass (other materials including some plastics and aluminium alloys may also be suitable).[71] Because it breaks down quickly when exposed to light, it should be stored in an opaque container, and pharmaceutical formulations typically come in brown bottles that block light.[72]\\r\\nHydrogen peroxide, either in pure or diluted form, can pose several risks, the main one being that it forms explosive mixtures upon contact with organic compounds.[73] Highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide itself is unstable and can cause a boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE) of the remaining liquid. Distillation of hydrogen peroxide at normal pressures is thus highly dangerous. It is also corrosive, especially when concentrated, but even domestic-strength solutions can cause irritation to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin.[74] Swallowing hydrogen peroxide solutions is particularly dangerous, as decomposition in the stomach releases large quantities of gas (10 times the volume of a 3% solution), leading to internal bloating. Inhaling over 10% can cause severe pulmonary irritation.[75]\\r\\nWith a significant vapour pressure (1.2 kPa at 50?C[76]), hydrogen-peroxide vapour is potentially hazardous. According to U.S. NIOSH, the immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) limit is only 75 ppm.[77] The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established a permissible exposure limit of 1.0 ppm calculated as an 8-hour time-weighted average (29 CFR 1910.1000, Table Z-1).[73] Hydrogen peroxide has also been classified by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) as a \\"known animal carcinogen, with unknown relevance on humans\\".[78] For workplaces where there is a risk of exposure to the hazardous concentrations of the vapours, continuous monitors for hydrogen peroxide should be used. Information on the hazards of hydrogen peroxide is available from OSHA[73] and from the ATSDR.[79]\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nBibliography","input":"Why hydrogen peroxide is used as bleaching agent?"},{"output":"Steve Easterbrook","context":"corporate.mcdonalds.com/mcd.html\\r\\nwww.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html\\r\\nMcDonald's was founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, USA. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand. The first time a McDonald's franchise used the Golden Arches logo was in 1953 at the opening of Phoenix, Arizona, USA. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers. McDonald's had its original headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but has approved plans to move its global headquarters to Chicago by 2018.[3][4]\\r\\nMcDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue[5], serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries[6] across approximately 36,900 outlets as of 2016.[7] Although McDonald's is known for its hamburgers, they also sell cheeseburgers, chicken products, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food,[8] the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit. The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. According to a BBC report published in 2012, McDonald's is the world's second largest private employer (behind Walmart with 1.9 million employees), 1.5 million of whom work for franchises.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe siblings Richard and Maurice McDonald opened in 1940 the first McDonald's at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California (at 340732N 1171741W? / ?34.1255N 117.2946W? / 34.1255; -117.2946) but it was not the McDonald's recognizable today; Ray Kroc made changes to the brothers business that modernized it. The brothers introduced the \\"Speedee Service System\\" in 1948 established the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant that their predecessor White Castle had put into practice more than two decades earlier.[citation needed]. The original mascot of McDonald's was a chef hat on top of a hamburger who was referred to as \\"Speedee\\". In 1962, the Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the universal mascot. The symbol, Ronald McDonald, was introduced in 1965. The clown, Ronald McDonald, appeared in advertising to target their audience of children.[9]\\r\\nOn May 4, 1961, McDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name \\"McDonald's\\" with the description \\"Drive-In Restaurant Services\\", which continues to be renewed. By September 13, 1961, McDonald's under the guidance of Ray Kroc, filed for a trademark on a new logoan overlapping, double-arched \\"M\\" symbol. But before the double arches, McDonald's used the a single arch for the architecture of their buildings. Although the \\"Golden Arches\\" logo appeared in various forms, the present version was not used until November 18, 1968, when the company was favored a U.S. trademark.\\r\\nThe present corporation credits its founding to franchised businessman Ray Kroc in on April 15, 1955, this was in fact the ninth opened McDonald's restaurant overall; although this location was destroyed and rebuilt in 1984. Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers' equity in the company and begun the companies worldwide reach. Kroc was recorded as being an aggressive business partner, driving the McDonald brothers out of the industry.\\r\\nKroc and the McDonald brothers fought for control of the business, as documented in Kroc's autobiography. The San Bernardino restaurant was eventually torn down (1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo chain in 1976. This area now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, and a McDonald's and Route 66 museum.[10] With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life. Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer responsibility.\\r\\nMcDonald's restaurants are found in 120 countries and territories around the world and serve 68 million customers each day.[11][12] McDonald's operates 36,899 restaurants worldwide, employing more than 375,000 people as of the end of 2016.[7][11] There are currently a total of 5,669 company-owned locations and 31,230 franchised locations, which includes 21,559 locations franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,300 locations licensed to developmental licensees, and 3,371 locations licensed to foreign affiliates, primarily Japan.[7]\\r\\nFocusing on its core brand, McDonald's began divesting itself of other chains it had acquired during the 1990s. The company owned a majority stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill until October 2006, when McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle through a stock exchange.[13][14] Until December 2003, it also owned Donatos Pizza, and it owned a small share of Aroma Cafe from 1999 to 2001. On August 27, 2007, McDonald's sold Boston Market to Sun Capital Partners.[15]\\r\\nNotably, McDonald's has increased shareholder dividends for 25 consecutive years,[16] making it one of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.[17][18] In October 2012, its monthly sales fell for the first time in nine years.[19] In 2014, its quarterly sales fell for the first time in seventeen years, when its sales dropped for the entirety of 1997.[20]\\r\\nIn the United States, it is reported that drive-throughs account for 70 percent of sales.[21][22] McDonald's closed down 184 restaurants in the United States in 2015, which was 59 more than what they planned to open.[23][24] This move was also the first time McDonald's had a net decrease in the number of locations in the United States since 1970.[24]\\r\\nThe company currently owns all the land, valued at an estimated $16 to $18 billion, on which its restaurants are situated. The company earns a significant portion of its revenue from rental payments from franchisees. These rent payments rose 26 percent between 2010 and 2015, accounting for one-fifth of the company's total revenue at the end of the period.[25] In recent times, there have been calls to spin off the company's US holdings into a potential real estate investment trust, but the company announced at its investor conference on November 10, 2015, that this would not happen. The CEO, Steve Easterbrook discussed that pursuing the REIT option would pose too large a risk to the company's business model.[26]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland business model is different from the U.S, in that fewer than 30 percent of restaurants are franchised, with the majority under the ownership of the company. McDonald's trains its franchisees and management at Hamburger University in Oak Brook, Illinois.[27][28] In other countries, McDonald's restaurants are operated by joint ventures of McDonald's Corporation and other, local entities or governments.[29]\\r\\nAccording to Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser (2001), nearly one in eight workers in the U.S. have at some time been employed by McDonald's. Employees are encouraged by McDonald's Corp. to maintain their health by singing along to their favorite songs in order to relieve stress, attending church services in order to have a lower blood pressure, and taking two vacations annually in order to reduce risk for myocardial infarction.[30] Fast Food Nation also states that McDonald's is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U.S., as well as the single largest purchaser of beef, pork, potatoes, and apples. The selection of meats McDonald's uses varies to some extent based on the culture of the host country.[31]\\r\\nThe McDonald's headquarters complex, McDonald's Plaza, is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. It sits on the site of the former headquarters and stabling area of Paul Butler, the founder of Oak Brook.[32] McDonald's moved into the Oak Brook facility from an office within the Chicago Loop in 1971.[33]\\r\\nOn June 13, 2016, McDonald's confirmed plans to move its global headquarters to Chicago's West Loop neighborhood in the Near West Side. The 608,000-square-foot structure will be built on the former site of Harpo Productions (where the Oprah Winfrey Show and several other Harpo productions taped) and open in early 2018.[3][4]\\r\\nAs of November 2014, the board of directors had the following members:[34]\\r\\nOn March 1, 2015, after being chief brand officer of McDonald's and its former head in the UK and northern Europe, Steve Easterbrook became CEO, succeeding Don Thompson, who stepped down on January 28, 2015.\\r\\nMcDonald's has become emblematic of globalization, sometimes referred to as the \\"McDonaldization\\" of society. The Economist newspaper uses the \\"Big Mac Index\\": the comparison of a Big Mac's cost in various world currencies can be used to informally judge these currencies' purchasing power parity. Switzerland has the most expensive Big Mac in the world as of July 2015, while the country with the least expensive Big Mac is India[35][36] (albeit for a Maharaja Macthe next cheapest Big Mac is Hong Kong).[37]\\r\\nThomas Friedman once said that no country with a McDonald's had gone to war with another.[38][39] However, the \\"Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention\\" is not strictly true. Exceptions are the 1989 United States invasion of Panama, NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2008 South Ossetia war. McDonald's suspended operations in its corporate-owned stores in Crimea after Russia annexed the region in 2014.[40] On August 20, 2014, as tensions between the United States and Russia strained over events in Ukraine, and the resultant U.S. sanctions, the Russian government temporarily shut down four McDonald's outlets in Moscow, citing sanitary concerns. The company has operated in Russia since 1990 and at August 2014 had 438 stores across the country.[41] On August 23, 2014, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich ruled out any government move to ban McDonald's and dismissed the notion that the temporary closures had anything to do with the sanctions.[42]\\r\\nSome observers have suggested that the company should be given credit for increasing the standard of service in markets that it enters. A group of anthropologists in a study entitled Golden Arches East[43] looked at the impact McDonald's had on East Asia and Hong Kong, in particular. When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975, McDonald's was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms, driving customers to demand the same of other restaurants and institutions. McDonald's has taken to partnering up with Sinopec, the second largest oil company in the People's Republic of China, as it takes advantage of the country's growing use of personal vehicles by opening numerous drive-thru restaurants.[44] McDonald's has opened a McDonald's restaurant and McCaf on the underground premises of the French fine arts museum, The Louvre.[45]\\r\\nThe company stated it would open vegetarian-only restaurants in India by mid-2013.[46] Foreign restaurants are banned in Bermuda, with the exception of KFC, which was present before the current law was passed. Therefore, there are no McDonald's in Bermuda.[47][unreliable source?]\\r\\nOn January 9, 2017, 80% of the franchise rights in the mainland China and in Hong Kong were sold for US$2.080 billion to a consortium of CITIC Limited (for 32%) and private equity funds managed by CITIC Capital (for 20%) and Carlyle (for 20%), which CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would also formed a joint venture to own the stake.[48]\\r\\nMcDonald's predominantly sells hamburgers, various types of chicken, chicken sandwiches, French fries, soft drinks, breakfast items, and desserts. In most markets, McDonald's offers salads and vegetarian items, wraps and other localized fare. On a seasonal basis, McDonald's offers the McRib sandwich. Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal.[49]\\r\\nProducts are offered as either \\"eat-in\\" (where the customer opts to eat in the restaurant) or \\"take-out\\" (where the customer opts to take the food for consumption off the premises). \\"Eat-in\\" meals are provided on a plastic tray with a paper insert on the floor of the tray. \\"Take-out\\" meals are usually delivered with the contents enclosed in a distinctive McDonald's-branded brown paper bag. In both cases, the individual items are wrapped or boxed as appropriate.\\r\\nSince Steve Easterbrook became CEO of the company, McDonald's has streamlined the menu which in the United States contained nearly 200 items. The company has also looked to introduce healthier options, and removed high-fructose corn syrup from hamburger buns. The company has also removed artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets,[50] replacing chicken skin, safflower oil and citric acid found in Chicken McNuggets with pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice.[51]\\r\\nRestaurants in several countries, particularly in Asia, serve soup. This local deviation from the standard menu is a characteristic for which the chain is particularly known, and one which is employed either to abide by regional food taboos (such as the religious prohibition of beef consumption in India) or to make available foods with which the regional market is more familiar (such as the sale of McRice in Indonesia, or Ebi (prawn) Burger in Singapore and Japan).\\r\\nIn Germany and some other Western European countries, McDonald's sells beer. In New Zealand, McDonald's sells meat pies, after the local affiliate partially relaunched the Georgie Pie fast food chain it bought out in 1996.\\r\\nIn the United States, after limited trials on a regional basis, McDonald's plans to offer an all-day breakfast menu whenever its restaurants are open, although eggs cannot be cooked at the same time on the same equipment as hamburgers due to different temperature requirements.[citation needed]\\r\\nMost standalone McDonald's restaurants offer both counter service and drive-through service, with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating.[52] Drive-Thru, Auto-Mac, Pay and Drive, or \\"McDrive\\" as it is known in many countries, often has separate stations for placing, paying for, and picking up orders, though the latter two steps are frequently combined;[52] it was first introduced in Arizona in 1975, following the lead of other fast-food chains. The first such restaurant in Britain opened at Fallowfield, Manchester in 1986.[53]\\r\\nIn some countries, \\"McDrive\\" locations near highways offer no counter service or seating.[54] In contrast, locations in high-density city neighborhoods often omit drive-through service.[55] There are also a few locations, located mostly in downtown districts, that offer a \\"Walk-Thru\\" service in place of Drive-Thru.[56]\\r\\nMcCaf is a caf-style accompaniment to McDonald's restaurants and is a concept created by McDonald's Australia (also known, and marketed, as \\"Macca's\\" in Australia), starting with Melbourne in 1993.[57] As of 2016, most McDonald's in Australia have McCafs located within the existing McDonald's restaurant. In Tasmania, there are McCafs in every restaurant, with the rest of the states quickly following suit.[52] After upgrading to the new McCaf look and feel, some Australian restaurants have noticed up to a 60 percent increase in sales. At the end of 2003, there were over 600 McCafs worldwide.\\r\\nFrom 2015ÿ2016, McDonald's tried a new gourmet burger service/restaurant concept based on other gourmet restaurants such as Shake Shack and Grill'd. It was rolled out for the first time in Australia during the early months of 2015 and expanded to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Arabia and New Zealand, with ongoing trials in the US market. In dedicated \\"Create Your Taste\\" (CYT) kiosks, customers could choose all ingredients including type of bun and meat along with optional extras. In late 2015 the Australian CYT service introduced CYT salads.\\r\\nAfter a person had ordered, McDonald's advised that wait times were between 10ÿ15 minutes. When the food was ready, trained crew ('hosts') brought the food to the customer's table. Instead of McDonald's usual cardboard and plastic packaging, CYT food was presented on wooden boards, fries in wire baskets and salads in china bowls with metal cutlery. A higher price applied.\\r\\nIn November 2016, Create Your Taste was replaced by a \\"Signature Crafted Recipes\\" program designed to be more efficient and less expensive.[58]\\r\\nSome locations are connected to gas stations/convenience stores,[59] while others called McExpress have limited seating and/or menu or may be located in a shopping mall. Other McDonald's are located in Walmart stores. McStop is a location targeted at truckers and travelers which may have services found at truck stops.[60]\\r\\nIn Sweden, customers who order a happy meal can use the meal's container for a pair of happy goggles.[61] The company created a game for the goggles known as \\"Slope Stars.[61]\\" McDonald's predicts happy goggles will continue in other countries.[61] In the Netherlands, McDonald's has introduced McTrax that doubles as a recording studio; it reacts to touch.[61] They can create their own beats with a synth and tweak sounds with special effects.[61]\\r\\nThe first kosher McDonald's was established in 1997 at the Abasto de Buenos Aires mall in Buenos Aires, Argentina. There are also many kosher branches in Israel.[62][63]\\r\\nMcDonald's playgrounds are called McDonald's PlayPlace. Some McDonald's in suburban areas and certain cities feature large indoor or outdoor playgrounds. The first PlayPlace with the familiar crawl-tube design with ball pits and slides was introduced in 1987 in the US, with many more being constructed soon after.\\r\\nMcDonald's Next use open-concept design and offer \\"Create Your Taste\\" digital ordering. The concept store also offering free mobile device charging and table service after 6:00 pm. The first store open in Hong Kong in December 2015.[64]\\r\\nIn 2006, McDonald's introduced its \\"Forever Young\\" brand by redesigning all of its restaurants, the first major redesign since the 1970s.[65][66]\\r\\nThe goal of the redesign is to be more like a coffee shop, similar to Starbucks. The design includes wooden tables, faux-leather chairs, and muted colors; the red was muted to terracotta, the yellow was shifted to golden for a more \\"sunny\\" look, and olive and sage green were also added.\\r\\nTo create a warmer look, the restaurants have less plastic and more brick and wood, with modern hanging lights to produce a softer glow. Many restaurants now feature free Wi-Fi and flat-screen TVs. Other upgrades include double drive-thrus, flat roofs instead of the angled red roofs, and replacing fiber glass with wood. Also, instead of the familiar golden arches, the restaurants now feature \\"semi-swooshes\\" (half of a golden arch), similar to the Nike swoosh.[67]\\r\\nMcDonald's began banning smoking in 1994 when it banned smoking within its 1,400 wholly owned restaurants.[68]\\r\\nSince the late 1990s, McDonald's has attempted to replace employees with electronic kiosks which would perform actions such taking orders and accepting money. In 1999, McDonald's first tested \\"E-Clerks\\" in suburban Chicago, Illinois, and Wyoming, Michigan, with the devices being able to \\"save money on live staffers\\" and attracting larger purchase amounts than average employees.[69]\\r\\nIn 2013, the University of Oxford estimated that in the succeeding decades, there was a 92% probability of food preparation and serving to become automated in fast food establishments.[70] By 2016, McDonald's \\"Create Your Taste\\" electronic kiosks were seen in some restaurants internationally where customers could custom order meals. As employees pushed for higher wages in the late-2010s, some believed that fast food companies such as McDonald's would use the devices to cut costs for employing individuals.[71]\\r\\nOn August 5, 2013, The Guardian revealed that 90 percent of McDonald's UK workforce are on zero hour contracts, making it possibly the largest such private sector employer in the country.[72] A study released by Fast Food Forward conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove Research showed that approximately 84 percent of all fast food employees working in New York City in April 2013 had been paid less than their legal wages by their employers.[73]\\r\\nFrom 2007 to 2011, fast food workers in the US drew an average of $7 billion of public assistance annually resulting from receiving low wages.[74] The McResource website advised employees to break their food into smaller pieces to feel fuller, seek refunds for unopened holiday purchases, sell possessions online for quick cash, and to \\"quit complaining\\" as \\"stress hormone levels rise by 15 percent after ten minutes of complaining.\\"[75] In December 2013, McDonald's shut down the McResource website amidst negative publicity and criticism. McDonald's plans to continue an internal telephone help line through which its employees can obtain advice on work and life problems.[76]\\r\\nLiberal thinktank the Roosevelt Institute accuses some McDonald's restaurants of actually paying less than the minimum wage to entry positions due to 'rampant' wage theft.[77] In South Korea, McDonald's pays part-time employees $5.50 an hour and is accused of paying less with arbitrary schedules adjustments and pay delays.[78] In late 2015, Anonymous aggregated data collected by Glassdoor suggests that McDonald's in the United States pays entry-level employees between $7.25 an hour and $11 an hour, with an average of $8.69 an hour. Shift managers get paid an average of $10.34 an hour. Assistant managers get paid an average of $11.57 an hour.[79] McDonald's CEO, Steve Easterbrook, currently earns an annual salary of $1,100,000.[80]\\r\\nMcDonald's workers have on occasions decided to strike over pay, with most of the employees on strike seeking to be paid $15.00.[81] When interviewed about the strikes occurring, former McDonald's CEO Ed Rensi stated: \\"It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who's inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries\\" with Rensi explaining that increasing employee wages could possibly take away from entry-level jobs.[82] However, according to Easterbrook, increasing wages and benefits for workers saw a 6% increase in customer satisfaction when comparing 2015's first quarter data to the first quarter of 2016, with greater returns seen as a result.[82]\\r\\nIn September 2017, two British McDonald's stores agreed to a strike over zero hours contracts for staff. Picket lines were formed around the two stores in Crayford and Cambridge. The strike was supported by the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.[83][84]\\r\\nIn March 2015, McDonald's workers in 19 US cities filed 28 health and safety complaints with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration which allege that low staffing, lack of protective gear, poor training and pressure to work fast has resulted in injuries. The complaints also allege that, because of a lack of first aid supplies, workers were told by management to treat burn injuries with condiments such as mayonnaise and mustard.[85] The Fight for $15 labor organization aided the workers in filing the complaints.[86]\\r\\nIn 2015, McDonald's pledged to stop using eggs from battery cage facilities by 2025. Since McDonald's purchases over 2 billion eggs per year or 4 percent of eggs produced in the United States, the switch is expected to have a major impact on the egg industry and is part of a general trend toward cage-free eggs driven by consumer concern over the harsh living conditions of hens.[87][88] The aviary systems from which the new eggs will be sourced are troubled by much higher mortality rates, as well as introducing environmental and worker safety problems.[89] The high hen mortality rate, which is more than double that of battery cage systems, will require new research to mitigate. The facilities also have higher ammonia levels due to faeces being kicked up into the air. Producers raised concerns about the production cost, which is expected to increase by 36 percent.[90]\\r\\nMcDonald's continues to source pork from facilities that use gestation crates, and in 2012 pledged to phase them out.[91]\\r\\nMcDonald's has for decades maintained an extensive advertising campaign. In addition to the usual media (television, radio, and newspaper), the company makes significant use of billboards and signage, sponsors sporting events ranging from Little League to the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games.[92] Television has played a central role in the company's advertising strategy.[93] To date, McDonald's has used 23 different slogans in United States advertising, as well as a few other slogans for select countries and regions.[94]\\r\\nMcDonald's and NASA explored an advertising agreement for a planned mission to the asteroid 449 Hamburga; however, the spacecraft was eventually cancelled.[95]\\r\\nMcDonald's is the title sponsor of the McDonald's All-American Game, all-star basketball games played each year for American and Canadian boys' and girls' high school basketball graduates.\\r\\nMcHappy Day is an annual event at McDonald's, where a percentage of the day's sales go to charity. It is the signature fundraising event for Ronald McDonald House Charities.[96]\\r\\nIn 2007, it was celebrated in 17 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, the United States, Finland, France, Guatemala, Hungary, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Uruguay.\\r\\nAccording to the Australian McHappy Day website, McHappy Day raised $20.4 million in 2009. The goal for 2010 was $20.8 million.[97]\\r\\nIn 1995, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald's Monopoly game piece. McDonald's officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, who examined the card under a jeweler's eyepiece, handled it with plastic gloves, and verified it as a winner.[98] Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, McDonald's waived the rule and has made the annual $50,000 annuity payments, even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald's (see McDonald's Monopoly).\\r\\nMcRefugees are poor people in Hong Kong, Japan, and China who use McDonald's 24-hour restaurants as a temporary hostel. One in five of Hong Kong's population lives below the poverty line. The rise of McRefugees was first documented by photographer Suraj Katra in 2013.[99]\\r\\nIn 1990, activists from a small group known as London Greenpeace (no connection to the international group Greenpeace) distributed leaflets entitled What's wrong with McDonald's?, criticizing its environmental, health, and labor record. The corporation wrote to the group demanding they desist and apologize, and, when two of the activists refused to back down, sued them for libel in one of the longest cases in British civil law. A documentary film of the McLibel Trial has been shown in several countries.[100]\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, Phil Sokolof, a millionaire businessman who had suffered a heart attack at the age of 43, took out full-page newspaper ads in New York, Chicago, and other large cities accusing McDonald's menu of being a threat to American health, and asking them to stop using beef tallow to cook their french fries.[101]\\r\\nDespite the objections of McDonald's, the term \\"McJob\\" was added to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2003.[102] The term was defined as \\"a low-paying job that requires little skill and provides little opportunity for advancement\\".[103]\\r\\nIn 2001, Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation included criticism of the business practices of McDonald's. Among the critiques were allegations that McDonald's (along with other companies within the fast food industry) uses its political influence to increase its profits at the expense of people's health and the social conditions of its workers. The book also brought into question McDonald's advertisement techniques in which it targets children. While the book did mention other fast-food chains, it focused primarily on McDonald's.\\r\\nIn 2002, vegetarian groups, largely Hindu and Buddhist, successfully sued McDonald's for misrepresenting its French fries as vegetarian, when they contained beef broth.[104]\\r\\nMorgan Spurlock's 2004 documentary film Super Size Me claimed that McDonald's food was contributing to the increase of obesity in society and that the company was failing to provide nutritional information about its food for its customers. Six weeks after the film premiered, McDonald's announced that it was eliminating the super size option, and was creating the adult Happy Meal.\\r\\nIn 2006, an unsanctioned McDonald's Videogame was released online. It is parody of the business practices of the corporate giant, taking the guise of a tycoon style business simulation game. In the game, the player plays the role of a McDonald's CEO, choosing whether or not to use controversial practices like genetically altered cow feed, plowing over rainforests, and corrupting public officials. McDonald's issued a statement distancing itself from the game.[105]\\r\\nIn January 2014, it was reported that McDonald's was accused of having used a series of tax maneuvers to avoid taxes in France. The company confirmed that tax authorities had visited McDonald's French headquarters in Paris but insisted that it had not done anything wrong, saying, \\"McDonald's firmly denies the accusation made by L'Express according to which McDonald's supposedly hid part of its revenue from taxes in France.\\"[106]\\r\\nIn response to public pressure, McDonald's has sought to include more healthy choices in its menu and has introduced a new slogan to its recruitment posters: \\"Not bad for a McJob\\".[107] The word McJob, first attested in the mid-1980s[102] and later popularized by Canadian novelist Douglas Coupland in his book Generation X, has become a buzz word for low-paid, unskilled work with few prospects or benefits and little security. McDonald's disputes this definition of McJob. In 2007, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan \\"Would you like a career with that?\\" on Irish television, asserting that its jobs have good prospects.\\r\\nIn an effort to respond to growing consumer awareness of food provenance, the fast-food chain changed its supplier of both coffee beans and milk. UK chief executive Steve Easterbrook said: \\"British consumers are increasingly interested in the quality, sourcing, and ethics of the food and drink they buy\\".[108] In a bid to tap into the ethical consumer market,[109] McDonald's switched to using coffee beans taken from stocks that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance, a conservation group. Additionally, in response to pressure, McDonald's UK started using organic milk supplies for its bottled milk and hot drinks, although it still uses conventional milk in its milkshakes, and in all of its dairy products in the United States.[110] According to a report published by Farmers Weekly in 2007, the quantity of milk used by McDonald's could have accounted for as much as 5 percent of the UK's organic milk output.[111]\\r\\nMcDonald's announced on May 22, 2008, that, in the United States and Canada, it would switch to using cooking oil that contains no trans fats for its french fries, and canola-based oil with corn and soy oils, for its baked items, pies and cookies, by year's end.[112][113]\\r\\nWith regard to acquiring chickens from suppliers who use CAK/CAS methods of slaughter, McDonald's says that it needs to see more research \\"to help determine whether any CAS system in current use is optimal from an animal welfare perspective.\\"[114]\\r\\nIn April 2008, McDonald's announced that 11 of its Sheffield, England restaurants have been engaged in a biomass trial that had cut its waste and carbon footprint by half in the area. In this trial, wastes from the restaurants were collected by Veolia Environmental Services and were used to produce energy at a power plant. McDonald's plans to expand this project, although the lack of biomass power plants in the United States will prevent this plan from becoming a national standard anytime soon.[115] In addition, in Europe, McDonald's has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for its diesel trucks.[116]\\r\\nMcDonald's has been using a corn-based bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products. The environmental benefits of this technology are controversial, with critics noting that biodegradation is slow, produces greenhouse gases and that contamination of traditional plastic waste streams with bioplastics can complicate recycling efforts.[117]\\r\\nIn 1990, McDonald's worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to stop using \\"clam shell\\" shaped styrofoam food containers to house its food products.[118] 20 years later, McDonald's announced they would try replacing styrofoam coffee cups with an alternative material.[119]\\r\\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized McDonald's continuous effort to reduce solid waste by designing more efficient packaging and by promoting the use of recycled-content materials.[120] McDonald's reports that it is committed towards environmental leadership by effectively managing electric energy, by conserving natural resources through recycling and reusing materials, and by addressing water management issues within the restaurant.[121]\\r\\nIn an effort to reduce energy usage by 25 percent in its restaurants, McDonald's opened a prototype restaurant in Chicago in 2009 with the intention of using the model in its other restaurants throughout the world. Building on past efforts, specifically a restaurant it opened in Sweden in 2000 that was the first to intentionally incorporate green ideas, McDonald's designed the Chicago site to save energy by incorporating old and new ideas such as managing storm water, using skylights for more natural lighting and installing some partitions and tabletops made from recycled goods.[122]\\r\\nWhen McDonald's received criticism for its environmental policies in the 1970s, it began to make substantial progress in reducing its use of materials.[123] For instance, an \\"average meal\\" in the 1970sa Big Mac, fries, and a drinkrequired 46?grams of packaging; today, it requires only 25?grams, allowing a 46 percent reduction.[124] In addition, McDonald's eliminated the need for intermediate containers for cola by having a delivery system that pumps syrup directly from the delivery truck into storage containers, saving two million pounds (910 tonnes) of packaging annually.[125] Overall, weight reductions in packaging and products, as well as the increased usage of bulk packaging ultimately decreased packaging by twenty-four million pounds (11,000 tonnes) annually.[126]\\r\\nMcDonald's has been involved in a number of lawsuits and other legal cases, most of which involved trademark disputes. The company has threatened many food businesses with legal action unless it drops the Mc or Mac from trading names.\\r\\nOn September 8, 2009, McDonald's Malaysian operations lost a lawsuit to prevent another restaurant calling itself McCurry. McDonald's lost in an appeal to Malaysia's highest court, the Federal Court.[127]\\r\\nIn April 2007, in Perth, Western Australia, McDonald's pleaded guilty to five charges relating to the employment of children under 15 in one of its outlets and was fined A$8,000.[128]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Australian Taxation Office revealed that McDonald's Asia-Pacific Consortium had generated $478 million in revenue in 2013ÿ14, but had paid no tax on those earnings whatsoever.[129]\\r\\nMcDonald's has defended itself in several cases involving workers' rights.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe longest running legal action of all time in the UK was the McLibel case against 2 defendants who criticized a number of aspects of the company. The trial lasted 10 years and called 130 witnesses. The European Court of Human Rights deemed that the unequal resources of the litigants breached the defendants rights to freedom of speech and biased the trial. The result was widely seen as a \\"PR disaster.\\"[130]\\r\\nA famous legal case in the US involving McDonald's was the 1994 decision in Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants where Stella Liebeck was awarded several million dollars after she suffered third-degree burns after spilling a scalding cup of McDonald's coffee on herself.[131]\\r\\nIn April 2014, it was reported that McDonald's in Europe will use chicken meat that was produced by using genetically modified animal feed. Greenpeace argues that McDonald's saves less than one Eurocent for each chicken burger and goes down a path not desired by its customers.[132]","input":"Who is the current ceo of mcdonald's corporation?"},{"output":"Flying Down to Rio","context":"Fred Astaire (May 10, 1899- June 22, 1987) and Ginger Rogers (July 16, 1911- April 25, 1995) were iconic dance partners who made motion pictures together from 1933ÿ1949. They made a total of 10 movies, 9 with RKO Radio Pictures and one, The Barkleys of Broadway, with M-G-M, their only color (Technicolor) movie.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAstaire started dancing in the early 1900s as a child on stage, in Vaudeville, partnering with his older sister, Adele.[2] He made his first movie in 1933, taking on a small role in the movie Dancing Lady starring Clark Gable and Joan Crawford. Rogers made her first appearance in a 1929 movie short, then made feature Pre-Code movies with Warner Brothers Pictures such as 42nd Street and Gold Diggers of 1933. Astaire and Rogers made their first pairing in a movie in 1933, Flying Down to Rio, in which they had supporting roles; the main star was Dolores Del Rio. In 1934, Astaire and Rogers made the musical movie The Gay Divorcee which co-starred Edward Everett Horton; it was their first joint starring role in a movie; the movie also featured the classic Cole Porter song \\"Night and Day\\". The song \\"The Continental\\" from the movie was a hit and was also the first song to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song in the 1934 Academy Awards.\\r\\nAstaire and Rogers made two movies in 1935, Roberta, which featured the song \\"I Won't Dance\\" and Top Hat, which also co-starred comedian Edward Everett Horton. In Roberta, Astaire and Rogers had a supporting role with Irene Dunne starring. In this film the song and dance, \\"I'll Be Hard to Handle\\", was an early example of the electricity and vivacity of the pairing. Top Hat marked the first time the duo had a film written solely for them, and it proved to be one of the most successful films of the year.[3] It was also, with The Gay Divorcee, among the most profitable films RKO Radio Pictures made in the 1930s.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy 1936, Astaire and Rogers were top box office names. That year they made another two movies together: Follow the Fleet and Swing Time, which were both hits. Swing Time spawned the Oscar-winning song \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\", written by Jerome Kern with lyrics by Dorothy Fields, which Astaire sang to Rogers. John Mueller has cited Swing Time for possessing \\"the greatest dancing in the history of the universe.\\".[4] The dance sequences for \\"Swing Time\\" (e.g. \\"Never Gonna Dance\\")[5] are considered by Arlene Croce to be the high point of their art.[6] This scene took 47 takes to perfect, during which the dancers had to ascend stairs, spinning, until they perfected it. By the end of the shoot, Rogers' feet were bleeding.[7] Follow the Fleet boasted another Irving Berlin score, which featured the well known vignette \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance\\".\\r\\n1937 featured only one movie for Astaire and Rogers, Shall We Dance, which co-starred Edward Everett Horton. Although the film was mildly successful, it did not perform as well as expected by the studio.[8] Shall We Dance had the first Hollywood score by the brothers George and Ira Gershwin, and included the song \\"They Can't Take That Away from Me\\". Although Astaire and Rogers would go on to make two more films together for RKO, the film's comparative disappointment in the box office was the beginning of the end for their partnership.\\r\\nAfter an unusually long period apart, Astaire and Rogers made only one movie together in 1938, the 80-minute Carefree.[9] During their time apart, Rogers appeared in the successful movie Stage Door, while Astaire's career did not reach the same heights he had experienced with Rogers.[10] The duo reunited, but Carefree marked a departure for their on-screen partnership, featuring Astaire in a role unlike his usual typecast persona, as well as less emphasis on the musical element of the film.[10] Carefree was originally going to contain sequences shot in Technicolor, but RKO considered the cost prohibitive so it was filmed in black and white.[9] This movie feature an Irving Berlin musical score with only four songs, the fewest in any Astaire and Rogers film.[11] While the film was well-received by critics, with Motion Picture Herald's William R. Weaver calling it \\"the greatest Astaire-Rogers picture\\", it ultimately lost money for the studio.[9]\\r\\nIn 1939, Astaire and Rogers made The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle. It was the end of their partnership for ten years, until they reunited for The Barkleys of Broadway. Although their relationship was amicable, both wanted to explore new avenues. Rogers was interested in more dramatic roles than those she was offered with Astaire. Meanwhile Astaire, who worked with many dancers throughout his career, no longer wanted to be paired with one permanent partner.[12] Despite several successful films, RKO was facing bankruptcy. Due to the high cost and low profit of recent Astaire-Rogers vehicles, along with the stars' mutual desire to branch out, RKO announced the end of the on-screen partnership.[13] Their farewell film was a musical biography of ballroom dancers Vernon and Irene Castle. When Astaire and Rogers filmed the last dance in this film, Missouri Waltz, they attracted a large crowd of co-workers and crew members from RKO and numerous other studios, all of whom attended to bid an emotional farewell to the great dance team.[14]\\r\\nRogers had long been keen to pursue more dramatic roles, which she successfully managed after her split from Astaire. At the 1941 Academy Awards ceremony, Rogers won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Kitty Foyle[15] and by the mid-1940s she was the highest paid actress in Hollywood, although her career waned post war.[16]\\r\\nAstaire continued to make musicals including Holiday Inn (1942) with Bing Crosby, Sky's The Limit (1943) with Joan Leslie and Blue Skies (1946), his second and last movie with Crosby. He also partnered with numerous other dancers, including Rita Hayworth, Cyd Charisse and Judy Garland.[2] Fearing his career was failing, Blue Skies was due to be Astaire's last film, after which he retired for two years.[17] In 1948 Gene Kelly was due to star in MGM's Easter Parade alongside Judy Garland, but he broke his ankle, and MGM convinced Astaire to fill in, ending his retirement.[18]\\r\\nDue to their success as a partnership, Garland and Astaire were due to reunite for The Barkleys of Broadway, but Garland was forced to drop out and Rogers took her place.[19] The film, released in 1949, reunited Astaire and Rogers for their only movie for MGM and their only color film.[1] During production, Astaire received an honorary Academy Award, which was presented to him by Rogers. This film was greeted with joy by critics, who were thrilled to see the partnership together once again.[20] It was a success, earning a worldwide total of $5,421,000 on an estimated budget of $2,325,420.[21] The Barkleys of Broadway would be Astaire and Rogers' final movie together, although both would continue to make films with other stars.[22] In the 50s, Rogers' movie career declined due to a move away from classic film stars, but Astaire remained in the industry and branched out into television.[2]","input":"What was fred astaire and ginger rogers first movie together?"},{"output":"Yellow River valley","context":"","input":"Where was the original birthplace of the chinese civilization?"},{"output":"Alaska","context":"This is a complete list of the states of the United States and its major territories ordered by total area, land area, and water area.

Inspired by the McDonald brothers' original store location in San Bernardino, California, the founders and owners, Keith J. Kramer and his wife's uncle Matthew Burns, began searching for a concept. After purchasing the rights to two pieces of equipment called \\"Insta\\" machines, the two opened their first stores around a cooking device known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, they required all of their franchises to carry the device. After the original company began to falter in 1959, it was purchased by its Miami, Florida, franchisees James McLamore and David R. Edgerton. The two initiated a corporate restructuring of the chain; the first step being to rename the company Burger King. The duo ran the company as an independent entity for eight years, eventually expanding to over 250 locations in the United States, when they sold it to the Pillsbury Company in 1967.\\r\\nPillsbury's management made several attempts at reorganization or restructuring of the restaurant chain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. In a plan called Operation Phoenix, Smith initiated a restructuring of corporate business practices at all levels of the company. Changes to the company included updated franchise agreements, a broadening of the menu, and new store designs to standardize the look and feel of the company. While these efforts were initially effective, many of them were eventually discarded, resulting in Burger King falling into a fiscal slump that damaged the financial performance of both Burger King and its parent. Poor operating performance and ineffectual leadership continued to bog the company down for many years, even after it was acquired in 1989 by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan and its successor Diageo. Eventually, the institutional neglect of the brand by Diageo damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the loss-making chain and put the company up for sale in 2000.\\r\\nIn the twenty-first century the company returned to independence when it was purchased from Diageo by a group of investment firms led by TPG Capital for $1.5?billion (USD) in 2002. The new owners rapidly moved to revitalize and reorganize the company, culminating with the company being taken public in 2006 with a highly successful initial public offering. The firms' strategy for turning the chain around included a new advertising agency and new ad campaigns, a revamped menu strategy, a series of programs designed to revamp individual stores, and a new restaurant concept called the BK Whopper Bar. These changes re-energized the company. Despite the successes of the new owners, the effects of the financial crisis of 2007ÿ2010 weakened the company's financial outlooks while those of its immediate competitor McDonald's grew. The falling value of Burger King eventually lead to TPG and its partners divesting their interest in the chain in a $3.26?billion (USD) sale to 3G Capital of Brazil. Analysts from financial firms UBS and Stifel Nicolaus agreed that 3G will have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. After the deal was completed, the company's stock was removed from the New York Stock Exchange, ending a four-year period as a public company. The delisting of its stock was designed to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald's without having to worry about pleasing shareholders. 3G later took the company public again after a series of changes to its operations and structure. Burger King would eventually be merged with Canadian-based donut and coffee chain Tim Hortons, igniting a political controversy in the United States over tax inversions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBurger King was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King by Keith J. Kramer and his wife's uncle, Matthew Burns. Their first stores were centred around a piece of equipment known as the Insta-Broiler, which was very effective at cooking burgers. It proved so successful that, as they grew through franchising, they required all of their franchises to carry the device.[2]\\r\\nWhile the Jacksonville chain kept expanding, two friends named James McLamore and David R. Edgerton, both alumni of the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, were seeking an opportunity to open their own business. McLamore had visited the original hamburger stand belonging to Dick and Mac McDonald in San Bernardino, California, and sensing potential in their innovative assembly line-based production system, decided to open a similar operation.[2][3]\\r\\nMcLamore and Edgerton acquired a license to operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different way inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain link conveyor over the heating elements, a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal grill. The new unit worked so well that they made the decision to replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.[2][3]\\r\\nEven though the original Insta-Burger King had rapidly expanded throughout the state and its operations totaled more than 40 locations by 1955, the group ran into financial difficulties. McLamore and Edgarton purchased the national rights to the chain in 1959 and rechristened the company as Burger King of Miami.[4] The company eventually became known as Burger King Corporation and began selling territorial licenses to private franchisees across the US by 1959.[5]\\r\\nBesides the creation of the company's signature piece of equipment, the flame broiler, the company added two more features during this period that have since become closely associated with the chain. The first to be created was its mascot, the Burger King in 1955.[6] The character would become a staple of its advertising over the next 60 years. The second creation was the company's signature sandwich, the Whopper. It was created in 1957 by James McLamore and originally sold for 37 cents.[7][8] McLamore created the burger after he noticed that a rival restaurant was having success selling a larger burger. Believing that the success of the rival product was its size, he devised the Whopper. The name was chosen because he felt that it conveyed \\"imagery of something big\\".[9] Finally, the company made its first forays into advertising in the new medium of television with commercials for the chain in 1958.[6]\\r\\nIn 1967, the Pillsbury Company acquired Burger King and its parent company Burger King Corporation from McLamore and Edgerton. At the time of the purchase, BK had grown to 274 restaurants in the United States and had an estimated value of US$18?million. With the acquisition, Pillsbury was faced with a lack of consistency within the franchise framework. The Burger King Corporation franchising system set up by McLamore and Edgerton allowed the company to expand a great pace, but the lack of contractual restraints and controls on its franchisee operation led to inconsistencies in its products that in turn were a drag on the reputation of the chain. Additionally, the agreements gave the company too little power to prevent its franchises from doing as they wished with the business.[5]\\r\\nOne of the prime examples of the deficiencies in its former franchise structure can be illustrated by the relationship between Burger King and a Louisiana-based franchisee. Chart House, owned by brothers Billy and Jimmy Trotter, opened its first BK franchise in that state in 1963. By 1970 the Trotters' company had grown to over 350 stores across the country, with its own purchasing system, training program and inspection system. In 1973 Chart House attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for $100?million, but Pillsbury declined. The Trotters then put forth a second plan that would have Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective holdings and merge the two entities into a separate jointly controlled company, which Pillsbury also declined. After the failed bids, the relationship between Pilsbury and the Trotters soured. When Chart House purchased several restaurants in Boston and Houston in 1979, Burger King sued the selling franchisees for not respecting their contractual right of first refusal and won, preventing the sale. The two parties eventually reach a settlement where Chart House kept the Houston locations in their portfolio.[5] In the early 1980s Chart House spun off its Burger King restaurants to focus on its higher end chains; its Burger King holding company, DiversiFoods, was eventually acquired by Pillsbury $390?million in 1984 and folded into Burger King's operations.[10][11]\\r\\nWith the ongoing conflict with Chart House on the mind of the company's board in 1978, Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements. New owners were barred from living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, corporations were not permitted to own franchises, and franchisees could no longer operate other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had.[12] It also became a requirement for the corporation to own the properties of any new store and lease them to franchisees. This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies.[5] Beyond the changes to the franchise system, Smith also restructured Burger King's corporate operations to better compete against his former employer as well as then up and coming chain Wendy's. He broadened the product offering by adding the Burger King specialty sandwich line in 1979, and also added many non-hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings. The new line was one of the first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing spend more on a higher quality product.[4] The new products were successful and the company's sales increased by 15%.[5]\\r\\nAfter Smith's departure from the company for soft drinks producer PepsiCo in 1980,[13] the company began to see a system-wide decline in sales. Pillsbury executive vice president of restaurant operations Norman E. Brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival, McDonald's. One of his first acts was to initiate an advertising plan emphasizing claims that Burger King's flame-broiled burgers were better and larger than its rival's. The program, arguably the first attack ads on a food chain by a competitor, was controversial in that before it fast food ads only made allusions to the competition without ever mentioning them by name. McDonald's sued Burger King, their ad agency at the time J. Walter Thompson. The child actress Sarah Michelle Gellar was also implicated in the lawsuit because of her appearance in these television commercials. The suit was settled the following year on undisclosed terms.[14] Despite the controversy, the ad plan, dubbed the Burger Wars, boosted same store sales.[15] Brinker continued working for the company in this capacity until 1982 when he was promoted to president of Pillsbury's food service division, which included the company's other chains beyond Burger King.[16] Brinker left the company in 1984 to take the helm at Dallas-based gourmet burger chain Chili's.\\r\\nWith the departure of Smith and Brinker, Pillsbury allowed many of their changes to be relaxed, as well as scaled back on construction of new locations which had the effect of stalling corporate growth.[17] By failing to follow through on the changes of the two men, Pillsbury caused its own value to diminish as it derived more than one third of its sales and two thirds of its profits from the burger chain. When the British alcoholic beverages company Grand Metropolitan PLC made a hostile bid for Pillsbury, the company devised a plan to spin off the financially flailing restaurant unit in hopes to raise an estimated US$2?billion that could be used to fend off the unwanted suitor. The complex potentially tax-free stock split plan would have led to the chain, along with its distribution system Distron, becoming a separate entity for the first time in over twenty years.[18][19]\\r\\nHoping that the special dividends created by the spin-off would have convinced shareholders not to accept the hostile bid, Pillsbury had its plans partially scuttled when the company's franchisees rejected the plan despite parts of which that would have given the franchises part ownership in the company and a seat on its new board. In a letter to Pillsbury chairman Phillip L. Smith, franchise representative Bill N. Pothitos stated that franchisees disapproved of the transaction on the grounds that they \\"strongly oppose this proposed course of conduct for one reason and one reason alone: It so restricts the ability of the Burger King Corporation to engage in future competitive growth and reinvestment in the Burger King system that our economic interests and investments will be placed in jeopardy.\\"[20][21] Another option floated by the company in December 1988 was to sell Burger King to a third party, a proposal that drew a favorable response from its franchises, never came to fruition.[22]\\r\\nOn top of the failure of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of lawsuits complicated the divestiture.[23] Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the legality of the stock tender plan was questioned.[23] These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up its bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.[23][24]\\r\\nBetween the time of the initial sales agreement in November 1988 and the finalization of the acquisition of Pillsbury in January 1989, Grand Metropolitan set about putting its own corporate stamp on Burger King; the stated goal of Grand Met CEO Allen Sheppard was to upgrade the overall performance of the chain and improve its standing as the second largest fast-food burger chain globally. To that end, he had the company initiate a three-prong strategy of evaluation of operations, personnel moves, and structural changes and improvements to fortify the company.[25]\\r\\nFollowing through on the CEO's opinion that the company needed a consistent marketing plan and management team to succeed,[26] the company began its moves by replacing its chairman and CEO Jerry W. Levin with its own choice of executives, Barry J. Gibbons, chairman and managing director of Grand Metropolitan Retailing, Ltd., as chief executive and Ian A. Martin, Grand Met's top executive in the United States, as chairman. The moves came to no surprise to Wall Street analysts and franchisees, as they were expected due to reservations about Levin after his appointment by the outgoing management at Pillsbury.[27] Grand Met's first major restructuring move was the dismantling of Burger Kings 50-year-old purchasing and distribution arm, Distron. Unhappy with the distribution group, the company originally thought to dispose of the division after the purchase but instead decided to reorganize it into two separate groups, one for procurement (Burger King Purchasing or BKP) and another for distribution (Burger King Distribution Services or BKDS). With the restructuring, the company eliminated many positions and ended up laying off over a hundred staff members as a consequence.[28][29][30]\\r\\nDuring the five years that led up to the purchase, the restaurant chain had a series of a half dozen ad programs accompanied by even more marketing directors, a situation that led Adweek to describe it as \\"ill-conceived marketing and downright sloppy strategic planning\\" in 1987. In order to reverse the trend, in December 1988 Grand Met set about reevaluating all aspects of the programs from the messages the company was sending to the customer through its commercials to the possibility of dropping its advertising agency of record, N. W. Ayer.[31] After a six-month evaluation, BK dropped Ayer in favor of a two-way combination of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles (DMB&B) for overall programs and Saatchi & Saatchi for specific advertising programs such as the introduction of new products. The company hoped that the \\"dual-agency partnership\\" would provide a synergy that would bring together \\"some of the best minds in the advertising business\\" to establish a brand identity, or as a company spokesman stated, \\"what the consumers take away with them after they visit us--what we stand for...\\"[32]\\r\\nGrand Met also made several moves in an attempt to broaden BK's business operations while expanding its presence globally. The first move by the company was the creation of the BK Expressway business concept, a new store format designed for locations where a traditional stand-alone restaurant was impractical. The company introduced two separate formats designed to operate in different business environments; the first concept was intended as a kiosk-type store that would be placed in locations such as sports venues and airports. The second concept store, designed with two drive-thrus and a minimal or even non-existent dining room, was designed to go in locations that were limited by high land costs or limited space. Both types of these new, smaller stores operated with a condensed menu prepared on new equipment designed specifically for the more compact footprints of the new locations. Expressway locations were also designed with lower start-up costs in mind; franchisees were wooed with the promise of a much smaller investment, approximately one third as much, than would be required to open a more traditional location.[33] In August of the same year, Grand Met set about expanding Burger King's operations in Europe by acquiring UK-based United Biscuits restaurant operations, including the nearly 400-location burger chain Wimpy. With the purchase, described as a \\"rare opportunity\\" by CEO Sheppard, Grand Met set about converting certain Wimpy locations that employed a counter service system into Burger King locations.[34] The merger of the United Biscuits properties with BK grew the company from about 30 restaurants in the UK to more than 60 within a year of the purchase, with another 30 locations added in early 1990.[35] While other \\"Wimpy\\" locations are still in operation presently, they are now independent from BK and no longer have the presence they once did.[5]\\r\\nThe 1990s led off with Grand Met taking Burger King's soft drink contract to Coca-Cola from Pepsi.[36] Traditionally Burger King had sold soft drinks from the Coca-Cola Company in the United States, but in 1983, PepsiCo was able to garner the US$444?million beverage supplier contract from its rival. Despite extreme market debate over the future of the contract, it was renewed for a second term in 1987.[37] A sweetened contract that strengthened marketing and advertising program ties between Burger King and itself allowed Pepsi to keep supplying soft drinks to BK. Leading up to the decision, Pepsi had sponsored over 100 separate cross-promotions and product tie-ins, including a Fourth of July promotion where BK gave away a free Pepsi with each purchase. This fit into the goals of BK, which was looking for a partner that would provide \\"outstanding, impactful promotional support.\\"[38][39] However, the contract only lasted three more years when, partially based upon Pepsi's growth as a restaurant operator with its Tricon Restaurants division, Burger King moved its beverage contract back to Coca-Cola.[40][41] Accompanying the reintroduction of Coca-Cola, BK introduced its first major chicken sandwich since 1977; the new BK Broiler sandwich was a broiled sandwich targeting more health-conscious customers. The BK Broiler was a rapid hit and within six months of its introduction was selling more than a million units daily system wide.[5]\\r\\nThe company made an advertising coup that same year when it signed a 10-picture contract with the Walt Disney Company.[5] The deal, which included such Disney films as The Lion King, Aladdin and Toy Story, came at the height of Disney's commercial rebirth. Accompanied with the new BK Kid's Club program, the company saw an impressive growth within the children's market. The company's new Kid's Club, its first major foray into a children's targeted ad campaign since the Burger King/Burger King Kingdom program of the 1970s, saw phenomenal growth with more than one million children signing up for the program within two months of its introduction.[5]\\r\\nWhile many of the moves made by Grand Met were successful in generating additional sales and growth, the company continued to experience problems. While Fortune Magazine named CEO Gibbons as its Turnaround Champion for his success in reversing the fortunes of the company,[42][43] several news outlets claimed that the changes he introduced were problematic because they deprived the company of valuable assets.\\r\\nIn 1992, Hurricane Andrew destroyed the company headquarters. The building, located on Old Cutler Rd. in Miami, was right in the center of the path of the hurricane. Located on the shoreline at the terminus of 184th St. (Eureka Drive), the highest storm surge levels was recorded (16.9?ft) at the site.[44] The building suffered more than $24?million (USD) in damage and pushed the company from its offices during one of its more significant product pushes.[45][46] Not only was the company forced from its facilities, roughly 300 members of its 700+ staff were left homeless.[45][46] Immediately after the storm, Gibbons began a program to help get the company back on track. The company's recovery was helped due to pre-planning before the storm's landfall; Corporate backoffice data was moved to Seattle, Washington before the storm struck in order to safeguard critical records,[47] and the company established a temporary \\"command center\\" at the Doral Resort and Country Club in Miami within eight days of the hurricanes passing.[46] Additional operations were temporarily decentralized by temporarily shifting some corporate functions to regional offices.[46] The facility would eventually take more than a year to rebuild, finally opening in September 1993.[48]\\r\\nNot only did Gibbons work to repair the damage to the company offices, he made it a priority to allow its staff to deal with their personal situations. He made staff members job descriptions more flexible, encouraging staff members to take the initiative to perform a wide range of tasks. A corporate day care system was established, allowing staff to bring their children to work. Staff members were allowed to take off as much time as needed to reestablish themselves and corporate dress codes were relaxed. The company brought in counselors, insurance experts, tax consultants, child care advisers and construction companies to help the staff reorient themselves. The company also went so far as to arrange emergency loans for its employees.[46] By 1993, Gibbons had tired of the post, and named a new successor to the post. He initially resigned his post as CEO of the company and was replaced by his chosen successor, COO James B. Adamson.[49][50] Gibbons retained his position as chairman until he left the company\\r\\nAdamson continued the company's plans to expand into new markets such as universities, gas stations, airports and sports arenas with the intention of looking into new channels of distribution.[49] Over the next year and a half he worked on a series of initiatives to strengthen the company; in a back to basics campaign, he oversaw a streamlining Burger King's menu and worked to improve and strengthen relations with franchisees. His changes were credited with a 28 percent increase in sales in BK's fiscal year 1995 and same store sales that were up 6 percent.[51] He left in early 1995 when Denny's made him an offer to take the reins of the competitor; he left the company credited with fixing the deficiencies left by Gibbons and was temporarily replaced with David Nash.[51][52] He was elevated to Chairman in July, with Robert Lowes as CEO. Lowes became chairman in November.[53]\\r\\nIn 1997, Grand Metropolitan merged with Guinness to form a company called Diageo in a deal worth US$22 billion.[54] Franchisees alleged that Diageo ignored the chain in favor of its liquor business; there were two more CEOs in the time Diageo owned the company.\\r\\nThis institutionalized neglect further hurt the standing of the brand, in turn causing significant financial damage to Burger King's franchisees.[55] By the time of the sale, Burger King's revenues and market share had declined significantly, and the company had fallen to a near tie for second place with rival Wendy's in the US market for hamburger chain restaurants.[56] For many years leading into the early 2000s, Burger King and its various owners plus many of its larger franchisees closed many under-performing stores.[57] Several of its largest franchisees entered bankruptcy due to the issues surrounding the performance of the brand.[58][59]\\r\\nDiageo maintained ownership of BK until 2000 when Diageo decided to focus solely on their beverage products and divest itself of the chain.[60] In 2001, the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. Burger King's franchises representation group, The National Franchise Association (NFA), sought to block this because it believed that any money raised from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands. Instead, the NFA sought to purchase the chain from Diageo, but the deal collapsed when the NFA was unable to put together an acceptable financing package.[61][62]\\r\\nIn 2002, a troika of private equity firms led by TPG Capital, L.P with associates Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners agreed to purchase BK from Diageo for $1.5?billion (USD),[5][63] with the sale becoming complete in December of that year.[64] The new owners, through several new CEOs, moved to revitalize and reorganize the company, the first major move was to rename the BK parent as Burger King Brands.[65] The investment group initially planned to take BK public within the two years of the acquisition, this was delayed until 2006. On 1 February 2006, Out-going CEO Greg Brenneman announced TPG's plans to turn Burger King into a publicly traded company by issuing an Initial Public Offering (IPO).\\r\\nOn February 16, the company announced it had filed its registration for the IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Burger King began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BKC on May 18, 2006. The stock sale generated $425?million in revenue, the largest IPO of a US-based restaurant chain on record. The proceeds from the sale were used by the company help pay back a loan taken out taken by the company in February used to pay dividends to the investment firms. According to one analyst at Renaissance Capital, Wall Street investors were not alarmed by the large payout due to the increased financial stability of the company resulting from changes made by the investor groups during the interim between the purchase in 2002 and the stock offering. Incoming CEO John W. Chidsey backed the payouts, stating that the financial firms spent considerable time and capital turning the company around.[66]\\r\\nBy the middle of its fiscal year 2008, the company had seen significant domestic growth for the first time in several years; for more than a dozen financial quarters, the company showed revenue increases and domestic expansion. During the first half of the calendar year 2008, the company initiated a plan to revitalize its stores with a program to replace or remodel almost all of its North American locations by the beginning of its fiscal year 2009 in July 2008.[67] The renovation plan was credited with helping the company increase same-store sales by as much as 5.4 percent over the previous fiscal year versus its competitors McDonald's and Yum Brand's 3 percent increase, but the total costs of the renovation program affected the company's revenue stream for the final quarters of its 2008 fiscal year. Wall Street analysts had originally projected net income to be approximately 27S per share, but the company only reported a 25S per share profit. The smaller profit announcement temporarily drove Burger King's stock prices down after the announcement. Despite the lower than expected profit and small decline in stock value, Wall Street analysts were upbeat about Burger King's future earnings because it was felt that the renovations would contribute to future profits; one such analyst stated that the renovations would \\"pay for themselves\\".[68]\\r\\nFurther modernization plans were introduced in 2009 with the company's \\"20/20\\" store designs and its \\"BK Whopper Bar\\" concept. The 20/20 concept, officially unveiled in Amsterdam on 10 October, featured a radical new design that featured bright colors, corrugated metal accents and plain brick walls that are designed to compete with chains in the fast casual restaurant market segment. A new system of in-store advertising was also introduced as part of the new format, static menu boards are to be replaced with high definition video displays. With the introduction of the 20/20 format, all future Burger King locations will be constructed using the design framework. Additionally, any future restaurant renovations must also conform to the new standard. The primary drawback of the design is its costs to the individual owners of BK restaurants; franchises must pay between $300,000ÿ$600,000 (USD) to renovate their buildings to Burger King specs.[69]\\r\\nThe Whopper Bar is a concept from the company that upends its traditional fast food operations with a newer high end concept designed to compete with fast casual and casual dining restaurants. The new format is described by the company as a more \\"playful\\" variation on the standard Burger King location. The locations feature an open kitchen with a semi-circular metal counter top designed to allow customers to watch as its \\"Whopperistas\\" put together the order.[70] The exposed kitchen concept allows customers to view the preparation of their foods. Decoration of the new locations is limited to plasma televisions playing looped videos of open flames. The concept is similar to the McCafe concept from rival McDonald's, and like the McCafe locations they are designed to go into malls, airports and casinos and other areas with limited amounts of space.[71]\\r\\nWith the opening of its Whopper Bar locations in the United States during 2010, Burger King reported that it would be the first time in its North American locations that beer would be available for purchase. Although beer is available at fast food restaurants throughout Europe, including Burger King, this is the first time a major fast food chain has attempted to sell beer in the United States. The company will be selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch including Budweiser, Bud Lite and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because of the company is known as a fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is a practical one because the company is growing with its aging customer base.[72][73][74]\\r\\nThe latest chapter in the company's ownership history began in September 2010 when TPG and its partners announced it would sell their 31 percent stake in Burger King to another private equity company, 3G Capital, for $24 per share, or $3.26?billion (USD).[75][76] Between March 2004 and March 2009, the company experienced a score of consecutive profitable quarters that were credited with re-energizing the company, however with the slowing of the economy during the financial crisis of 2007-2010 the company's business has declined while its immediate competitor McDonald's grew.[77] Analysts, including John Glass of Morgan Stanley and David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird & Co., part of the reasons for the company's slowed performance is its continue reliance on the super fan.[77] Market-research firm Sandelman & Associates reported that this segment had seen a decline in visits by this demographic group by more than 50 percent during the recession, while restaurant industry analyst Bonnie Riggs at market-research firm NPD Group reported the 18ÿ24 transferred much of its business from the fast food segment to the fast casual segment, compounding the decline.[77]\\r\\nThe offer, representing a 46 percent premium over the stocks selling price at the time, came as a surprise to Burger King CEO John Chidsey. The proposed sale was expected to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald's.[78] Analysts commenting on the transaction stated that 3G will have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. David Palmer from UBS stated the company will need to work with its large group of franchise owners to brighten its locations and stabilize sales which could take several years and require significant reinvestment,[76] while Steve West of Stifel Nicolaus stated that Burger King will need at least a year to right its fundamentals.[78]\\r\\nUpon completion of the acquisition in October 2010, 3G began an immediate restructuring of the company. Seven of the top executives were released, while another 261 employees were laid off from the company's headquarters.[79] Chidsey eventually resigned in April 2011, being replaced Alex Behring, one of 3G's managing partners. The position of CEO was taken over by Bernardo Hees shortly after the acquisition.[80]\\r\\nAs part of the restructuring, 3G also moved to change many aspects of corporate operations throughout 2011-2012. One of the first moves was to terminate Burger King's relationship with ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky, replacing it with McGarryBowen. 3G also began a menu restructuring, with the first product being a revamped version of BK's Chicken Tenders product. Other new or reformulated products would follow. In terms of its franchise operations, Burger King initiated a move to become more like competitors Subway and KFC and began to sell off the majority of corporately owned restaurants in order to become an exclusive franchised operation. 3G also moved to mend relations with its American franchises, which had become rather rancorous during TPG's tenure. Several lawsuits were settled and corporate policies that were at the center of the corporate disputes with the franchises were ended or amended.\\r\\nIn 2011 they partnered with British venture capital firm Justice Holdings to take the company public again.[81] They also initiated a massive expansion of operations via franchising in the BRIC nations and Africa with more than 2500 new planned locations.[82][83][84][85]\\r\\nIn August 2014, Burger King announced its intent to acquire the Canadian restaurant and coffee shop chain Tim Hortons. 3G Capital purchased Tim Hortons at $65.50 per-share, and a new holding company was formed, based in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. 3G holds a 51% majority stake, Tim Hortons' existing shareholders owning 22%, and a 27% stake held by Burger King shareholders. Berkshire Hathaway partially funded the purchase by buying $3 billion worth of preferred shares. Burger King CEO Daniel Schwartz became CEO of the company, with existing Tim Hortons CEO Marc Caira becoming vice-chairman and director. The two chains retained separate operations post-merger, with Burger King remaining in its Miami headquarters. The deal was subject to approval by Tim Hortons shareholders and Canadian regulatory authorities.[86] A Tim Hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow Tim Hortons to leverage Burger King's resources for international growth. The combined company became the third-largest international chain of fast food restaurants.[87][88] From 1995 to 2005, Tim Hortons had been owned by Wendy's Restaurants, a competitor to Burger King.\\r\\nAlthough \\"tax inversions\\" (in which a company decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a country with lower rates, but maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location) have been a recent financial trend, it will not have as much of an impact on Burger King's reincorporation in Canada: the corporate tax rate in the United States is 39.1%, Canada's corporate tax rate is only 26%, but Burger King had used various sheltering techniques to reduce its tax rate to 27.5%. As a high-profile instance of tax inversion, news of the merger was criticized by U.S. politicians, who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests, and could result in further government pressure against inversions (which had, until the Burger King merger, been primarily invoked by pharmaceutical firms).[88][89][90][91]\\r\\nSome key dates include:\\r\\nSince being founded in 1954, Burger King has undergone five changes of ownership. Further, during the ownership tenure of Grand Metropolitan, Grand Met merged with Guinness in 1997 to form a new company, Diageo.[101] TPG Capital's ownership was shared with Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, both of which held minority shares.[102] During 3G Capital's ownership, 3G divested a 29% stake of the chain to Justice Holdings of Great Britain when the chain was again taken public in 2012.[102][103] When Burger King merged with Tim Hortons in 2014, Berkshire Hathaway bought into the newly combined chain as part of an debt-equity financing deal.[104]\\r\\nSince its founding, Burger King has had more than twenty CEOs.[105]","input":"Where was the first burger king restaurant located?"},{"output":"the cohabitation story between a frustrated young woman and a framed young man","context":"How Long Will I Love U (Chinese: ]CZи) is a 2018 Chinese fantasy romantic comedy film written and directed by Su Lun and produced by Xu Zheng.

Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: primary active transport that uses ATP, and secondary active transport that uses an electrochemical gradient. An example of active transport in human physiology is the uptake of glucose in the intestines.\\r\\n\\r\\nActive transport is the movement of molecules across a membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentrationagainst the concentration gradient or other obstructing factor.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike passive transport, which uses the kinetic energy and natural entropy of molecules moving down a gradient, active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient, polar repulsion, or other resistance. Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs, such as ions, glucose and amino acids. If the process uses chemical energy, such as from adenosine triphosphate (ATP), it is termed primary active transport. Secondary active transport involves the use of an electrochemical gradient. Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1848, the German physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond suggested the possibility of active transport of substances across membranes.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nRosenberg (1948) formulated the concept of active transport based on energetic considerations,[3] but later it would be redefined.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, Jens Christian Skou, a Danish physician [4] received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research regarding the sodium-potassium pump [4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne category of cotransporters that is especially prominent in research regarding diabetes treatment [5] is sodium glucose cotransporters. These transporters were discovered by scientists at that National Health Institute.[6] These scientists had noticed a discrepancy in the absorption of glucose at different points in the kidney tubule of a rat. The gene was then discovered for intestinal glucose transport protein and linked to these membrane sodium glucose cotransport systems. The first of these membrane transport proteins was named SGLT1 followed by the discovery of SGLT2.[6] Robert Krane also played a prominent role in this field.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecialized transmembrane proteins recognize the substance and allow it to move across the membrane when it otherwise would not, either because the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane is impermeable to the substance moved or because the substance is moved against the direction of its concentration gradient.[7] There are two forms of active transport, primary active transport and secondary active transport. In primary active transport, the proteins involved are pumps that normally use the chemical energy in the form of ATP. Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an electrochemical gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.[8] This involves pore-forming proteins that form channels across the cell membrane. The difference between passive transport and active transport is that the active transport requires energy, and moves substances against their respective concentration gradient, whereas passive transport requires no energy and moves substances in the direction of their respective concentration gradient.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an antiporter, one substrate is transported in one direction across the membrane while another is cotransported in the opposite direction.  In a symporter, two substrates are transported in the same direction across the membrane. Antiport and symport processes are associated with secondary active transport, meaning that one of the two substances is transported against its concentration gradient, utilizing the energy derived from the transport of another ion (mostly Na+, K+ or H+ ions) down its concentration gradient.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf substrate molecules are moving from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration[10] (i.e., in the opposite direction as, or against the concentration gradient), specific transmembrane carrier proteins are required. These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., glucose) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the small intestine.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute solution. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the concentration gradient. For example, the molecules chlorine (Cl^-) and nitrate NO3- exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.[12] Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. These charged particles require ion pumps or ion channels to cross membranes and distribute through the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the enzymes that perform this type of transport are transmembrane ATPases. A primary ATPase universal to all animal life is the sodium-potassium pump, which helps to maintain the cell potential. The sodium-potassium pump maintains the membrane potential by moving three Na+  ions out of the cell for every two [13] K+ ions moved into the cell. Other sources of energy for Primary active transport are redox energy and photon energy (light).  An example of primary active transport using Redox energy is the mitochondrial electron transport chain that uses the reduction energy of NADH to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient.  An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in photosynthesis that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane and also to create reduction power in the form of NADPH.\\r\\n\\r\\nATP hydrolysis is used to transport hydrogen ions against the electrochemical gradient (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration). Phosphorylation of the carrier protein and the binding of a hydrogen ion induce a conformational (shape) change that drives the hydrogen ions to transport against the electrochemical gradient. Hydrolysis of the bound phosphate group and release of hydrogen ion then restores the carrier to its original conformation.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdenosine Triphosphate-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) comprise a large and diverse protein family, often functioning as ATP-driven pumps.  Usually, there are several domains involved in the overall transporter protein's structure, including two nucleotide-binding domains that constitute the ATP-binding motif and two hydrophobic transmembrane domains that create the \\"pore\\" component.  In broad terms, ABC transporters are involved in the import or export of molecules across a cell membrane; yet within the protein family there is an extensive range of function.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn plants, ABC transporters are often found within cell and organelle membranes, such as the mitochondria, chloroplast, and plasma membrane.  There is evidence to support that plant ABC transporters play a direct role in pathogen response, phytohormone transport, and detoxification.[15]  Furthermore, certain plant ABC transporters may function in actively exporting volatile compounds[16] and antimicrobial metabolites.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn petunia flowers (Petunia hybrida), the ABC transporter PhABCG1 is involved in the active transport of volatile organic compounds.  PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection.  To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased PhABCG1 expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed.  Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds.  Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed PhABCG1 to test for transport activity involving different substrates.    Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites.  Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites.  One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1.  This unique ABC transporter is found in Nicotiana tabacum BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors.  NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization.  Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn secondary active transport, also known as coupled transport or cotransport, energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to primary active transport, there is no direct coupling of ATP; instead it relies upon the electrochemical potential difference created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.[18] Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases entropy and can serve as a source of energy for metabolism (e.g. in ATP synthase). The energy derived from the pumping of protons across a cell membrane is frequently used as the energy source in secondary active transport. In humans, sodium (Na+) is a commonly co-transported ion across the plasma membrane, whose electrochemical gradient is then used to power the active transport of a second ion or molecule against its gradient.[19] In bacteria and small yeast cells, a commonly cotransported ion is hydrogen.[19] Hydrogen pumps are also used to create an electrochemical gradient to carry out processes within cells such as in the electron transport chain, an important function of cellular respiration that happens in the mitochondrion of the cell.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1960, in Prague, Robert K. Crane presented for the first time his discovery of the sodium-glucose cotransport as the mechanism for intestinal glucose absorption.[21] Crane's discovery of cotransport was the first ever proposal of flux coupling in biology.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotransporters can be classified as symporters and antiporters depending on whether the substances move in the same or opposite directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an antiporter two species of ion or other solutes are pumped in opposite directions across a membrane. One of these species is allowed to flow from high to low concentration which yields the entropic energy to drive the transport of the other solute from a low concentration region to a high one.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example is the sodium-calcium exchanger or antiporter, which allows three sodium ions into the cell to transport one calcium out.[24] This antiporter mechanism is important within the membranes of cardiac muscle cells in order to keep the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm low.[8] Many cells also possess calcium ATPases, which can operate at lower intracellular concentrations of calcium and sets the normal or resting concentration of this important second messenger.[25] But the ATPase exports calcium ions more slowly: only 30 per second versus 2000 per second by the exchanger. The exchanger comes into service when the calcium concentration rises steeply or \\"spikes\\" and enables rapid recovery.[26] This shows that a single type of ion can be transported by several enzymes, which need not be active all the time (constitutively), but may exist to meet specific, intermittent needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA symporter uses the downhill movement of one solute species from high to low concentration to move another molecule uphill from low concentration to high concentration (against its concentration gradient). Both molecules are transported in the same direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example is the glucose symporter SGLT1, which co-transports one glucose (or galactose) molecule into the cell for every two sodium ions it imports into the cell.[27] This symporter is located in the small intestines,[28] heart,[29] and brain.[30] It is also located in the S3 segment of the proximal tubule in each nephron in the kidneys.[31]  Its mechanism is exploited in glucose rehydration therapy[32] This mechanism uses the absorption of sugar through the walls of the intestine to pull water in along with it.[33] Defects in SGLT2 prevent effective reabsorption of glucose, causing familial renal glucosuria.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nEndocytosis and exocytosis are both forms of bulk transport that move materials into and out of cells, respectively, via vesicles.[35] In the case of endocytosis, the cellular membrane folds around the desired materials outside the cell.[36] The ingested particle becomes trapped within a pouch, known as a vesicle, inside the cytoplasm. Often enzymes from lysosomes are then used to digest the molecules absorbed by this process. Substances that enter the cell via signal mediated endocytosis include proteins, hormones and growth factors.[37] Viruses enter cells through a form of endocytosis that involves their outer membrane fusing with the membrane of the cell. This forces the viral DNA into the host cell.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nBiologists distinguish two main types of endocytosis: pinocytosis and phagocytosis.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nExocytosis involves the removal of substances through the fusion of the outer cell membrane and a vesicle membrane[38] An example of exocytosis would be the transmission of neurotransmitters across a synapse between brain cells.","input":"When is active transport used in the body?"},{"output":"October 2012","context":"The MacBook Pro (sometimes abbreviated MBP)[1] is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc. Replacing the PowerBook G4, the MacBook Pro was the second model to be announced during the AppleÿIntel transition, after the iMac. It is the high-end model of the MacBook family and is currently available in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. A 17-inch version was available between April 2006 and June 2012.\\r\\nThe first generation MacBook Pro appeared externally similar to the PowerBook G4, but used Intel Core processors instead of PowerPC G4 chips. The 15-inch model was introduced first, in January 2006; the 17-inch model followed in April. Both received several updates and Core 2 Duo processors later that year.\\r\\nThe product's second iteration, known as the \\"unibody\\" model, has a casing made from a single piece of aluminum. It debuted in October 2008 in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. In January 2009, the 17-inch model was updated with the same unibody design. Subsequent updates brought upgraded Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and introduced Intel's Thunderbolt technology.\\r\\nApple released the third generation of MacBook Pro with a 15-inch screen during WWDC 2012 and discontinued the 17-inch variant. The previous generation 13- and 15-inch unibody models continued to sell with updated processors. The third generation model was a quarter thinner than its predecessor and introduced the Retina Display with a much higher screen resolution. A 13-inch variant was released in October 2012.\\r\\nThe fourth generation MacBook Pro was announced on October 27, 2016. It replaced the function keys with an interactive, multi-touch \\"Touch Bar\\" and a Touch ID sensor integrated into the Power button. The 15-inch notebook started at $2,399, compared to $1,999 for the previous iteration.[2] On 5 June 2017, Apple upgraded the internals of the MacBook Pro, such as enhanced Iris Plus and AMD Radeon graphics, Kaby Lake processors, and added memory. Additionally, the 13-inch MacBook Pro now comes with a 128GB storage option (down from the base 256GB storage) with a lowered starting price of $1299. All other configurations of the MacBook Pro have the same price as last year, barring the incremental upgrades in processors and graphics.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006 by Steve Jobs at the Macworld Conference & Expo.[4] The 17-inch model was unveiled on April 24, 2006.[5] The first design was largely a carryover from the PowerBook G4, but uses Intel Core CPUs instead of PowerPC G4 chips.[6] The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs the same as the 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, but is 0.1 inches (0.25?cm) deeper, 0.4 inches (1.0?cm) wider, and 0.1 inches (0.25?cm) thinner.[7] Other changes from the PowerBook include a built-in iSight webcam and the inclusion of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when yanked. These features were later brought over to the MacBook. The optical drive was reduced in size in order to fit into the slimmer MacBook Pro, hence it runs slower than the optical drive in the PowerBook G4 and cannot write to dual layer DVDs.[6][8]\\r\\nBoth the original 15- and 17-inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots found in the PowerBook G4. All first generation 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port,[9] while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports as well as one FireWire 400 port.[10] When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S-Video ports,[7][9] although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision[11] and is present in every version of the 17-inch design.[10] S-Video capability can be attained through the use of a DVI to S-Video adapter.[7] External displays with up to a 2,560?G?1,600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual-link DVI port.[12] All models include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g.[9][10] Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n[13] and Bluetooth 2.1.\\r\\nApple refreshed the entire MacBook Pro line on October 24, 2006 to include Intel Core 2 Duo processors.[11] Memory capacity was doubled for each model, to 1?GB on the low-end 15-inch and 2?GB for the high-end 15- and 17-inch models.[11] FireWire 800 was added to the 15-inch models. Hard drive capacity was increased, although video card options stayed the same.[11] The MacBook Pro line received a second update on June 5, 2007 with new Nvidia Geforce 8600M GT video cards and faster processor options.[14][15] LED backlighting was added to the 15-inch model's screen, and its weight was reduced from 5.6 pounds (2.5?kg) to 5.4 pounds (2.4?kg).[15] Furthermore, the speed of the front-side bus was increased from 667?MHz to 800?MHz. On November 1, 2007, Apple added the option of a 2.6?GHz Santa Rosa platform Core 2 Duo CPU as well as reconfigured hard drive options.[15]\\r\\nOn February 26, 2008, the MacBook Pro line was again updated.[16][17] LED backlighting was added as an option for the 17-inch model.[16] Processors were updated to \\"Penryn\\" cores, which are built on the 45 nanometer process (65 nanometer \\"Merom\\" cores were previously used), and hard drive and memory capacities were increased.[16] Multi-touch capabilities, first introduced with the MacBook Air earlier that year, were brought over to the MacBook Pro's trackpad.[16] When the 15-inch unibody MacBook Pro was introduced on October 14, 2008, the pre-unibody model with the same screen size was discontinued, while the 17-inch pre-unibody model continued to be sold.[18] The original case design was discontinued on January 6, 2009, when the 17-inch MacBook Pro was also updated with unibody construction.[19]\\r\\nSome reviewers applauded the MacBook Pro for its doubling or tripling the speed of the PowerBook G4 in some areas.[6] For example, the 3D rendering program Cinema 4D XL was 3.3?times as fast (2.3 times faster),[6] and its boot-up time was more than twice as quick.[7] The MacBook Pro generally outperformed the PowerBook G4 in performance analyzer utility tests XBench and Cinebench.[7] Reviewers lauded the screen's maximum brightness, 67?percent higher than the PowerBook G4; the excellent horizontal viewing angles; the matte options; and the bright, crisp, and true colors.[8] Although the screen offered fewer vertical pixels (1,440?G?900 in the MacBook Pro instead of 1,440?G?960 in the PowerBook), one reviewer called the screen \\"nothing less than stellar\\".[7] Reviewers praised the new MagSafe power adapter,[6] although one reviewer said it disconnected too easily in some instances.[7] They also praised the backlit keyboard, large trackpad, and the virtually silent operation of the machine.[6][8] The new laptop also offered better wireless performance.\\r\\nOne reviewer criticized the decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30?percent its original speed.[8] The notebook was also noted for running hot.[6][8] Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks.[7] Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models.[7] Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings.[7] Apple increased the battery capacity by 10?Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60,[7] but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power.[7] Battery life therefore remained about the same as in previous models, at three-plus hours.[7]\\r\\nSuperDrive: 8G DVD-DL discs reads. 4G DVD+/-R & RW recording. 24G CD-R and 10G CD-RW recording\\r\\n(optional for 15-inch)\\r\\nSuperDrive: 4G DVD+R writes, 8G DVD+/-R read, 4G DVD+/-RW writes, 24G CD-R, and 10G CD-RW recording (17-inch)\\r\\nOn October 14, 2008, in a press event at company headquarters, Apple officials announced a new 15-inch MacBook Pro featuring a \\"precision aluminum unibody enclosure\\" and tapered sides similar to those of the MacBook Air.[30][31] Designers shifted the MacBook Pro's ports to the left side of the case, and moved the optical disc drive slot from the front to the right side, similar to the MacBook. The new MacBook Pros had two video cards, which the user could switch between: the Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT with either 256 or 512?MB of dedicated memory and a GeForce 9400M with 256?MB of shared system memory.[30] Although the FireWire 400 port was removed, the FireWire 800 port was retained. The DVI port was replaced with a Mini DisplayPort receptacle.[30] The original unibody MacBook Pro came with a user-removable battery; Apple claimed five hours of use,[30] with one reviewer reporting results closer to four on a continuous video battery stress test.[32] Apple said that the battery would hold 80?percent of its charge after 300 recharges.[33]\\r\\nThe unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely follows the styling of the original aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display.[30] The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option is available in the 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed.[34] The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button.[34] The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures.[34] When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad.[35][36][37] The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.[35]\\r\\nDuring the MacWorld Expo keynote on January 6, 2009, Phil Schiller announced a 17-inch MacBook Pro with unibody construction. This version diverged from its 15-inch sibling with an anti-glare \\"matte\\" screen option (with the glossy finish standard) and a non user-removable lithium polymer battery.[38] Instead of traditional round cells inside the casing, the lithium-ion polymer batteries are shaped and fitted into each laptop to maximally utilize space. Adaptive charging, which uses a chip to optimize the charge flow to reduce wear and tear, extends the battery's overall life.[38] Battery life for the 17\\" version is quoted at eight hours, with 80?percent of this charge remaining after 1,000 charge-discharge cycles.[38]\\r\\nAt Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 8, 2009, it was announced that the 13-inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re-branded as a MacBook Pro,[39] leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line.[40] It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user-removable battery first introduced in the 17-inch MacBook Pro.[41] The updated MacBook Pro 13- and the 15-inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life, while the 17-inch would keep its eight-hour capacity.[39][41] Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros during casual use,[42] while others reported around six hours.[34] Like the 17-inch MacBook Pro, Apple claims that they will last around 1,000 charge cycles while still containing 80?percent of their capacity.[43] Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release, although the 13-inch[44] and the base model 15-inch, came with only the GeForce 9400M GPU.[45] The screens were also improved, gaining a claimed 60?percent greater color gamut.[44][45] All of these mid 2009 models also included a FireWire 800 port and all except the 17-inch models would receive an SD card slot.[31] The 17-inch model would retain its ExpressCard/34 slot.[41] For the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Kensington lock slot was moved to the right side of the chassis.[46] In August 2009, Apple extended the \\"matte\\" anti-glare display option to the 15-inch MacBook Pro.[47]\\r\\nOn April 13, 2010,[48] Intel Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs were introduced in the 15- and 17-inch models, while the 13-inch retained the Core 2 Duo with a speed increase.[48] The power brick was redesigned[35] and a high-resolution display (of 1,680?G?1,050) was announced as an option for the 15-inch models.[36] The 13-inch gained an integrated Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics processing unit (GPU) with 256?MB of shared memory, while the 15- and 17-inch models were upgraded to the GeForce GT 330M, with either 256 or 512?MB of dedicated memory.[48] The 15- and 17-inch models also have an integrated Intel GPU that is built into the Core i5 and i7 processors.[48] The 15-inch model also gained 0.1 pounds (0.045?kg).[36] Save for a third USB 2.0 slot, all the ports on the 17-inch MacBook Pro are the same in type and number as on the 15-inch version.[49] All models come with 4?GB of system memory that is upgradeable to 8?GB.[48] Battery life was also extended further in this update, to an estimated ten hours for the 13-inch and 8ÿ9 hours on the 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros.[48] This was achieved through both greater power efficiency and adding more battery capacity.[48] One reviewer reported about six hours of battery life through a continuous video battery stress test in the 15-inch[37] and another, who called the battery life \\"unbeatable\\", reported nearer to eight in the 13-inch through their \\"highly demanding battery drain test\\".[35]\\r\\nThunderbolt technology, Sandy Bridge dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 (on the 13-inch model) or quad-core i7 (on the 15- and 17-inch models) processors, and a high definition FaceTime camera were added on February 24, 2011. Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M graphics cards. Later editions of these models, following the release of OS X Lion, replaced the dashboard (F4) key with a launchpad key. The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models.[50] The Thunderbolt serial bus platform can achieve speeds of up to 10?Gbit/s,[51] which is up to twice as fast as the USB 3.0 specification, 20 times faster than the USB 2.0 specification, and up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800.[52] Apple says that Thunderbolt can be used to drive displays or to transfer large quantities of data in a short amount of time.[52]\\r\\nOn June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its upgraded Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco.[53] The new MacBook Pro models were updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB.[54] Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a media event on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros except for the entry-level 2.5?GHz 13-inch model.[55] Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016. Prior to its discontinuation it was Apples only product to still include an optical drive and a Firewire port, and only laptop with a hard disk drive and Ethernet port.[56]\\r\\nSome reviewers praised the new laptop's performance and compact size,[32] the quality of the screen, and sturdy unibody build,[32] which allowed easier upgrading of internal components as compared to the original models.[32] Some reviewers also noted that the new MacBook Pro ran more quietly and at cooler temperatures than first generation machines.[32] Others, however, criticized the amount of heat generated by the new design.[57][58]\\r\\nReviewers lamented the loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight, even when its brightness was turned all the way up.[32] CNET's Dan Ackerman commented of the mid-2009 models: \\"According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions.\\"[34] By 2011, matte screens were offered for both the 15\\" and 17\\" models. Furthermore, the addition of Mini DisplayPort instead of the more popular HDMI was criticized.[32] The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also bemoaned.[32]\\r\\nLaptop Magazine's Michael Prospero praised the 2010 15-inch model's display, calling it \\"bright and crisp\\". He further commented, \\"While reflections from the glossy display weren't overwhelming, it's also nice to know there's an antiglare optionthough only for the higher resolution display. Still, colors were bright, blacks were deep and dark, and viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally.\\" He also lauded the quality of the iSight webcam, the responsiveness of the touchpad, the microphone and speakers, as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15\\" model and the long battery life. Complaints included the price of the laptop, the low number of USB ports, and the lack of HDMI.[36]\\r\\nCNET praised the automatic graphics switching features of the 15- and 17-inch 2010 models as well as the graphics cards themselves. Acclaim was also given to the Core i5 and i7 CPUs, the multi-touch trackpad, and the addition of audio capabilities to the Mini DisplayPort video output.[37] They also called for the addition of HDMI and the Blu-ray optical disc format, saying that most other computers in the MacBook Pro's price range possessed these features.[37] CNET also criticized the option of a higher resolution screen in the 15-inch model, saying that \\"the higher-resolution screen should be included by default.\\"[37]\\r\\n2.53?GHz (T9400) Intel Core 2 Duo Penryn with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (T9600) with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache\\r\\n2.8?GHz (T9600) (15\\" and 17\\" only) Intel Core 2 Duo Penryn with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.06?GHz (T9900) with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache (15\\" and 17\\" only)\\r\\nSince the RAM and the hard drive on some generations of MacBook Pro are user serviceable parts, there are aftermarket modifications to enhance the system with up to 16GB of DDR3-1600 RAM (maximum capacity and frequency depend on the hardware in question), 7200-rpm hard drives or third party SSDs.\\r\\nEarly and Late 2011 models reportedly suffer from manufacturing problems leading to overheating, graphical issues, and eventually complete GPU and logic board failure. A thread was opened on the Apple Support community[89] that reached more than 12,000 posts and 4,000,000 visits (Feb 2015). A similar but nonidentical issue affected iMac GPUs which were later recalled by Apple.[90] The problem was covered by many articles in Mac-focused magazines, starting late 2013 throughout 2014.[91][92][93][94][95] In August 2014 the law firm Whitfield Bryson & Mason LLP had begun investigating the problem to determine if any legal claim exists.[96] On October 28, 2014, the firm announced that it has filed a class-action lawsuit in a California federal court against Apple. The lawsuit will cover residents residing in both California and Florida who have purchased a 2011 MacBook Pro notebook with an AMD graphics card. The firm is also investigating similar cases across the United States.[97] On February 20, 2015, Apple instituted the \\"MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues\\".? This \\"will repair affected MacBook Pro systems, free of charge\\".\\r\\nOn June 11, 2012 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, Apple introduced the third generation MacBook Pro, marketed as the \\"MacBook Pro with Retina display\\" to differentiate it from the predecessor model.[53] The new model includes Intel's third generation Core i7 processors (Ivy Bridge microarchitecture), USB 3.0, and a high-resolution 15.4\\" IPS 2880G1800-pixel Retina Display.[54] Other new or changed features include a second Thunderbolt port, a HDMI port, and a thinner MagSafe port, dubbed the \\"MagSafe 2\\".[98] Apple introduced a 13-inch version on October 23, 2012 with specifications similar but slightly inferior to the 15-inch version's, such as less powerful processors.[99]\\r\\nThe new models omit Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports, though Apple offers Thunderbolt adapters for both interfaces.[100] They also omit a SuperDrive, making the 15-inch model Apple's first professional notebook since the PowerBook 2400c to ship without a built-in optical drive.[101] Instead of a hard disk drive, the new models ship with a solid state drive housed in a proprietary flash module design rather than a 2.5\\" notebook drive. Apple also claims improved speakers and microphones and a new system for cooling the notebook with improved fans.[98] The new case design does not have a Kensington lock slot, so alternative products are required to physically secure the computer.[102]\\r\\nThe Retina models also have fewer user-accessible upgrade or replacement options than previous MacBooks. Unlike in previous generations, the memory is soldered onto the logic board and is therefore not upgradable. The solid state drive is not soldered and can be replaced by users.[103] The battery is glued into place; attempts to remove it may destroy the battery and/or trackpad.[104] The entire case uses proprietary pentalobe screws and cannot be disassembled with standard tools. While the battery is glued in, recycling companies have stated that the design is only \\"mildly inconvenient\\" and does not hamper the recycling process.[105]\\r\\nOn February 13, 2013, Apple announced updated prices and processors for the MacBook Pro with Retina Display and increased the RAM of the high-end 15-inch model to 16 GB.[106]\\r\\nOn October 22, 2013, Apple updated the line with Intel's Haswell processors and Iris Graphics, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Thunderbolt 2, and PCIe-based flash storage.[107] The chassis of the 13-inch version was slightly slimmed to 0.71 inches (18?mm) to match the 15-inch model. The lower-end 15-inch model only included integrated graphics while the higher-end model continued to include a discrete Nvidia graphics card in addition to integrated graphics.[108] Support for 4K video output via HDMI was added but limited the maximum number of external displays from three to two.[109] On July 29, 2014 Apple announced updated prices and processors for the Haswell MacBook Pro with Retina Display.[110]\\r\\nOn March 9, 2015, the 13-inch model was updated with Intel Broadwell processors, Iris 6100 graphics, faster flash storage, increased battery life, and a Force Touch trackpad.[111][112] On May 19, 2015, the 15-inch model was also updated with similarly fast flash storage, increased battery life, the Force Touch trackpad, and an AMD Radeon R9 discrete graphics card on the higher-end model.[113][114] The higher-end 15-inch model also added support for dual-cable output to 5120G2880 displays.[115] The 15-inch models were released with the same Intel Haswell processors and Iris Pro graphics as the 2014 models due to a delay in shipment of newer Broadwell quad-core processors.[116]\\r\\nThe Retina Display MacBook Pro largely follows the design of the previous generation with its aluminum enclosure and separated black keys. The most apparent body changes are a thinner chassis and a display with a redesigned hinge and thinner bezel and the removal of the internal optical drive. The power button is moved from the upper right corner of the chassis onto the keyboard, taking the place of the optical disc eject button.[117] At 0.71 inches (18?mm) thick, the 15-inch model is 25?percent thinner than its predecessor. The model name is no longer placed at the bottom of the screen bezel; instead, it is found on the underside of the chassis, similar to an iOS device. It is the first Macintosh laptop to not have its model name visible during normal use, as every prior laptop had its model name on the screen bezel or keyboard.[118]\\r\\nThe third generation MacBook Pro received positive reviews of the Retina Display, flash storage and power. It was criticized, however, for its high price and lack of an Ethernet port and optical drive. Roman Loyola of Macworld said that the Retina MacBook Pro was \\"groundbreaking\\" and made people \\"rethink how they use technology\\". He praised the inclusion of USB 3.0 and the slimmer body.[119] Dan Ackerman of CNET commented \\"I've previously called the 15-inch MacBook Pro one of the most universally useful all-around laptops you can buy. This new version adds to that with HDMI, faster ports, and more portability. But it also subtracts from that with its exclusion of an optical drive and Ethernet port, plus its very high starting price. The Pro and Retina Pro are clearly two laptops designed for two different users, and with the exception of all-day commuters who need something closer to a MacBook Air or ultrabook, one of the two branches of the MacBook Pro family tree is still probably the most universally useful laptop you can buy.\\"[120]\\r\\nJoel Santo Domingo of PC Magazine gave the MacBook Pro an \\"Editor's Choice\\" rating. He praised its \\"brilliant Retina display\\", the thin design, port selection and speedy storage, and highlighted the expandability via Thunderbolt ports which support up to seven devices each.[121] David Pogue of The New York Times praised the 15-inch model's screen, keyboard, sound, start-up time, cosmetics, battery life, storage, and RAM capacity. They criticized the lack of a SuperDrive, pricing, and the MagSafe 2 power connector's lack of backwards compatibility with the older MagSafe design.[122]\\r\\nSince the battery is glued in and cannot be easily disassembled for recycling (an EPEAT requirement), Apple received criticisms about the machine's ability to be recycled. Greenpeace spokesman Casey Harrell said Apple \\"has pitted design against the environmentand chosen design. They're making a big bet that people don't care, but recycling is a big issue.\\"[123] Wired also criticized Apple's recyclability claims, stating \\"[t]he design may well be comprised of 'highly recyclable aluminum and glass'but my friends in the electronics recycling industry tell me they have no way of recycling aluminum that has glass glued to it like Apple did with both this machine and the recent iPad.\\"[124]\\r\\nThe Retina Display on the MacBook Pro have been criticized for \\"image retention\\", specifically for displays manufactured by LG.[125][126]\\r\\nOptional 2.6?GHz (i7-3720QM) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.7?GHz (i7-3820QM) with 8?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.9?GHz (i7-3520M) dual-core Intel Core i7 Ivy Bridge processor with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.0?GHz (i7-3540M) dual-core Intel Core i7 Ivy Bridge with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.6?GHz (i5-4288U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Haswell with 3?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-4558U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Haswell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i5-4308U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Haswell with 3?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.0?GHz (i7-4578U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Haswell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.9?GHz (i5-5287U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Broadwell with 3?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.1?GHz (i7-5557U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Broadwell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.5?GHz (i7-4870HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-4980HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.7?GHz (i7-3740QM) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-3840QM) with 8?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.3?GHz (i7-4850HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.6?GHz (i7-4960HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.5?GHz (i7-4870HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-4980HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nApple unveiled fourth generation 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models during a press event at their headquarters on October 27, 2016. The models introduced the Touch Bar, a multi-touch enabled OLED strip built into the top of the keyboard in place of the function keys. They include a sapphire-glass covered Touch ID sensor at the right end of the Touch Bar which doubles as a power button. The models also introduce a \\"second-generation\\" butterfly mechanism keyboard that provided more travel than the first iteration implemented on the Retina MacBook. The 13-inch model has a trackpad that is 46% larger than its predecessor while the 15-inch model has a trackpad twice as large as the prior generation.\\r\\nAll ports have been replaced with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals,[138] any of which can be used for charging.[139] The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals,[140][141] including Intel's own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices.[142] Furthermore, MacOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them.[143] Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro.[139][144][145] The models come with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.\\r\\nOther updates to the MacBook Pro include dual and quad-core Intel \\"Skylake\\" Core i5 and i7 processors, improved graphics, and displays that offer a 25% wider color gamut, 67% more brightness, and 67% more contrast. All versions are able to output to a 5K display, with the 15-inch models capable of two. The 15-inch models include a discrete Radeon Pro 450, 455 or 460 graphics card in addition to the integrated Intel graphics. Additionally, Apple introduced a cheaper lower-end 13-inch model which lacks the Touch Bar in favor of function keys, and has only two USB-C ports. The flash storage in the Touch Bar models is soldered to the logic board and is not upgradeable, while in the 13-inch model without Touch Bar, it is removable.[146][147]\\r\\nThe fourth generation MacBook Pro follows the design of the previous two generations with an all-metal unibody enclosure and separated black keys. A few apparent design changes are a thinner chassis, thinner screen bezel, larger trackpad, the OLED Touch Bar, and shallower butterfly mechanism keyboard with less key separation than the previous models. The speakers grilles have been relocated to the sides of the keyboard on the 13-inch variant. Tear downs show that the speaker grilles on the 13-inch model with Touch Bar are \\"largely cosmetic\\", and that sound output mostly comes through the side vents.[148] The fourth generation MacBook Pro comes in two finishes, the traditional silver color and a darker \\"space gray\\" color. The MacBook Pro model name returns to the bottom of the screen bezel in Apple's San Francisco font after being absent from the third generation. Similar to the Retina MacBook, the new models replace the backlit Apple logo on the rear of the screen with a glossy opaque version.\\r\\nMagSafe, a magnetic charging connector, has been replaced with USB-C charging.[139] Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the users field of view to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a chime when connected to power.[139] The Macintosh startup chime that has been used since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.[139]\\r\\nThe 2016 MacBook Pro received mixed reviews. Ars Technica noted that the keyboard was a \\"drastic departure\\" from previous MacBook Pro keyboards, being a second-generation version of the keyboard used in the Retina MacBook. It further noted that resting palms may brush the trackpad occasionally causing inadvertent cursor jumps onscreen as the laptop interprets this as input, without one's hands or wrists actually resting on it.[139] Also noted was an increase of bandwidth and approximately 40 percent increased read speed of the flash storage.[139] Engadget praised the thinner, lighter design, improved display and audio, and increased speed of the graphics and flash storage, but criticized the lack of ports and price.[149] Wired praised the display, calling it \\"the best laptop display I've ever seen\\", as well as praising the Touch Bar, though it criticized the need of adapters for many common connectors.[150] Likewise, The Verge concluded that \\"using [the new MacBook] is alienating to anyone living in the present. I agree with Apple's vision of the future. I'm just not buying it today.\\"[151]\\r\\nOther well-known review outlets, like Engadget, voiced their concerns over Apple \\"by doing things like removing full-sized USB ports, the memory card reader and even the Function row, Apple seems to forgotten how many of us actually work\\"[152]. This goes unison with the wider blogosphere and review scene where foremost the touch bar was criticized for providing a negative impact on a user's concentration and usability: \\"The cognitive footprint of direct second screen interactions is significantly higher than that of indirect interactions[153]\\". Other items of critique frequently where non-compatibility between Thunderbolt 2 and 3 devices, frequently unpleasant fan whine noises[154] in idle CPU states on the larger screen (15\\") models were reported, where the two integrated fans run all the time by default. Responsible for this behaviour are the Co-Processor powering the touch bar and higher TDP of the stronger CPU models.\\r\\nThe battery life of the new models also received mixed reception, with outlets reporting inconsistent battery life and inaccurate estimates of time remaining on battery by the operating system. Apple addressed the latter by hiding the display of estimated battery time remaining entirely in a macOS update.[155][156] Consumer Reports did not initially recommend the 2016 MacBook Pro models, citing inconsistent and unpredictable battery life in its lab testing (which involves the consecutive loading of multiple websites). However, Apple and Consumer Reports found that the results had been affected by a bug caused by disabling caching in Safari's developer tools. Consumer Reports performed the tests again with a patched macOS, and retracted its original assessment.[157][158]\\r\\niFixit gave the models their lowest possible score of 1 out of 10 for repairability, noting that memory, the processor, and flash storage are soldered to the logic board, while the battery is glued to the case.

EFI handles booting differently from BIOS-based computers,[178] but provides backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software.[77][179] Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported.[180] This is made possible by the presence of the Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI.[181][182]\\r\\nAs the MacBook Pro uses a different hardware platform from earlier PowerPC (PPC)-based Macintoshes, versions of OS X prior to Lion can run PPC applications only via the Rosetta emulator, which exacts some performance penalty, cannot emulate some lower-level PPC code, and does not support 64-bit (G5 specific) PPC features.[183] Rosetta is not present in Lion and later, so PPC applications cannot be run under those versions of OS X.[184]","input":"When was the latest macbook pro retina released?"},{"output":"a stylized lily","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis/fleur-de-lys  (plural: fleurs-de-lis/fleurs-de-lys)[pron 1] or flower-de-luce[citation needed] is a stylized lily (in French, fleur means \\"flower\\", and lis means \\"lily\\") that is used as a decorative design or motif, and many of the Catholic saints of France, particularly St. Joseph, are depicted with a lily.  Since France is a historically Catholic nation, the fleur-de-lis became \\"at one and the same time, religious, political, dynastic, artistic, emblematic, and symbolic\\", especially in French heraldry.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis is represented in Unicode at U+269C (?) in the Miscellaneous Symbols block.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the fleur-de-lis has appeared on countless European coats of arms and flags over the centuries, it is particularly associated with the French monarchy in a historical context, and continues to appear in the arms of the King of Spain (from the French House of Bourbon) and the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and members of the House of Bourbon. It remains an enduring symbol of France which appears on French postage stamps, although it has never been adopted officially by any of the French republics. According to French historian Georges Duby, the three petals represent the three medieval social estates: the commoners, the nobility, and the clergy.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt remains unclear where the fleur-de-lis originated, though it has retained an association with French nobility. It is widely used in French city emblems as in the coat of arms of the city of Lille, Saint-Denis, Brest, Clermont-Ferrand, Boulogne-Billancourt and Calais. Some cities that had been particularly faithful to the French Crown were awarded[by whom?] a heraldic augmentation of two or three fleurs-de-lis on the chief of their coat of arms; such cities include Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Reims, Le Havre, Angers, Le Mans, Aix-en-Provence, Tours, Limoges, Amiens, Orlans, Rouen, Argenteuil, Poitiers, Chartres and Laon among others. The fleur-de-lis was the symbol of ?le-de-France, the core of the French kingdom. It has appeared on the coat-of-arms of other historical provinces of France including Burgundy, Anjou, Picardy, Berry, Orlanais, Bourbonnais, Maine, Touraine, Artois, Dauphin, Saintonge and the County of La Marche. Many of the current French departments use the symbol on their coats-of-arms to express this heritage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Italy, the fleur de lis, called giglio, is mainly known from the crest of the city of Florence. In the Florentine fleurs-de-lis,[f] the stamens are always posed between the petals. Originally argent (silver or white) on gules (red) background, the emblem became the standard of the imperial party in Florence (parte ghibellina), causing the town government, which maintained a staunch Guelph stance, being strongly opposed to the imperial pretensions on city states, to reverse the color pattern to the final gules lily on argent background.[6] This heraldic charge is often known as the Florentine lily to distinguish it from the conventional (stamen-not-shown) design. As an emblem of the city, it is therefore found in icons of Zenobius, its first bishop,[7] and associated with Florence's patron Saint John the Baptist in the Florentine fiorino. Several towns subjugated by Florence or founded within the territory of the Florentine Republic adopted a variation of the Florentine lily in their crests, often without the stamens.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heraldic fleur-de-lis is still widespread: among the numerous cities which use it as a symbol are some whose names echo the word 'lily', for example, Liljendal, Finland, and Lelystad, Netherlands. This is called canting arms in heraldic terminology. Other European examples of municipal coats-of-arms bearing the fleur-de-lis include Lincoln in England, Morcn in Spain, Wiesbaden in Germany, Skierniewice in Poland and Jurbarkas in Lithuania. The Swiss municipality of Schlieren and the Estonian municipality of J?el?htme also have a fleur-de-lis on their coats.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Malta, the town of Santa Venera has three red fleurs-de-lis on its flag and coat of arms. These are derived from an arch which was part of the Wignacourt Aqueduct that had three sculpted fleurs-de-lis on top, as they were the heraldic symbols of Alof de Wignacourt, the Grand Master who financed its building. Another suburb which developed around the area became known as Fleur-de-Lys, and it also features a red fleur-de-lis on its flag and coat of arms.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coat of arms of the medieval Kingdom of Bosnia contained six fleurs-de-lis, understood as the native Bosnian or Golden Lily, Lilium bosniacum.[9] This emblem was revived in 1992 as a national symbol of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and was the flag of Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1992 to 1998.[10] The state insignia were changed in 1999. The former flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina contains a fleur-de-lis alongside the Croatian chequy. Fleurs also appear in the flags and arms of many cantons, municipalities, cities and towns. It is still used as official insignia of the Bosniak Regiment of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, a fleur-de-lis has appeared in the official arms of the Norroy King of Arms for hundreds of years. A silver fleur-de-lis on a blue background is the arms of the Barons Digby.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn English and Canadian heraldry the fleur-de-lis is the cadence mark of a sixth son.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mauritius, slaves were branded with a fleur-de-lis, when being punished for escaping or stealing food.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Welsh poet Hedd Wyn used Fleur de Lys as his pen name when he won his chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales (Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru), the national poetry contest.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleurs-de-lis appear on military insignia and the logos of many organizations. During the 20th century the symbol was adopted by various Scouting organizations worldwide for their badges. Architects and designers use it alone and as a repeated motif in a wide range of contexts, from ironwork to bookbinding, especially where a French context is implied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe symbol is also often used on a compass rose to mark the north direction, a tradition started by Pedro Reinel.\\r\\nThe dark code was an arrangement of controls received in Louisiana in 1724 from other French settlements around the globe, intended to represent the state's slave populace. Those guidelines included marking slaves with the fleur-de-lis as discipline for fleeing.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fleur de lis is widely thought to be a stylized version of the species Iris pseudacorus, or Iris florentina.[16][17] \\r\\nHowever, the lily (genus lilium, family Liliaceae) and the iris (family Iridaceae) are two different plants, phylogenetically and taxonomically unrelated. Lily (in Italian: giglio) is the name usually associated with the stylized flower in the Florentine heraldic devices.\\r\\nDecorative ornaments that resemble the fleur-de-lis have appeared in artwork from the earliest human civilizations.[citation needed] According to Pierre-Augustin Boissier de Sauvages, an 18th-century French naturalist and lexicographer:[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old fleurs-de-lis, especially the ones found in our first kings' sceptres, have a lot less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called flambas [in Occitan], or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, is the fact that the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Leie in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises as many plants grow for centuries in the same places: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of lis. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.\\r\\nThe heraldist Fran?ois Velde is of the same opinion.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a hypothesis ventured in the 17th c. sounds very plausible to me. One species of wild iris, the Iris pseudacorus, yellow flag in English, is yellow and grows in marshes (cf. the azure field, for water). Its name in German is Lieschblume (also gelbe Schwertlilie), but Liesch was also spelled Lies and Leys in the Middle Ages. It is easy to imagine that, in Northern France, the Lieschblume would have been called \\"fleur-de-lis.\\" This would explain the name and the formal origin of the design, as a stylized yellow flag. There is a fanciful legend about Clovis which links the yellow flag explicitly with the French coat of arms.\\r\\nSauvages' hypothesis seems to be supported by the archaic English spelling fleur-de-luce[21] and by the Luts's variant name Lits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has consistently been used as a royal emblem, though different cultures have interpreted its meaning in varying ways. Gaulish coins show the first Western designs which look similar to modern fleurs-de-lis.[22] In the East it was found on the gold helmet of a Scythian king uncovered at the Ak-Burun kurgan and conserved in Saint Petersburg's Hermitage Museum.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a statue of Kanishka the Great, the emperor of the Kushan dynasty in 127ÿ151 AD, in the Mathura Museum in India, with four modern Fleurs-de-lis symbols in a square emblem repeated twice on the bottom end of his smaller sword.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother (debated) hypothesis is that the symbol derives from the Frankish Angon.\\r\\nThe angon, or sting, was a typical Frankish throwing spear.\\r\\n\\r\\nA possibly derived symbol of Frankish royalty was the bee, of similar shape, as found in the burial of Childric I, whose royal see of power over the Salian Franks was based over the valley of the Lys.\\r\\nAnother heraldic tradition, going back to at least the 17th century, identifies the emblem of the Childric as a frog or toad (crapaud) rather than a bee. Antoine Court de Gbelin writing in 1781 identified the toad as the emblem of the Ripuarian Franks, representing their origin from the marshlands.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe golden bees/flies discovered in the tomb of Childeric in 1653\\r\\n\\r\\nSeal of Philippe Auguste (1180)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe graphic evolution of crita to fleur-de-lis was accompanied by textual allegory. By the late 13th century, an allegorical poem by Guillaume de Nangis (d. 1300), written at the abbey of Joyenval at Chambourcy, relates how the golden lilies on an azure ground were miraculously substituted for the crescents on Clovis' shield, a projection into the past of contemporary images of heraldry. Through this propagandist connection to Clovis, the fleur-de-lis has been taken in retrospect to symbolize all the Christian Frankish kings, most notably Charlemagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis' symbolic origins with French monarchs may stem from the baptismal lily used in the crowning of King Clovis I.[25] The French monarchy possibly adopted the Fleur-de-lis for its royal coat of arms as a symbol of purity to commemorate the conversion of Clovis I,[26] and a reminder of the Fleur-de-lis ampulla that held the oil used to anoint the king. So, the fleur-de-lis stood as a symbol of the king's divinely approved right to rule. The thus \\"anointed\\" Kings of France later maintained that their authority was directly from God. A legend enhances the mystique of royalty by informing us that a vial of oilthe Holy Ampulladescended from Heaven to anoint and sanctify Clovis as King,[27] descending directly on Clovis or perhaps brought by a dove to Saint Remigius. One version explains that an angel descended with the Fleur-de-lis ampulla to anoint the king.[28] Another story tells of Clovis putting a flower in his helmet just before his victory at the Battle of Vouill.[20] Through this connection to Clovis, the fleur-de-lis has been taken to symbolize all the Christian Frankish kings, most famously Charlemagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 14th-century French writers asserted that the monarchy of France, which developed from the Kingdom of the West Franks, could trace its heritage back to the divine gift of royal arms received by Clovis. This story has remained popular, even though modern scholarship has established that the fleur-de-lis was a religious symbol before it was a true heraldic symbol.[29] Along with true lilies, it was associated with the Virgin Mary, and in the 12th century Louis VI and Louis VII started to use the emblem, on sceptres for example, so connecting their rulership with this symbol of saintliness and divine right. Louis VII ordered the use of fleur-de-lis clothing in his son Philip's coronation in 1179,[30] while the first visual evidence of clearly heraldic use dates from 1211: a seal showing the future Louis VIII and his shield strewn with the \\"flowers\\".[31] Until the late 14th century the French royal coat of arms was Azure sem-de-lis Or (a blue shield \\"sown\\" (sem) with a scattering of small golden fleurs-de-lis), but Charles V of France changed the design from an all-over scattering to a group of three in about 1376.[a][b] These two coats are known in heraldic terminology as France Ancient and France Modern respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the reign of King Louis IX (St. Louis) the three petals of the flower were said to represent faith, wisdom and chivalry, and to be a sign of divine favour bestowed on France.[32] During the next century, the 14th, the tradition of Trinity symbolism was established in France, and then spread elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1328, King Edward III of England inherited a claim to the crown of France, and in about 1340 he  quartered France Ancient with the arms of Plantagenet, as \\"arms of pretence\\".  [c] After the kings of France adopted France Modern, the kings of England adopted the new design as quarterings from about 1411.[33] The monarchs of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to quarter the French arms until 1801, when George III abandoned his formal claim to the French throne.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Charles VII ennobled Joan of Arc's family on 29 December 1429 with an inheritable symbolic denomination. The Chamber of Accounts in France registered the family's designation to nobility on 20 January 1430. The grant permitted the family to change their surname to du Lys.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance Modern remained the French royal standard, and with a white background was the French national flag until the French Revolution, when it was replaced by the tricolor of modern-day France. The fleur-de-lis was restored to the French flag in 1814, but replaced once again after the revolution against Charles X of France in 1830.[d] In a very strange turn of events after the end of the Second French Empire, where a flag apparently influenced the course of history, Henri, comte de Chambord, was offered the throne as King of France, but he agreed only if France gave up the tricolor and brought back the white flag with fleurs-de-lis.[34] His condition was rejected and France became a republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleurs-de-lis feature prominently in the Crown Jewels of England and Scotland. In English heraldry, they are used in many different ways, and can be the cadency mark of the sixth son. Additionally, it features in a large amount of royal arms of the House of Plantagenet, from the 13th century onwards to the early Tudors (Elizabeth of York and the de la Pole family.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tressure floryÿcounterflory (flowered border) has been a prominent part of the design of the Scottish royal arms and Royal Standard since James I of Scotland.[e]\\r\\n\\r\\n??????????The treasured fleur-de-luce he claims??????????To wreathe his shield, since royal James???????????????Sir Walter Scott????????????????The Lay of the Last Minstrel[35]\\r\\nIn Italy, fleurs-de-lis have been used for some papal crowns[g] and coats of arms, the Farnese Dukes of Parma, and by some doges of Venice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis was also the symbol of the House of Kotromani?, a ruling house in medieval Bosnia allegedly in recognition of the Capetian House of Anjou, where the flower is thought of as a Lilium bosniacum.[h] Today, fleur-de-lis is a national symbol of Bosniaks.[i]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther countries using the emblem heraldically include Serbia and Spain in recognition of rulers from the House of Bourbon. Coins minted in 14th-century Romania, from the region that was the Principality of Moldova at the time, ruled by Petru I Mu?at, carry the fleur-de-lis symbol.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a dynastic emblem it has also been very widely used: not only by noble families but also, for example, by the Fuggers, a medieval banking family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree fleurs-de-lis appeared in the personal coat of arms of Grandmaster Alof de Wignacourt who ruled the Malta between 1601 and 1622. His nephew Adrien de Wignacourt, who was Grandmaster himself from 1690 to 1697, also had a similar coat of arms with three fleurs-de-lis.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleurs-de-lis crossed the Atlantic along with Europeans going to the New World, especially with French settlers. Their presence on North American flags and coats of arms usually recalls the involvement of French settlers in the history of the town or region concerned, and in some cases the persisting presence there of a population descended from such settlers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis appears on the Canadian coat of arms, the flag of Quebec as well as the flags of the cities of Montreal, Sherbrooke and Trois-Rivires. It is also featured on the personal flag used by the Queen of Canada.[37] There are many French-speaking people in other Canadian provinces for whom the fleur-de-lis remains a symbol of their cultural identity. Franco-Ontarians, for example, feature the fleur-de-lis prominently on their flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US, the fleur-de-lis symbols tend to be along or near the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. These are areas of strong French colonial empire settlement. Some of the places that have it in their flag or seal are the cities of St. Louis,[m] Louisville, Detroit, Mobile, New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Lafayette. On 9 July 2008, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal signed a bill into law making the fleur-de-lis an official symbol of the state.[38] Following Hurricane Katrina, the fleur-de-lis has been widely used in New Orleans and throughout Louisiana, as a symbol of grassroots support for New Orleans' recovery.[39] \\r\\nIt has also become the symbol for the identity of the Cajuns and Louisiana Creole people, and their French heritage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis appears on the coat of Guadeloupe, an overseas dpartement of France in the Caribbean, Saint Barthlemy, an overseas collectivity of France, and French Guiana. The overseas department of Runion in the Indian Ocean uses the same feature. It appears on the coat of Port Louis, the capital of Mauritius which was named in honour of King Louis XV. On the coat of arms of Saint Lucia it represents the French heritage of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Saskatchewan the Western Red Lily appears on the provincial flag and is sometimes used as a symbol of the province. Some representations resemble a fleur de lis but the traditional version itself is rarely used.\\r\\nIn the Middle Ages, the symbols of lily and fleur-de-lis overlapped considerably in Christian religious art. Michel Pastoureau, a historian, says that until about 1300 they were found in depictions of Jesus, but gradually they took on Marian symbolism and were associated with the Song of Solomon's \\"lily among thorns\\" (lilium inter spinas), understood as a reference to Mary. Other scripture and religious literature in which the lily symbolizes purity and chastity also helped establish the flower as an iconographic attribute of the Virgin. It was also believed that the fleur-de-lis represented the Holy Trinity.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn medieval England, from the mid-12th century, a noblewoman's seal often showed the lady with a fleur-de-lis, drawing on the Marian connotations of \\"female virtue and spirituality\\".[43] Images of Mary holding the flower first appeared in the 11th century on coins issued by cathedrals dedicated to her, and next on the seals of cathedral chapters, starting with Notre Dame de Paris in 1146. A standard portrayal was of Mary carrying the flower in her right hand, just as she is shown in that church's Virgin of Paris statue (with lily), and in the centre of the stained glass rose window (with fleur-de-lis sceptre) above its main entrance. The flowers may be \\"simple fleurons, sometimes garden lilies, sometimes genuine heraldic fleurs-de-lis\\".[31] As attributes of the Madonna, they are often seen in pictures of the Annunciation, notably in those of Sandro Botticelli and Filippo Lippi. Lippi also uses both flowers in other related contexts: for instance, in his Madonna in the Forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three petals of the heraldic design reflect a widespread association with the Holy Trinity, with the band on the bottom symbolizing Mary. The tradition says that without Mary you can not understand the Trinity since it was she who bore the Son.[44] A tradition going back to 14th century France[22] added onto the earlier belief that they also represented faith, wisdom and chivalry. Alternatively, the cord can be seen as representing the one Divine Substance (godhood) of the three Persons, which binds Them together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Flower of light\\" symbolism has sometimes been understood from the archaic variant fleur-de-luce (see Latin lux, luc- = \\"light\\"), but the Oxford English Dictionary suggests this arose from the spelling, not from the etymology.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn building and architecture, the fleur-de-lis is often placed on top of iron fence posts, as a pointed defence against intruders. It may ornament any tip, point or post with a decorative flourish, for instance, on finials, the arms of a cross, or the point of a gable. The fleur-de-lis can be incorporated in friezes or cornices, although the distinctions between fleur-de-lis, fleuron, and other stylized flowers are not always clear,[19][46] or can be used as a motif in an all-over tiled pattern, perhaps on a floor.\\r\\nIt may appear in a building for heraldic reasons, as in some English churches where the design paid a compliment to a local lord who used the flower on his coat of arms. Elsewhere the effect seems purely visual, like the crenellations on the 14th-century Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan.\\r\\nIt can also be seen on the doors of 16th-century Padmanabhaswamy Temple.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome modern usage of the fleur-de-lis reflects \\"the continuing presence of heraldry in everyday life\\", often intentionally, but also when users are not aware that they are \\"prolonging the life of centuries-old insignia and emblems\\".[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nFleurs-de-lis are featured on military badges like those of the United States Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment, 62nd Medical Brigade, 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team and the Corps of Cadets at Louisiana State University.  It is also featured by the Israeli Intelligence Corps, and the First World War Canadian Expeditionary Force. In the British Army, the fleur-de-lis was the cap badge of the Manchester Regiment from 1922 until 1958, and also its successor, the King's Regiment up to its amalgamation in 2006. It commemorates the capture of French regimental colours by their predecessors, the 63rd Regiment of Foot, during the Invasion of Martinique in 1759.[48] It is also the formation sign of the 2nd (Independent) Armored Brigade of the Indian Army which was known as 7th Indian Cavalry Brigade in First World War, received the emblem for its actions in France.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis is used by a number of sports teams, especially when it echoes a local flag. This is true with the former Quebec Nordiques National Hockey League team and the former Montreal Expos Major League Baseball team, the Serie A team Fiorentina, the Bundesliga side SV Darmstadt 98 (also known as Die Lilien ÿ The Lilies), the Major League Soccer team the Montreal Impact, the sports teams of New Orleans, Louisiana in the NFL, NBA and the Pacific Coast League, the Rugby League team Wakefield Trinity Wildcats and the NPSL team Detroit City FC. Marc-Andr Fleury, a Canadian ice hockey goaltender, has a fleur-de-lis logo on his mask. The UFC Welterweight Champion from 2006 to 2013, Georges St-Pierre, has a tattoo of the fleur-de-lis on his right calf. The IT University of Copenhagen's soccer team ITU F.C. has it in their logo.[50] France uses the symbol in the official emblem on the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup [51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emblem appears in coats of arms and logos for universities (like the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and Saint Louis University and Washington University in Missouri) and schools such as in Hilton College (South Africa), St. Peter, Minnesota, Adamson University and St. Pauls University in the Philippines. The Lady Knights of the University of Arkansas at Monticello have also adopted the fleur de lis as one of the symbols associated with their coat of arms. The flag of Lincolnshire, adopted in 2005, has a fleur-de-lis for the city of Lincoln. It is one of the symbols of the American sororities Kappa Kappa Gamma and Theta Phi Alpha, the American fraternities Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Alpha Mu, as well as the international co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega. It is also used by the high school and college fraternity Scouts Royale Brotherhood of the Philippines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis is the main element in the logo of most Scouting organizations. The symbol was first used by Sir Robert Baden-Powell as an arm-badge for soldiers who qualified as scouts (reconnaissance specialists) in the 5th Dragoon Guards, which he commanded at the end of the 19th century; it was later used in cavalry regiments throughout the British Army until 1921. In 1907, Baden-Powell made brass fleur-de-lis badges for the boys attending his first experimental \\"Boy Scout\\" camp at Brownsea Island.[52] In his seminal book Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell referred to the motif as \\"the arrowhead which shows the North on a map or a compass\\" and continued; \\"It is the Badge of the Scout because it points in the right direction and upward... The three points remind you of the three points of the Scout Promise\\",[53] being duty to God and country, helping others and keeping the Scout Law. The World Scout Emblem of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, has elements which are used by most national Scout organizations. The stars stand for truth and knowledge, the encircling rope for unity, and its reef knot or square knot, service.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe symbol may be used in less traditional ways. After Hurricane Katrina many New Orleanians of varying ages and backgrounds were tattooed with \\"one of its cultural emblems\\" as a \\"memorial\\" of the storm, according to a researcher at Tulane University.[55] The US Navy Blue Angels have named a looping flight demonstration manoeuvre after the flower as well, and there are even two surgical procedures called \\"after the fleur.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican automobile manufacturer Chevrolet takes its name from the racing driver Louis Chevrolet, who was born in Switzerland.  But, because the Chevrolet name is French, the manufacturer has used the fleur-de-lis emblems on their cars, most notably the Corvette, but also as a small detail in the badges and emblems on the front of a variety of full-size Chevys from the 1950s, and 1960s.  The fleur-de-lis has also been featured more prominently in the emblems of the Caprice sedan.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fleur-de-lis also appears in some of the logos of local Louisiana media. Such as in the logo of WGNO-TV, the local ABC-affiliated television station in New Orleans, and WVUE-TV, the local Fox-affiliated television station in New Orleans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis is one of the objects to drop during the New Year's Eve celebrations in New Orleans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe symbol has featured in modern fiction on historical and mystical themes, as in the bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code and other books discussing the Priory of Sion. It recurs in French literature, where examples well known in English translation include Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier, a character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame by Victor Hugo, and the mention in Dumas's The Three Musketeers of the old custom of branding a criminal with the sign (fleurdeliser). During the reign of Elizabeth I of England, known as the Elizabethan era, it was a standard name for an iris, a usage which lasted for centuries,[56] but occasionally refers to lilies or other flowers. It also appeared in the novel A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole on a sign composed by the main character.\\r\\n\\r\\nExplanatory notes\\r\\n\\r\\nCitations","input":"What kind of flower is the fleur de lis?"},{"output":"0.5ÿ0.75% as fresh groundwater and soil moisture, and less than 0.01% of it as surface water in lakes, swamps and rivers","context":"Fresh water (or freshwater) is naturally occurring water on Earth's surface in ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers and streams, and underground as groundwater. Fresh water is generally characterized by having low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total dissolved solids. The term specifically excludes seawater and brackish water although it does include mineral-rich waters such as chalybeate springs.\\r\\nFresh water is not the same as potable water (or drinking water): Much of the earth's surface fresh water and groundwater is unsuitable for drinking without some form of treatment. This is because fresh water can be polluted by human activities or it may be contaminated due to naturally occurring processes.\\r\\nThe term \\"sweet water\\" is used to describe fresh water in contrast to salt water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water habitats are divided into lentic systems, which are the stillwaters including ponds, lakes, swamps and mires; lotic, or running-water systems; and groundwater which flows in rocks and aquifers. There is, in addition, a zone which bridges between groundwater and lotic systems, which is the hyporheic zone, which underlies many larger rivers and can contain substantially more water than is seen in the open channel. It may also be in direct contact with the underlying underground water.\\r\\nThe majority of fresh water on Earth is in ice caps.\\r\\nThe source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled. In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.\\r\\nIn coastal areas fresh water may contain significant concentrations of salts derived from the sea if windy conditions have lifted drops of seawater into the rain-bearing clouds. This can give rise to elevated concentrations of sodium, chloride, magnesium and sulfate as well as many other compounds in smaller concentrations.\\r\\nIn desert areas, or areas with impoverished or dusty soils, rain-bearing winds can pick up sand and dust and this can be deposited elsewhere in precipitation and causing the freshwater flow to be measurably contaminated both by insoluble solids but also by the soluble components of those soils. Significant quantities of iron may be transported in this way including the well-documented transfer of iron-rich rainfall falling in Brazil derived from sand-storms in the Sahara in north Africa.\\r\\nWater is a critical issue for the survival of all living organisms. Some can use salt water but many organisms including the great majority of higher plants and most mammals must have access to fresh water to live. Some terrestrial mammals, especially desert rodents appear to survive without drinking but they do generate water through the metabolism of cereal seeds and they also have mechanisms to conserve water to the maximum degree.\\r\\nOut of all the water on Earth, saline water in oceans, seas and saline groundwater make up about 97% of it. Only 2.5ÿ2.75% is fresh water, including 1.75ÿ2% frozen in glaciers, ice and snow, 0.5ÿ0.75% as fresh groundwater and soil moisture, and less than 0.01% of it as surface water in lakes, swamps and rivers.[2][3] Freshwater lakes contain about 87% of this fresh surface water, including 29% in the African Great Lakes, 22% in Lake Baikal in Russia, 21% in the North American Great Lakes, and 14% in other lakes. Swamps have most of the balance with only a small amount in rivers, most notably the Amazon River. The atmosphere contains 0.04% water.[4] In areas with no fresh water on the ground surface, fresh water derived from precipitation may, because of its lower density, overlie saline ground water in lenses or layers. Most of the world's fresh water is frozen in ice sheets. Many areas suffer from lack of distribution of fresh water, such as deserts.\\r\\nFresh water can be defined as water with less than 500 parts per million (ppm) of dissolved salts.[5]\\r\\nOther sources give higher upper salinity limits for fresh water, e.g. 1000 ppm[6] or 3000 ppm.[7]\\r\\nFresh water creates a hypotonic environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for some organisms with pervious skins or with gill membranes, whose cell membranes may burst if excess water is not excreted. Some protists accomplish this using contractile vacuoles, while freshwater fish excrete excess water via the kidney.[8] Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, diadromous fish have the ability to migrate between fresh water and saline water bodies. During these migrations they undergo changes to adapt to the surroundings of the changed salinities; these processes are hormonally controlled. The eel (Anguilla anguilla) uses the hormone prolactin,[9] while in salmon (Salmo salar) the hormone cortisol plays a key role during this process.[10]\\r\\nMany sea birds have special glands at the base of the bill through which excess salt is excreted. Similarly the marine iguanas on the Galpagos Islands excrete excess salt through a nasal gland and they sneeze out a very salty excretion.\\r\\nFreshwater molluscs include freshwater snails and freshwater bivalves. Freshwater crustaceans include freshwater crabs, and others.\\r\\nAn important concern for hydrological ecosystems is securing minimum streamflow, especially preserving and restoring instream water allocations.[11] Fresh water is an important natural resource necessary for the survival of all ecosystems. The use of water by humans for activities such as irrigation and industrial applications can have adverse impacts on down-stream ecosystems. Chemical contamination of fresh water can also seriously damage eco-systems.\\r\\nPollution from human activity, including oil spills and also presents a problem for freshwater resources. The largest petroleum spill that has ever occurred in fresh water was caused by a Royal Dutch Shell tank ship in Magdalena, Argentina, on 15 January 1999, polluting the environment, drinkable water, plants and animals.[12]\\r\\nFresh and unpolluted water accounts for 0.003% of total water available globally.[13]\\r\\nChanging landscape for the use of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of fresh water. Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and soils changes the flow of fresh water in the local environment and also affects the cycle of fresh water. As a result, more fresh water is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture. However, since agriculture is the human activity that consumes the most fresh water,[14] this can put a severe strain on local freshwater resources resulting in the destruction of local ecosystems.\\r\\nIn Australia, over-abstraction of fresh water for intensive irrigation activities has caused 33% of the land area to be at risk of salination.[14] With regards to agriculture, the World Bank targets food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that will foster debate.[15]\\r\\nFresh water is a renewable and variable, but finite natural resource. Fresh water can only be replenished through the process of the water cycle, in which water from seas, lakes, forests, land, rivers, and reservoirs evaporates, forms clouds, and returns as precipitation. Locally however, if more fresh water is consumed through human activities than is naturally restored, this may result in reduced fresh water availability from surface and underground sources and can cause serious damage to surrounding and associated environments.\\r\\nFresh water withdrawal is the quantity of water removed from available sources for use in any purpose, excluding evaporation losses. Water drawn off is not necessarily entirely consumed and some portion may be returned for further use downstream.\\r\\nThe increase in the world population and the increase in per capita water use puts increasing strains on the finite resources avialability of clean fresh water The World Bank adds that the response by freshwater ecosystems to a changing climate can be described in terms of three interrelated components: water quality, water quantity or volume, and water timing. A change in one often leads to shifts in the others as well.[16] Water pollution and subsequent eutrophication also reduces the availability of fresh water.[17]\\r\\nMany areas of the world are already experiencing stress on water availability. Due to the accelerated pace of population growth and an increase in the amount of water a single person uses, it is expected that this situation will continue to get worse. A shortage of water in the future would be detrimental to the human population as it would affect everything from sanitation, to overall health and the production of grain.[18]\\r\\nWith one in eight people in the world not having access to safe water[19] it is important to use this resource in a prudent manner. Making the best use of water on a local basis probably provides the best solution. Local communities need to plan their use of fresh water and should be made aware of how certain crops and animals use water.\\r\\nAs a guide the following tables provide some indicators.\\r\\nTable 1 Recommended basic water requirements for human needs (per person) [20]\\r\\nTable 2.

It is located northeast of Taos and south of Red River in the northern part of the state, and just 2 miles (3.2?km) southeast of the ski slopes of Taos Ski Valley. It lies in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains. The peak's elevation is 13,167 feet (4,013?m).\\r\\n\\r\\nFormerly named Taos Peak, after the nearby town of Taos, New Mexico, it was renamed Wheeler Peak in 1950.[3] A plaque at the summit states that the mountain was:\\r\\n\\r\\nNamed in honor of Major George Montague Wheeler (1842ÿ1905) who for ten years led a party of surveyors and naturalists collecting geologic, biologic, planimetric and topographic data in New Mexico and six other southwestern states.\\r\\nJust north of Wheeler Peak is Mount Walter. At 13,141 feet (4,005?m) it is the second highest named summit in New Mexico, but it is not usually considered an independent peak as it has only about 53 feet (16?m) of topographic prominence. It is sometimes mistaken for Wheeler Peak, since it is along the standard route to Wheeler. Lake Fork Peak at 12,881 feet (3,926?m) lies just across Williams Lake and to the west of Wheeler Mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaos Ski Valley lies to the northwest of Wheeler Peak, while both the town of Taos and Taos Pueblo are about 15 miles (24?km) to the southwest. \\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler Peak is the focus of the 19,661-acre (79.57?km2) Wheeler Peak Wilderness area in the Carson National Forest. Much of the mountain area just south of the peak is on Taos Pueblo land. Some 48,000 acres (190?km2) was returned to the pueblo from the Carson National Forest in 1970[4]\\r\\nand another 764 acres (3.09?km2) in 1996.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard route on Wheeler Peak is along the north ridge. The route starts at the parking lot for Taos Ski Valley, and proceeds east along an old road to a broad saddle at Bull-of-the-Woods Meadow. It then turns south and winds its way among minor peaks and small valleys to gain Wheeler Peak from the north, going over the summit of Mount Walter along the way. This is a practical route, even in winter, due to low (but nonzero) avalanche exposure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternate route is to hike south from Taos Ski Valley to Williams Lake, then take a newly constructed switchback trail to the top.  This trail was completed in 2011 by a Forest Service trail crew from the Gallatin National Forest, 8 people working 12 hours per day, building 4 miles of new trail with hand tools to the top in 14 days.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother alternate route is to begin from the nearby ski resort of Red River.  From the town of Red River drive 6.4 miles south on NM 578, then 1.3 miles on FR 58 to the trailhead parking area.  From the parking area Wheeler peak is about 7 miles on Forest Trail 91.

Morris in 1973 identified the following seven figures as the key Founding Fathers: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington.[3][4] Adams, Jefferson, and Franklin were members of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay were authors of The Federalist Papers, advocating ratification of the Constitution. The constitutions drafted by Jay and Adams for their respective states of New York (1777) and Massachusetts (1780) were heavily relied upon when creating language for the US Constitution [5] Jay, Adams and Franklin negotiated the Treaty of Paris (1783) that would end the American Revolutionary War.[6] Washington was Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army and was President of the Constitutional Convention. Washington, Jay and Franklin are considered the Founding Fathers of U.S. Intelligence by the CIA.[7] All held additional important roles in the early government of the United States, with Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison serving as President. Jay was the nation's first Chief Justice. Four of these seven - Washington, Jay, Hamilton and Madison - were not signers of the Declaration of Independence.[8]\\r\\nThe term Founding Fathers is sometimes used to refer to the Signers of the embossed version of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.[9] It is not to be confused with the term Framers; the Framers are defined by the National Archives as those 55 individuals who were appointed to be delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention and took part in drafting the proposed Constitution of the United States. Of the 55 Framers, only 39 were signers of the Constitution.[10][11] Two further groupings of Founding Fathers include: 1) those who signed the Continental Association, a trade ban and one of the colonists' first collective volleys protesting British control and the Intolerable Acts in 1774 [12] or 2) those who signed the Articles of Confederation, the first U.S. constitutional document.[13]\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Founding Fathers\\" is a twentieth-century appellation, coined by Warren G. Harding in 1916.[14] In the 19th century, they were referred to as simply, the \\"Fathers\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Continental Congress met briefly in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1774, consisting of fifty-six delegates from twelve of the thirteen colonies (excluding Georgia) that became the United States of America. Among them was George Washington, who would soon be drawn out of military retirement to command the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Also in attendance was Patrick Henry, and John Adams, who like all delegates were elected by their respective colonial assemblies. Other delegates included Samuel Adams from Massachusetts, John Dickinson from Pennsylvania and New York's John Jay. This congress in addition to formulating appeals to the British crown, established the Continental Association to administer boycott actions against Britain.\\r\\nWhen the Second Continental Congress convened on May 10, 1775, it essentially reconstituted the First Congress. Many of the same 56 delegates who attended the first meeting participated in the second.[15] New arrivals included Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, John Hancock of Massachusetts, and John Witherspoon of New Jersey. Hancock was elected Congress President two weeks into the session when Peyton Randolph was recalled to Virginia to preside over the House of Burgesses. Thomas Jefferson replaced Randolph in the Virginia congressional delegation.[16] The second Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. Witherspoon was the only active clergyman to sign the Declaration. He also signed the Articles of Confederation and attended the New Jersey (1787) convention that ratified the Federal Constitution.[17]\\r\\nThe newly founded country of the United States had to create a new government to replace the British Parliament. The U.S. adopted the Articles of Confederation, a declaration that established a national government with a one-house legislature. Its ratification by all thirteen colonies gave the second Congress a new name: the Congress of the Confederation, which met from 1781 to 1789.[18] Later, the Constitutional Convention took place during the summer of 1787, in Philadelphia.[19] Although the Convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, the intention from the outset for some including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton was to create a new frame of government rather than amending the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention. The result of the Convention was the United States Constitution.\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers represented a cross-section of 18th-century U.S. leadership. Almost all of them were well-educated men of means who were leaders in their communities. Many were also prominent in national affairs. Virtually every one had taken part in the American Revolution; at least 29 had served in the Continental Army, most of them in positions of command. Scholars have examined the collective biography of them as well as the signers of the Declaration and the Constitution.[20]\\r\\nMany of the Founding Fathers attended or held degrees from the colonial colleges, most notably Columbia, Princeton, Harvard, the College of William and Mary, Yale and University of Pennsylvania. Some had previously been home schooled or obtained early instruction from private tutors or academies.[21] Others had studied abroad. Ironically, Benjamin Franklin who had little formal education himself would ultimately establish the University of Pennsylvania based on European models (1740); \\"Penn\\" would have the first medical school (1765) in the thirteen colonies where another Founder, Benjamin Rush would eventually teach.\\r\\nWith a limited number of professional schools established in the U.S., Founders also sought advanced degrees from traditional institutions in England and Scotland such as the University of Edinburgh and University of St. Andrews.\\r\\nSeveral like John Jay, James Wilson, John Williams and George Wythe[25] were trained as lawyers through apprenticeships in the colonies while a few trained at the Inns of Court in London.\\r\\nFranklin, Washington, John Williams and Henry Wisner had little formal education and were largely self-taught or learned through apprenticeship.\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers had extensive political experience. Many had been members of the Continental Congress. Nearly all of the 55 Constitutional Convention delegates had experience in colonial and state government, and the majority had held county and local offices.[26]\\r\\nHistorian Caroline Robbins in 1977 examined the status of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence and concluded:\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers practiced a wide range of high and middle-status occupations, and many pursued more than one career simultaneously. They did not differ dramatically from the Loyalists, except they were generally younger and less senior in their professions.[28] A few of them were wealthy or had financial resources that ranged from good to excellent, but there are other founders who were less than wealthy. On the whole they were less wealthy than the Loyalists.[29]\\r\\nFranklin T. Lambert (2003) has examined the religious affiliations and beliefs of the Founders. Of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, 28 were Anglicans (in the Church of England; or Episcopalian, after the American Revolutionary War was won), 21 were Protestants, and two were Roman Catholics (D. Carroll, and Fitzsimons).[32] Among the Protestant delegates to the Constitutional Convention, eight were Presbyterians, seven were Congregationalists, two were Lutherans, two were Dutch Reformed, and two were Methodists.[32]\\r\\nA few prominent Founding Fathers were anti-clerical Christians such as Thomas Jefferson,[33][34][35] who constructed the Jefferson Bible, and Benjamin Franklin.[36]\\r\\nHistorian Gregg L. Frazer argues that the leading Founders (Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Wilson, Morris, Madison, Hamilton, and Washington) were neither Christians nor Deists, but rather supporters of a hybrid \\"theistic rationalism\\".[37]\\r\\nThe Faiths of the Founding Fathers is a book that discusses the religion held by the founding fathers, written in 2006 by historian of U.S. religion David L. Holmes.\\r\\nOne of the greatest contradictions of the Founding Fathers was their disunity with regard to slavery at a time that they were seeking liberty for themselves. In her study of Thomas Jefferson, historian Annette Gordon-Reed emphasizes this irony, \\"Others of the founders held slaves, but no other founder drafted the charter for freedom, \\"[38] In addition to Jefferson, George Washington, John Jay and many other of the Founding Fathers practiced slavery but were also conflicted by the institution which many saw as immoral and politically divisive.[39] Benjamin Franklin owned slaves (though Franklin later became an abolitionist).[40] John Jay would try unsuccessfully to abolish slavery as early as 1777 in the State of New York but was overruled (though he would later sign the Gradual Emancipation Act into law while Governor).[41] Alexander Hamilton opposed slavery, as his experiences in life left him very familiar with slavery and its effect on slaves and on slaveholders,[42] although he did negotiate slave transactions for his wife's family, the Schuylers.[43] John Adams, Samuel Adams, and Thomas Paine never owned slaves [44]\\r\\nSlaves and slavery are mentioned only indirectly in the 1787 Constitution. For example, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 prescribes that \\"three fifths of all other Persons\\" are to be counted for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and direct taxes. Additionally, in Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3, slaves are referred to as \\"persons held in service or labor\\".[40][45] The Founding Fathers, however, did make important efforts to contain slavery. Many Northern states had adopted legislation to end or significantly reduce slavery during and after the American Revolution.[45] In 1782 Virginia passed a manumission law that allowed slave owners to free their slaves by will or deed.[46] As a result, thousands of slaves were manumitted in Virginia.[46] Thomas Jefferson, in 1784, proposed to ban slavery in all the Western Territories, which failed to pass Congress by one vote.[45] Partially following Jefferson's plan, Congress did ban slavery in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, for lands north of the Ohio River.[45]\\r\\nThe international slave trade was banned in all states except South Carolina, by 1800. Finally in 1807, President Jefferson called for and signed into law a Federally-enforced ban on the international slave trade throughout the U.S. and its territories. It became a federal crime to import or export a slave.[47] However, the domestic slave trade was allowed, for expansion, or for diffusion of slavery into the Louisiana Territory.[48]\\r\\nIn the winter and spring of 1786ÿ1787, twelve of the thirteen states chose a total of 74 delegates to attend the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Nineteen delegates chose not to accept election or attend the debates; for example, Patrick Henry of Virginia thought that state politics were far more interesting and important than national politics, though during the ratification controversy of 1787ÿ1788 he claimed, \\"I smelled a rat.\\" Rhode Island did not send delegates because of its politicians' suspicions of the Convention delegates' motivations. As the colony was founded by Roger Williams as a sanctuary for Baptists, Rhode Island's absence at the Convention in part explains the absence of Baptist affiliation among those who did attend. Of the 55 who did attend at some point, no more than 38 delegates showed up at one time.[49]\\r\\nMost of the Founding Fathers married and had children. Many of their spouses, like Eliza Schuyler Hamilton, Martha Washington, Abigail Adams, Sarah Livingston Jay, Dolley Madison, Mary White Morris and Catherine Alexander Duer were strong women and made significant contributions of their own to the fight for liberty.[50]\\r\\nSherman fathered the largest family: 15 children by two wives. At least nine (Bassett, Brearly, Johnson, Mason, Paterson, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Sherman, Wilson, and Wythe) married more than once. Four (Baldwin, Gilman, Jenifer, and Alexander Martin) were lifelong bachelors. Many of the delegates also had children conceived illegitimately.[51] George Washington, \\"The Father of our Country,\\"[52] had no biological descendants.\\r\\nThe National Archives and Records Administration also known as NARA, defines U.S. Founding Documents, or Charters of Freedom, as the Declaration of Independence (1776), The Constitution (1787) and the Bill of Rights (1791). These original instruments which represent the philosophy of the United States are housed in Washington, D.C. in the NARA Rotunda.[53] The Library of Congress further identifies the Articles of Confederation, also preserved at NARA, as a primary U.S. document.[54] The Articles of Confederation served as the first constitution of the United States until its replacement by the present Constitution on March 4, 1789.\\r\\nSignatories of the Continental Association (CA), Declaration of Independence (DI), Articles of Confederation (AC), and the United States Constitution (USC)):\\r\\nSubsequent events in the lives of the Founding Fathers after the adoption of the Constitution were characterized by success or failure, reflecting the abilities of these men as well as the vagaries of fate.[55] Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Madison served in highest U.S. office of President. Jay would be elected to two terms as Governor of New York.\\r\\nSeven (Fitzsimons, Gorham, Luther Martin, Mifflin, Robert Morris, Pierce, and Wilson) suffered serious financial reversals that left them in or near bankruptcy. Robert Morris spent three of the last years of his life imprisoned following bad land deals.[50] Two, Blount and Dayton, were involved in possibly treasonous activities. Yet, as they had done before the convention, most of the group continued to render public service, particularly to the new government they had helped to create.\\r\\nMany of the Founding Fathers were under 40 years old at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776: James Armistead Lafayette was 15, Marquis de Lafayette was 18, Alexander Hamilton was 19, Aaron Burr was 20, Gouverneur Morris and Betsy Ross were 24. The oldest were Benjamin Franklin, 70 and Samuel Whittemore, 81.[56]\\r\\nSecretary Charles Thomson lived to the age of 94. Johnson died at 92. John Adams lived to the age of 90. A few  Franklin, Jay, Jefferson, Madison, Hugh Williamson, and George Wythe  lived into their eighties. Approximately 16 died in their seventies, 21 in their sixties, 8 in their fifties, and 5 in their forties. Three (Alexander Hamilton, Richard Dobbs Spaight and Button Gwinnett) were killed in duels.\\r\\nFriends and political adversaries John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on the same day - July 4, 1826 [57]\\r\\nThe last remaining founders, also called the \\"Last of the Romans\\", lived well into the nineteenth century.[58]\\r\\nThe following men and women are also recognized by many as having been founders of the United States based upon their significant contributions to the formation of American nation and democracy.\\r\\nSeveral Founding Fathers were instrumental in establishing schools and societal institutions that still exist today:\\r\\nArticles and books by twenty-first century historians combined with the digitization of primary sources like handwritten letters continue to contribute to an encyclopedic body of knowledge about the Founding Fathers.\\r\\nRon Chernow won the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of George Washington. His bestselling book about Alexander Hamilton inspired the blockbuster musical of the same name.\\r\\nJoseph J. Ellis - According to Ellis, the concept of the Founding Fathers of the U.S. emerged in the 1820s as the last survivors died out. Ellis says \\"the founders\\", or \\"the fathers\\", comprised an aggregate of semi-sacred figures whose particular accomplishments and singular achievements were decidedly less important than their sheer presence as a powerful but faceless symbol of past greatness. For the generation of national leaders coming of age in the 1820s and 1830s ÿ men like Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun ÿ \\"the founders\\" represented a heroic but anonymous abstraction whose long shadow fell across all followers and whose legendary accomplishments defied comparison.\\r\\n\\"We can win no laurels in a war for independence,\\" Webster acknowledged in 1825. \\"Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them all. Nor are there places for us?... [as] the founders of states. Our fathers have filled them. But there remains to us a great duty of defence and preservation.\\"[88]\\r\\nJoanne B. Freeman Freeman's area of expertise is the life and legacy of Alexander Hamilton as well as political culture of the revolutionary and early national eras.[89][90][91] Freeman has documented the often opposing visions of the Founding Fathers as they tried to build a new framework for governance, \\"Regional distrust, personal animosity, accusation, suspicion, implication, and denouncementthis was the tenor of national politics from the outset. [92]\\r\\nAnnette Gordon-Reed is an American historian and Harvard Law School professor. She is noted for changing scholarship on Thomas Jefferson regarding his relationship with Sally Hemings and her children. She has studied the challenges facing the Founding Fathers particularly as it relates to their position and actions on slavery.

Rice also set several scoring records in the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, and was selected the game's MVP.[4] At midseason, the Hornets traded Scott Burrell to the Golden State Warriors while acquiring Ricky Pierce from the Denver Nuggets.

Since 1992, the band has consisted of Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Savage (bass, backing vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (guitars, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitars, backing vocals). This is the band's longest lasting line-up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band's strongest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their 1981 album, High 'n' Dry, was produced by Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's standout track \\"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\\" became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982. The band's next studio album, Pyromania, was released in January 1983, with \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Rock of Ages\\" as the lead singles. In the U.S., Pyromania was certified diamond (10G platinum), making Def Leppard among the most popular music groups at the time. In 2003, the album ranked number 384 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDef Leppard's fourth album Hysteria, released in 1987, topped the UK and U.S. album charts. As of 2009, it has reached beyond the success of Pyromania, having been certified 12G platinum for sales of over 12 million in the U.S. and has gone on to sell over 25 million copies worldwide.[7] The album spawned seven hit singles, including the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number one \\"Love Bites\\", alongside \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\", \\"Hysteria\\", \\"Armageddon It\\", \\"Animal\\", \\"Rocket\\", and \\"Women\\". Their next studio album, Adrenalize (the first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark), reached number one in UK and U.S. charts in 1992, and contained several hits, including \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" and \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\". Their 1993 album, Retro Active, contained the acoustic hit song \\"Two Steps Behind\\". Their greatest-hits album Vault, released in 1995, featured the UK hit \\"When Love & Hate Collide\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAs one of the world's best-selling music artists, Def Leppard have sold more than 100 million records worldwide,[8] and have two albums with RIAA diamond certification, Pyromania and Hysteria.[9] They are one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling over 10 million copies in the U.S.[10][11] The band were ranked No.?31 in VH1's \\"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\\"[12] and ranked No.?70 in \\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nRick Savage, Tony Kenning, and Pete Willis, all students at Tapton School in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, formed a band called Atomic Mass in 1977. The band originally consisted of Willis on guitar, Savage on bass guitar after briefly playing guitar, and Kenning on drums. Only 18 at the time, Joe Elliott tried out for the band as a guitarist following a chance meeting with Willis after missing a bus in November 1977.[citation needed] During his audition it was decided that he was better suited to be the lead singer. Their first gig was in the dining hall in A Block in Westfield School in Mosborough, Sheffield.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nElliott proposed the name \\"Deaf Leopard\\" which was originally a band name he thought up while writing reviews for imaginary rock bands in his English class.[15] At Kenning's suggestion, the spelling was slightly modified in order to make the name seem less like that of a punk band.[citation needed] In January 1978, Steve Clark joined the band.  According to Elliott, he successfully auditioned for the band by playing Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Free Bird\\" in its entirety.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November, just prior to recording sessions for what would be a three-song release known as The Def Leppard E.P., Kenning abruptly left the band; he would later form the band Cairo. He was replaced for those sessions by Frank Noon. By the end of the month, Rick Allen, then only 15 years old, had joined the band as its full-time drummer. Sales of the EP soared after the track \\"Getcha Rocks Off\\" was given extensive airtime by renowned BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, considered at the time to be a champion of punk rock and new wave music.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout 1979, the band developed a loyal following among British hard rock and heavy metal fans and were considered among the leaders of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. Their growing popularity led to a record deal with the major label Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US). Def Leppard's original management, MSB, a local duo consisting of Pete Martin and Frank Stuart-Brown, were fired after Martin and Joe Elliott got into a fistfight over an incident on the road. The band approached Peter Mensch of Leber-Krebs management, who had booked them on a tour of the UK supporting AC/DC. Mensch, who admitted that he had had his eye on the band, became their manager.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDef Leppard's debut album, On Through the Night, was released on 14 March 1980. Although the album hit the Top 15 in the UK,[citation needed] many early fans were turned off by the perception that the band was trying too hard to appeal to American audiences by recording songs such as \\"Hello America\\" and touring more in the US (supporting Pat Travers, AC/DC, and Ted Nugent).[citation needed] A performance at the Reading Festival in August was marred when audience members expressed their displeasure by pelting the band with beer cans and bottles filled with urine. This incident was partially blamed on a cover story in Sounds music newspaper by the journalist Geoff Barton entitled \\"Has the Leppard changed its spots?\\" accusing the band of selling out to the American market. In a documentary on the band recorded for BBC 2, Barton recalls feelings of guilt over the story and having a \\"stand-up row\\" with the band's manager, Mensch, backstage at the show.[18][19][20] In the documentary series Metal Evolution, Joe Elliott says that the media had exaggerated the event and all bands on the day had experienced the 'abuse' from the crowd.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band had by then caught the attention of AC/DC producer Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, who agreed to work on their second album, High 'n' Dry, released on 11 July 1981. Lange's meticulous approach in the studio helped them begin to define their sound. Despite the album's unimpressive sales figures, the band's video for \\"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\\" became one of the first metal videos played on MTV in 1982, bringing the band increased visibility in the U.S.[22] The band continued to use the up-and-coming music television industry to reach fans over the years with their unique videos and the extravagance of their concerts.[23]  After the album's release, European and American tours followed. The band opened for Ozzy Osbourne and Blackfoot.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nPete Willis was fired on 11 July 1982 due to excessive alcohol consumption on the job and was replaced by Phil Collen of Girl the next day. This personnel change took place during the recording of their third album, Pyromania, which was released on 20 January 1983 and also produced by Lange. The cover artwork depicted an animated picture of a huge flame emerging from the top floor of a skyscraper, with a bullseye aimed at the flame. Though many stores would not carry the album due to the cover art, the band did not change the artwork.[citation needed] The lead single, \\"Photograph\\", turned Def Leppard into a household name, supplanting Michael Jackson's \\"Beat It\\" as the most requested video clip on MTV and becoming a staple of rock radio (dominating the US Album Rock Charts for six weeks), and sparked a headline tour across the U.S.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nFueled by \\"Photograph\\" and subsequent singles \\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"Foolin'\\", Pyromania went on to sell six million copies in 1983 (more than 100,000 copies every week in that year) and only was held from the top of the US album charts by Michael Jackson's Thriller.[citation needed] With the album's massive success, Pyromania was the catalyst for the 1980s pop-metal movement.[26] In 2004, Pyromania was certified Diamond having sold over 10 million copies in the US.[27] Def Leppard's US tour in support of Pyromania began opening for Billy Squier in March and ended with a headlining performance before an audience of 55,000 at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, California in September.[citation needed] As a testament to the band's popularity at the time, a US Gallup poll in 1984 saw Def Leppard voted as favourite rock band over peers such as The Rolling Stones, AC/DC, and Journey. However, in their native England, Duran Duran secured the number one spot.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing their breakthrough, the band moved to Dublin in February 1984 for tax purposes to begin writing the follow-up to Pyromania. Mutt Lange initially joined in on the songwriting sessions but then suddenly declined to return as producer due to exhaustion. Instead, Jim Steinman (of Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell fame) was brought in.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 31 December 1984, drummer Rick Allen lost his left arm in a car crash on the A57 in the hills outside the band's home city of Sheffield. Allen was driving with his Dutch girlfriend, Miriam Barendsen, when his Corvette swerved off the road on a sharp bend and went through a drystone wall. Despite the severity of the accident, Allen was committed to continuing his role as Def Leppard's drummer, and realised that he could use his legs to do some of the drumming work previously done with his arms.[28] He then worked with Simmons to design a custom electronic drum kit.[29] The other members of the band supported Allen's recovery and never sought a replacement. Allen was placed in a separate studio to practice his new drums. After a few months, Allen gathered the band together and performed the intro to the Led Zeppelin version of \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" to showcase his progress to the band. Joe Elliott reports this as being a \\"very emotional moment.\\"  During this period, Mutt Lange returned as producer. Def Leppard brought in Jeff Rich in August 1986 to play alongside Allen during Def Leppard's warm-up mini tour of Ireland. When the band couldn't fit two drum kits on stage at a gig, he and the band realized Allen could drum alone.[30] Allen's comeback was sealed at the 1986 Monsters of Rock festival in England, with an emotionally charged ovation after his introduction by Joe Elliott.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter over three years of recording, Def Leppard's fourth album, Hysteria, was released on 3 August 1987. One of the first singles from the album, \\"Animal\\", became the band's first Top 10 hit in the UK, reaching No.?6 on the UK Singles Chart.[32] \\"Animal\\" also started their run of ten consecutive U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 singles.[33] Hysteria immediately topped the UK Album Charts in its first week of release, and has since spent 105 weeks on the chart.[32] Initial US album sales were relatively slow (compared to Pyromania) until the release of the fourth single, \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\". The song hit Number?2, and Hysteria finally reached the top of the U.S. Billboard 200 in July 1988.[34] Often regarded as the band's signature song, \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" was ranked No.?2 on VH1's \\"100 Greatest Songs of the 80s\\" in 2006.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band's UK success saw them nominated for the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Group.[36] In October 1988, the power ballad \\"Love Bites\\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[33] In January 1989, the band scored another US Top?5 hit with \\"Armageddon It\\", and by spring of 1989 the final single \\"Rocket\\" was in the Top 20.[33] Wanting to give fans something new after the massive radio and video airplay for not only the 7 singles but also the Album tracks that Radio DJs were playing off the album, the band performed \\"Tear It Down\\", a Hysteria B-side at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. Due to positive fan reaction the song was reworked for their following album Adrenalize.\\r\\n\\r\\nHysteria is one of only a handful of albums that has charted seven singles or more on the US Hot 100: \\"Women\\" (#80), \\"Animal\\" (#19), \\"Hysteria\\" (#10), \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" (#2), \\"Love Bites\\" (#1), \\"Armageddon It\\" (#3), and \\"Rocket\\" (#12).[33] It remained on the charts for three years and has sold over 25?million copies worldwide.[7] Equally successful was the accompanying 16-month tour, in which the band performed in the round. This concept proved wildly popular with fans (as seen in the videos for \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" and \\"Armageddon It\\") and was used again for the Adrenalize tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 1989 Brit Awards held at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Def Leppard were again a nominee for Best British Group, and the band performed \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" at the ceremony.[37][38] At the 1989 American Music Awards, Def Leppard won Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Artist, as well as Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Album (for Hysteria).[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Hysteria, the band quickly set out to work on their fifth album, hoping to avoid another lengthy gap. Steve Clark's alcoholism worsened to the point that he was constantly in and out of rehab. Recording sessions suffered from this distraction, and in mid-1990, Clark was granted a six-month leave of absence from the band. Clark died from a mix of prescription drugs and alcohol on 8 January 1991, in his London home.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remaining band members decided to carry on and recorded the album as a four-piece, with Collen mimicking Clark's style on his intended guitar parts.  Def Leppard's fifth album, Adrenalize, was finally released on 31 March 1992. The album simultaneously entered at number one on both the UK and US album charts, staying on the latter for 5 weeks.[34][41] The first single, \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", was an instant smash hit, and the band performed the song at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards where it was nominated for Best Video of the Year.[42] In April 1992, Def Leppard appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium, London, performing a three-song set of \\"Animal\\", \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" and Queen's \\"Now I'm Here\\" with guitarist Brian May.[43] Joe Elliott later performed \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" with the remaining members of Queen and Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a period between late 1991 and early 1992, auditions for another guitarist commenced. Among the guitarists who auditioned included Adrian Smith, John Sykes, and Gary Hoey. Ultimately, the band chose Vivian Campbell in February 1992, formerly of Dio and Whitesnake. Another world tour followed but the band's fortunes began to be affected by the rise of alternative rock, including grunge.  Amidst the increasing popularity of alternative rock, the band decided to balance their original image as rebellious rock stars with a slightly friendlier energy, combining heavy metal with melodies and hooks more reminiscent of pop music.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nA collection of b-sides and unreleased tracks recorded between 1984 and 1993, called Retro Active, was released in October 1993, preceded by the success of \\"Two Steps Behind\\" (from the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Last Action Hero). Another single, \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\", hit the Top?5 in Canada, becoming one of their biggest hits there. Retro Active has sold 3?million copies worldwide to date. Two years later, Def Leppard issued their first greatest hits collection, Vault: Def Leppard Greatest Hits (1980ÿ1995), which reached number 3 in the UK, and sold over 5?million copies in the US.[32][47] Alternate track listings of the album were issued for North America, the UK, and Japan. The compilation included a new track, the power ballad \\"When Love & Hate Collide\\", which became their biggest ever hit in the UK, hitting No.?2 on the UK Singles Chart.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 October 1995, the band entered the Guinness Book of World Records by performing three concerts on three continents in one day (Tangiers, Morocco; London, England; and Vancouver, Canada).[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nSlang, released in May 1996, marked a drastic musical departure for the band by featuring darker lyrics and a stripped-down alternative rock edge. The band rehearsed and played the songs together in the studio instead of recording parts separately, resulting in a much more live-sounding album.[50] The US audience reception for Slang and its subsequent tour was a major dropoff from a decade earlier, but Q Magazine nonetheless listed Slang as one of their Top Ten Albums of 1996.[51] This album was the first recorded performance of Rick Allen playing a semi-acoustic drum kit since his accident, and not his electronic set as was first used with Hysteria.\\r\\n\\r\\nVH1 revived the band's fortunes in the US in 1998 by featuring them on one of the first episodes of Behind the Music. Reruns of the episode yielded some of the series' highest ratings and brought the band's music back into the public consciousness (following years of burial by the alternative rock climate). The episode was even parodied on Saturday Night Live. In an effort to capitalise on this new momentum, Def Leppard returned to its classic sound with the 1999 album Euphoria. The first single, \\"Promises\\", reunited the band with Mutt Lange and hit the US Mainstream Rock charts at No.?1 for 3 weeks. The album was certified gold in the US and Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 September 2000, Def Leppard were inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard by their friend Brian May of Queen. In 2001, VH1 produced and aired Hysteria - The Def Leppard Story, a biopic that included Anthony Michael Hall as Mutt Lange and Amber Valletta as Lorelei Shellist (Steve Clark's girlfriend). The docudrama covered the band's history between 1977 through 1986, recounting the trials and triumphs of Rick Allen and Steve Clark. 18 July broadcast still produced some of the channel's highest-ever ratings and is available on DVD.\\r\\n\\r\\nDef Leppard's tenth album, X, saw the band's musical direction moving more towards pop and further away from the band's hard rock roots. X quickly disappeared from the charts, ultimately becoming the band's least successful release. However, the accompanying tour played to the band's strongest audiences since Adrenalize.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn expanded and updated best-of collection, Best Of, was released internationally in October 2004. The North America-only version, Rock of Ages ÿ The Definitive Collection, was released the following May. Def Leppard participated at the Live 8 show in Philadelphia and toured in the summer with Bryan Adams. In 2005, the band left their longtime management team, Q-Prime, and signed with HK Management.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 May 2006, Def Leppard released an all-covers album titled Yeah!. The disc pays homage to classic rock songs of their childhood, originally recorded by Blondie, The Kinks, Sweet, ELO, and Badfinger among others. It debuted at No.?16 in the US, their tenth consecutive Top?20 album.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band, along with Queen, Kiss, and Judas Priest, were the inaugural inductees of VH1 Rock Honors on 31 May 2006.[52] During the show, The All-American Rejects paid homage to the band with a cover of \\"Photograph\\". Soon afterwards, they embarked on a US tour with Journey. That October, Hysteria was re-released in a two-disc deluxe edition format, which combined the original remastered album with b-sides, remixes, and bonus tracks from single releases. Def Leppard began their \\"Downstage Thrust Tour\\", on 27 June, which took them across the US and into Canada. Support bands were Foreigner and Styx.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 April 2008, Def Leppard released their first album of new studio material in six years, Songs from the Sparkle Lounge. The album debuted at No.?5 on the Billboard 200 in the US. The first single was entitled \\"Nine Lives\\" and featured country singer Tim McGraw, who co-wrote the song with Joe Elliott, Phil Collen, and Rick Savage.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tour in support of the album began on 27 March 2008 in Greensboro, North Carolina,[53] with Styx and REO Speedwagon joining the band on US dates. The band also played several European rock festivals. An arena tour of the UK took place in June in which the band co-headlined with Whitesnake and was supported by US southern rockers Black Stone Cherry. The band then returned to Europe before coming back for a second leg of the UK tour in June. The first of these dates was at the Glasgow SECC on 17 June. Again they were joined by Whitesnake; however, hard rock band Thunder supported at some of these shows. Black Stone Cherry continued to support most of the dates, including some of the Thunder ones. Six shows which were cancelled during the USA/Canada leg of their world tour due to illnesses affecting Joe Elliott and Phil Collen would be rescheduled and played in August of that year. On 11 June, Def Leppard announced further dates for their 2008 World Tour. The extension saw them visit Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Whitesnake continued to support Def Leppard for their Indian and Japanese dates. Def Leppard toured 41 US cities plus Toronto, Canada, during mid-2009 with Poison and Cheap Trick and also played the Download Festival with Whitesnake and ZZ Top.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2008, Def Leppard played with country star Taylor Swift in a taped show in Nashville, Tennessee, in a show called CMT Crossroads: Taylor Swift and Def Leppard. This was released as a DVD on 16 June 2009 exclusively at Wal-Mart.[54] The release was the best-selling DVD of week, and the 10th best selling Wal-Mart music release.[55] A fan of the band since childhood, Taylor Swift chose Def Leppard to perform together for the show, and their crossover performance of \\"Photograph\\" was up for both Performance of the Year and Wide Open Country Video of the Year at the CMT Music Awards in 2009.[54] Taylor Swift said of the performance, \\"Performing with Def Leppard was awesome! They are the coolest guys on the planet! It was the coolest thing in the world to have my band on stage with them...It was the most amazing feeling in the world...\\"[56] Joe Elliott from Def Leppard said, \\"What an absolute pleasure it was to work with Taylor and her band who are a great set of musicians. Myself and Taylor blended really well together, I think, and everybody, both bands and the crowd, had a great time. I'm really glad we had the opportunity to do this.\\"[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2009 the band announced that they would be cancelling the last leg of the 2009 North American tour, a total of 23 shows. The band cited, \\"unforeseen personal matters\\", as the reason for the cancellations.[58] At the time, the band denied rumours about a breakup, saying, \\"We're not splitting. Not at all. We often joke, what else would we do? You just can't imagine doing anything else.\\"[58][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter taking a year off from touring in 2010, the band announced on 22 February 2011 that they would be releasing their first live album in the summer. Mirror Ball ÿ Live & More, a two-disc live album, with three new studio tracks, was released in parts of Europe on 3 June, the rest of Europe on 6 June, and on 7 June in the US; it was announced at the same time that Def Leppard would perform at the Download Festival on 10 June 2011.[60] Of the three new studio tracks, two were released as singles, the first single being \\"Undefeated\\" released in April 2011, followed by \\"It's All About Believin'\\" released in May 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nDef Leppard embarked on a two-month U.S. tour in the summer of 2011, with Heart.,[61] as well as another seven shows in Australia in October with The Choirboys and Heart,[62] two shows in Japan in November,[63] and six shows in the United Kingdom in December with Steel Panther and M?tley Cre.[64] The following year, they then toured with Poison and Lita Ford in the US during the summer of 2012 from 20 June through 15 September, dubbed the \\"Rock Of Ages 2012 Tour\\".[65][66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year after, Def Leppard played an eleven show residency at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada from 22 March through 13 April 2013. The residency, referred to as Viva! Hysteria, featured a two part show, with the first half featuring Def Leppard opening for themselves, under the alias \\"Ded Flatbird\\", (jokingly called the best Def Leppard cover band in the world), when they would then play songs they very rarely play live, going all the way back to \\"Good Morning Freedom\\", a b-side from the single \\"Hello America\\" released in February 1980, an era usually left untouched by the band. The opening set varied each night, from playing the best hits from albums like On Through the Night, Slang, and Euphoria, to being the entire first half of High 'n' Dry. The second half, and \\"main event\\" was Def Leppard, as themselves playing their best-selling album, Hysteria, from start to finish. A live album, also titled Viva! Hysteria was released on 22 October 2013. This was the first time the band has played an album live from start to finish.[67][68] The band has re-recorded several hits and even the entire album Hysteria in an effort to circumvent their record label from future royalties, though of these re-recordings, only \\"Rock Of Ages\\", \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\", and \\"Hysteria\\" have been released.[69][70][71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2013, Vivian Campbell announced that he had developed Hodgkin's lymphoma, a malignant form of cancer that affects the Reed-Sternberg cells, located in the lymph nodes.[72] He continued performing with Def Leppard, and no shows were cancelled or rescheduled. The sole idea of cancelling any shows and not doing anything disgusted Campbell, believing performing would be the best way to remain optimistic.[73] In November 2013, he announced he was in remission. However, the cancer has since reemerged, and he is now receiving chemotherapy once again. Should the cancer once again enter remission, he will undergo a stem-cell transplant.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 February 2014, the band released a remastered deluxe edition of their 1996 album Slang after much delay. The album, still coveted by many loyal fans of the band, now features 30 tracks including demos, B-sides, and unreleased material.[74] From 23 June 2014 to 31 August 2014, Def Leppard and Kiss toured 42 cities, with a dollar per ticket donated to such military charities as Wounded Warrior Project.[75] Def Leppard contributed one song Helen Wheels to the Paul McCartney tribute album The Art of McCartney released on 18 November 2014. Joe Elliott also contributed another track Hi, Hi, Hi.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt certain recent points in time, the band had projects, such as a cartoon and a documentary in development. However, these projects seem to be shelved indefinitely. The band had originally planned to do another residency in Las Vegas, this time in honour of Pyromania (called Viva! Pyromania), but due to the \\"Heroes 2014\\" tour with Kiss, and the recording of their new studio album, the project had been pushed back indefinitely.[76][77] The new album was originally planned to be an EP, but the set-list increased to 15 songs by June 2014.[78]  The album was released on October 30, 2015 with a tour following.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2014, the band announced a 13-date Canadian tour in April and May 2015.[80] This was followed in February 2015 with the announcement of a 2015 US summer tour with Styx and Tesla from June to October 2015.[81] The tour was then extended to include dates in Japan and Australia throughout November, and a tour of the UK and Ireland with Whitesnake in December. Def Leppard then returned to North America with Styx and Tesla in early 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eleventh studio album, titled Def Leppard, was recorded in 2014 and 2015, and released on 30 October 2015.[82] The band released the lead single from their self-titled album on 15 September 2015, titled \\"Let's Go\\", with a music video for the song being released on 30 October.[83] The 14 track album debuted at number 10 in the U.S. and number 11 in the UK.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the break following their 2015 tour, Def Leppard led the Hysteria on the High Seas concert cruise aboard the MSC Divina in January 2016. Joe Elliott became ill with laryngitis on the night of their cruise performance.[85] This led to the band performing without Elliott for the first time in their history. Vivian Campbell and Phil Collen sang lead vocals on two songs of the shortened seven song set in addition to two songs with vocals by Andrew Freeman and two more with Eric Martin and Kip Winger.[85] in addition to this, Campbell and Freeman's Last in Line bandmate Jimmy Bain, former bassist of Dio died of lung cancer aboard the ship the same night, causing Last in Line to cancel their show the following day.[86] Back on land, Elliott struggled through the first concert of the 2016 tour, resulting in Tesla's Jeff Keith joining Elliott on lead. The following day's concert was also postponed \\"due to illness\\", with Rick Allen reporting on Twitter \\"The Doctor basically said that if Joe continues to sing without resting his throat for a month he might do permanent damage..\\"[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy July 2016, the band were performing regularly again and intended to complete 48 dates.[88] When the tour stopped at DTE Energy Music Theatre in Clarkston, Michigan on 15 July, the show was recorded for future release. On 10 February 2017, the band released And There Will be a Next Time... Live from Detroit, a double live album and concert video.[89] In August 2017 the band celebrated the 30th anniversary of Hysteria by releasing a collectors edition box. The singles were also re-released on vinyl.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2018, Def Leppard announced it would embark on a 58 date North American tour with Journey.[91] In addition, the group's discography was made available for streaming and digital download after a deal was quietly reached between the band and Universal Music Group.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nDef Leppard's music is a mixture of hard rock, AOR, pop and heavy metal elements, with its multi-layered, harmonic vocals and its melodic guitar riffs. However, even though they were often considered one of the top bands of the new wave of British heavy metal movement of the late 1970s, in the mid-1980s the band were associated with the growing glam metal scene, mainly due to their mainstream success and glossy production.[94] Pyromania has been cited as the catalyst for the 1980s pop-metal movement.[26] Def Leppard, however, expressed their dislike of the \\"glam metal\\" label, as they thought it did not accurately describe their look or musical style.[95] By the release of the Hysteria album, the band had developed a distinctive sound featuring electronic drums and effects-laden guitar sounds overlaid with a multi-layered wall of husky, harmonised vocals. Def Leppard has been cited as an influence by a wide range of musical acts, from heavy metal and thrash metal bands such as Slayer,[96] Pantera,[97] and Metallica[98] as part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement as well as by popular contemporary artists Matt Nathanson[99] and Taylor Swift.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Pyromania and Hysteria both certified Diamond by the RIAA, Def Leppard are one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling over 10?million copies each in the US, alongside the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Van Halen.[11] Both Pyromania and Hysteria feature in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[6][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nDef Leppard was among the most successful of the new wave of British heavy metal bands in the early 1980s. They combined the raw power of metal with a pop emphasis on melody, catchy hooks and vocal harmonies that, particularly later on, contrasted sharply with harsher contemporary metal and punk bands.[101] Their early album On Through the Night (1980) appealed to metal fans and influenced the likes of Dimebag Darrell of Pantera[97] and Jeff Hanneman of Slayer.[96] Their hugely popular later albums, such as Hysteria (1987), appeared irregular due to their perfectionism in the studio, but appealed to a broad range of music fans.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the band received a Sheffield Legends plaque in their hometown of Sheffield, England.[102] Despite their huge commercial success, Elliott has said in an interview that he feels the band does not receive its fair share of respect from the British music press and he claimed the band had been barred from the BBC's Later with Jools Holland series because they were \\"not cool enough\\".[103]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPhil Collen played guitar, uncredited, on Sam Kinison's \\"Wild Thing\\" from 1988. The video featured members of bands such as Poison, Bon Jovi, M?tley Cre, Guns N' Roses, Ratt, and Aerosmith. Collen also produced and played on the 1991 album On The Edge from Australian band BB Steal.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe Elliott sang lead vocals on two tracks on Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood's 1992 solo album, Slide on This. His then-wife Karla appeared in the videos for \\"Always Wanted More\\" and \\"Somebody Else Might\\". Various members of Def Leppard have played on tribute records for Jeff Beck, AC/DC and Alice Cooper.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fan of his local football club Sheffield United F.C., Elliott performed on two tracks to the soundtrack of the 1996 Sheffield-set motion picture, When Saturday Comes (featuring fellow Sheffield native Sean Bean as a star football player), the title track and an instrumental, \\"Jimmy's Theme\\".[104] Elliott sang and co-wrote the opening track, \\"Don't Look Down\\" on Mick Ronson's farewell album Heaven and Hull.  A promotional video was issued for the song as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nCybernauts was a side project consisting of Elliott and Collen teamed with members of The Spiders From Mars (David Bowie's former band), minus the late Mick Ronson. The group played several shows, covering Bowie's Ziggy Stardust-era songs and released one internet only album (since deleted).\\r\\n\\r\\nVivian Campbell has played with two side bands in recent years, Clock and the Riverdogs, and recorded a solo album, Two Sides of If, released in 2005. Campbell toured with Thin Lizzy in early 2011 before joining Def Leppard on their latest tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollen sings lead vocals and plays guitar in a side band called Man Raze with Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook and former Girl bandmate Simon Laffy. They released their debut album Surreal in 2008 and a second album, PunkFunkRootsRock, in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe Elliott founded and fronts the band Down 'n' Outz with members of The Quireboys. The band plays covers of Mott the Hoople and related artists such as British Lions and Ian Hunter. They have released two studio albums of covers and one live album since their incarnation in 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the death of Ronnie James Dio, Vivian Campbell reunited with the rest of the original Dio lineup with vocalist Andrew Freeman to form Last in Line. The band pays tribute to Dio by playing songs from their original tenure in the band and released an album titled Heavy Crown in February 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoe Elliott, along with various other musicians including Glenn Hughes, Duff McKagan, Sebastian Bach, Matt Sorum, Gilby Clarke and Steve Stevens formed a supergroup called Kings of Chaos, whose catalogue consists of songs by Deep Purple, Def Leppard, Guns N' Roses and others. In 2012, Kings of Chaos recorded their version of Deep Purple's classic, \\"Never Before\\" featuring Elliott singing lead vocals. Kings of Chaos played Stone Fest in Australia along with a few dates in South America in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhil Collen formed a blues project by the name of Delta Deep with vocalist Debbi Blackwell Cook which released an eponymous debut in 2015.[105]","input":"When did def leppard release their first album?"},{"output":"The People's Choice","context":"The People's Choice is an American television sitcom that aired on NBC from 1955 to 1958. It was primarily sponsored by The Borden Company.\\r\\nIt stars Jackie Cooper as Socrates \\"Sock\\" Miller, who is a former Marine and a young politician living in fictitious New City, California. Sock has a basset hound named \\"Cleo\\", whose thoughts (voiced by Mary Jane Croft), baleful observations of Sock's dilemmas, are recorded on the soundtrack for the viewers' amusement. The real name of the dog that played Cleo was \\"Bernadette\\". Much of Cleo's dialog consists of wisecracks. The popularity of the basset hound breed increased markedly with the run of the show.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first season, Sock is an ornithologist and a city council member, who is living in a trailer park with his Aunt Gus (Margaret Irving). Sock is dating Mandy Peoples (Patricia Breslin), the daughter of the mayor (Paul Maxey), who does not entirely approve of the relationship, but he gradually warms to Sock.\\r\\nLater, Sock takes courses (though he is not in law school) to pass the California bar exam in order to become an attorney, so that he can then afford to marry Mandy. In the first season finale, Sock suddenly proposes to Mandy and wants to elope. He is afraid the mayor will want to stage a big wedding, and they won't be able to get married for many months. The couple drives to Nevada for a quickie wedding, intending to return in time for Sock to take his bar exam. On the way back, they are arrested for a traffic violation, and must spend the night in jail. This causes Sock to miss the bar exam. Sock wants to be independent of his father-in-law; so the couple agrees to keep their marriage a secret from the mayor until Sock gets his law license.\\r\\nMost episodes in the second season are about Sock and Mandy trying to be together (as much as this could be depicted in the 1950s), while keeping the mayor from finding out that they are married. At some point during the season, Aunt Gus and the mayor get married, and she learns that Sock and Mandy are married and agrees to keep their secret from the mayor. By the end of the season, Sock has passed the bar, and their marriage is out in the open. Sock's scheming Marine buddy, Rollo \\"The Hex\\" Hexley (Dick Wesson), moved in with Sock during the second season and appeared in twenty-seven episodes as well as the original 1955 pilot.[1]\\r\\nIn the third season, Sock manages a residential real estate development called \\"Barkerville Estates.\\" They still return to New City often enough for Mayor Peoples and Aunt Gus to appear regularly.\\r\\nThe series was created and co-produced by Irving Brecher, who was also the creator of the 1949 sitcom, The Life of Riley. Although The People's Choice never made the top 30 programs, its ratings were respectable enough to warrant a three-year run on NBC. The show later became popular in syndication.\\r\\nIn its first season, The People's Choice aired opposite Stop the Music, which concluded its long run on ABC.\\r\\nFrom The People's Choice, Cleo the talking dog spawned the idea of a talking baby in the 1960-1961 NBC sitcom, Happy starring Ronnie Burns and Yvonne Lime Fedderson, who had also guest starred on The People's Choice.\\r\\nIn Spanish the show was known as \\"Cleo y yo\\".","input":"What tv show had a dog named cleo?"},{"output":"Leon Moisseiff","context":"The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6?km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the American city of San Francisco, California ÿ the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula ÿ to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[7]\\r\\nThe Frommer's travel guide describes the Golden Gate Bridge as \\"possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world.\\"[8][9] At the time of its opening in 1937, it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world, with a main span of 4,200 feet (1,280?m) and a total height of 746 feet (227?m).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the bridge was built, the only practical short route between San Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat across a section of San Francisco Bay. A ferry service began as early as 1820, with a regularly scheduled service beginning in the 1840s for the purpose of transporting water to San Francisco.[10]\\r\\nThe Sausalito Land and Ferry Company service, launched in 1867, eventually became the Golden Gate Ferry Company, a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the largest ferry operation in the world by the late 1920s.[10][11] Once for railroad passengers and customers only, Southern Pacific's automobile ferries became very profitable and important to the regional economy.[12] The ferry crossing between the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Sausalito in Marin County took approximately 20 minutes and cost US$1.00 per vehicle, a price later reduced to compete with the new bridge.[13] The trip from the San Francisco Ferry Building took 27 minutes.\\r\\nMany wanted to build a bridge to connect San Francisco to Marin County. San Francisco was the largest American city still served primarily by ferry boats. Because it did not have a permanent link with communities around the bay, the city's growth rate was below the national average.[14] Many experts said that a bridge could not be built across the 6,700?ft (2,042?m) strait, which had strong, swirling tides and currents, with water 372?ft (113?m) deep[15] at the center of the channel, and frequent strong winds. Experts said that ferocious winds and blinding fogs would prevent construction and operation.[14]\\r\\nAlthough the idea of a bridge spanning the Golden Gate was not new, the proposal that eventually took hold was made in a 1916 San Francisco Bulletin article by former engineering student James Wilkins.[16] San Francisco's City Engineer estimated the cost at $100 million, which would have been $2.12 billion in 2009, and impractical for the time. He asked bridge engineers whether it could be built for less.[10] One who responded, Joseph Strauss, was an ambitious engineer and poet who had, for his graduate thesis, designed a 55-mile-long (89?km) railroad bridge across the Bering Strait.[17] At the time, Strauss had completed some 400 drawbridgesmost of which were inlandand nothing on the scale of the new project.[3] Strauss's initial drawings[16] were for a massive cantilever on each side of the strait, connected by a central suspension segment, which Strauss promised could be built for $17?million.[10]\\r\\nLocal authorities agreed to proceed only on the assurance that Strauss would alter the design and accept input from several consulting project experts.[citation needed] A suspension-bridge design was considered the most practical, because of recent advances in metallurgy.[10]\\r\\nStrauss spent more than a decade drumming up support in Northern California.[18] The bridge faced opposition, including litigation, from many sources. The Department of War was concerned that the bridge would interfere with ship traffic. The navy feared that a ship collision or sabotage to the bridge could block the entrance to one of its main harbors. Unions demanded guarantees that local workers would be favored for construction jobs. Southern Pacific Railroad, one of the most powerful business interests in California, opposed the bridge as competition to its ferry fleet and filed a lawsuit against the project, leading to a mass boycott of the ferry service.[10]\\r\\nIn May 1924, Colonel Herbert Deakyne held the second hearing on the Bridge on behalf of the Secretary of War in a request to use federal land for construction. Deakyne, on behalf of the Secretary of War, approved the transfer of land needed for the bridge structure and leading roads to the \\"Bridging the Golden Gate Association\\" and both San Francisco County and Marin County, pending further bridge plans by Strauss.[19] Another ally was the fledgling automobile industry, which supported the development of roads and bridges to increase demand for automobiles.[13]\\r\\nThe bridge's name was first used when the project was initially discussed in 1917 by M.M. O'Shaughnessy, city engineer of San Francisco, and Strauss. The name became official with the passage of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District Act by the state legislature in 1923, creating a special district to design, build and finance the bridge.[20] San Francisco and most of the counties along the North Coast of California joined the Golden Gate Bridge District, with the exception being Humboldt County, whose residents opposed the bridge's construction and the traffic it would generate.[21]\\r\\nStrauss was chief engineer in charge of overall design and construction of the bridge project.[14] However, because he had little understanding or experience with cable-suspension designs,[22] responsibility for much of the engineering and architecture fell on other experts. Strauss's initial design proposal (two double cantilever spans linked by a central suspension segment) was unacceptable from a visual standpoint. The final graceful suspension design was conceived and championed by Leon Moisseiff, the engineer of the Manhattan Bridge in New York City.[23]\\r\\nIrving Morrow, a relatively unknown residential architect, designed the overall shape of the bridge towers, the lighting scheme, and Art Deco elements, such as the tower decorations, streetlights, railing, and walkways. The famous International Orange color was originally used as a sealant for the bridge.[24] The US Navy had wanted it to be painted with black and yellow stripes to ensure visibility by passing ships.[14]\\r\\nSenior engineer Charles Alton Ellis, collaborating remotely with Moisseiff, was the principal engineer of the project.[25] Moisseiff produced the basic structural design, introducing his \\"deflection theory\\" by which a thin, flexible roadway would flex in the wind, greatly reducing stress by transmitting forces via suspension cables to the bridge towers.[25] Although the Golden Gate Bridge design has proved sound, a later Moisseiff design, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, collapsed in a strong windstorm soon after it was completed, because of an unexpected aeroelastic flutter.[26] Ellis was also tasked with designing a \\"bridge within a bridge\\" in the southern abutment, to avoid the need to demolish Fort Point, a preÿCivil War masonry fortification viewed, even then, as worthy of historic preservation. He penned a graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the bridge's southern anchorage.[27]\\r\\nEllis was a Greek scholar and mathematician who at one time was a University of Illinois professor of engineering despite having no engineering degree. He eventually earned a degree in civil engineering from the University of Illinois prior to designing the Golden Gate Bridge and spent the last twelve years of his career as a professor at Purdue University. He became an expert in structural design, writing the standard textbook of the time.[28] Ellis did much of the technical and theoretical work that built the bridge, but he received none of the credit in his lifetime. In November 1931, Strauss fired Ellis and replaced him with a former subordinate, Clifford Paine, ostensibly for wasting too much money sending telegrams back and forth to Moisseiff.[28] Ellis, obsessed with the project and unable to find work elsewhere during the Depression, continued working 70 hours per week on an unpaid basis, eventually turning in ten volumes of hand calculations.[28]\\r\\nWith an eye toward self-promotion and posterity, Strauss downplayed the contributions of his collaborators who, despite receiving little recognition or compensation,[22] are largely responsible for the final form of the bridge. He succeeded in having himself credited as the person most responsible for the design and vision of the bridge.[28] Only much later were the contributions of the others on the design team properly appreciated.[28] In May 2007, the Golden Gate Bridge District issued a formal report on 70 years of stewardship of the famous bridge and decided to give Ellis major credit for the design of the bridge.\\r\\nThe Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District, authorized by an act of the California Legislature, was incorporated in 1928 as the official entity to design, construct, and finance the Golden Gate Bridge.[14] However, after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the District was unable to raise the construction funds, so it lobbied for a $30?million bond measure. The bonds were approved in November 1930,[17] by votes in the counties affected by the bridge.[29] The construction budget at the time of approval was $27?million. However, the District was unable to sell the bonds until 1932, when Amadeo Giannini, the founder of San Franciscoÿbased Bank of America, agreed on behalf of his bank to buy the entire issue in order to help the local economy.[10]\\r\\nConstruction began on January 5, 1933.[10] The project cost more than $35?million,[30] ($493?million in 2016 dollars[31]) completing ahead of schedule and $1.3 million under budget.[32] The Golden Gate Bridge construction project was carried out by the McClintic-Marshall Construction Co., a subsidiary of Bethlehem Steel Corporation founded by Howard H. McClintic and Charles D. Marshall, both of Lehigh University.\\r\\nStrauss remained head of the project, overseeing day-to-day construction and making some groundbreaking contributions. A graduate of the University of Cincinnati, he placed a brick from his alma mater's demolished McMicken Hall in the south anchorage before the concrete was poured. He innovated the use of movable safety netting beneath the construction site, which saved the lives of many otherwise-unprotected ironworkers. Of eleven men killed from falls during construction, ten were killed on February 17, 1937, when the bridge was near completion when the net failed under the stress of a scaffold that had fallen.[33] The workers' platform that was attached to a rolling hanger on a track collapsed when the bolts that were connected to the track were too small and the amount of weight was too great to bear. The platform fell into the safety net, but was too heavy and the net gave way. Two out of the twelve workers survived the 200-foot (61?m) fall into the icy waters, including the 37-year-old foreman, Slim Lambert. Nineteen others who were saved by the net over the course of construction became members of their Half Way to Hell Club.[34]\\r\\nThe project was finished and opened May 27, 1937. The Bridge Round House diner was then included in the southeastern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, adjacent to the tourist plaza which was renovated in 2012.[35] The Bridge Round House, an Art Deco design by Alfred Finnila completed in 1938, has been popular throughout the years as a starting point for various commercial tours of the bridge and an unofficial gift shop.[36] The diner was renovated in 2012[35] and the gift shop was then removed as a new, official gift shop has been included in the adjacent plaza.[36]\\r\\nDuring the bridge work, the Assistant Civil Engineer of California Alfred Finnila had overseen the entire iron work of the bridge as well as half of the bridge's road work.[37] With the death of Jack Balestreri in April 2012, all workers involved in the original construction are now deceased.\\r\\nThe bridge-opening celebration began on May 27, 1937 and lasted for one week. The day before vehicle traffic was allowed, 200,000 people crossed either on foot or on roller skates.[10] On opening day, Mayor Angelo Rossi and other officials rode the ferry to Marin, then crossed the bridge in a motorcade past three ceremonial \\"barriers\\", the last a blockade of beauty queens who required Joseph Strauss to present the bridge to the Highway District before allowing him to pass. An official song, \\"There's a Silver Moon on the Golden Gate\\", was chosen to commemorate the event. Strauss wrote a poem that is now on the Golden Gate Bridge entitled \\"The Mighty Task is Done.\\" The next day, President Roosevelt pushed a button in Washington, D.C. signaling the official start of vehicle traffic over the Bridge at noon. As the celebration got out of hand there was a small riot in the uptown Polk Gulch area. Weeks of civil and cultural activities called \\"the Fiesta\\" followed. A statue of Strauss was moved in 1955 to a site near the bridge.[16]\\r\\nIn May 1987, as part of the 50th anniversary celebration, the Golden Gate Bridge district again closed the bridge to automobile traffic and allowed pedestrians to cross the bridge. However, this celebration attracted 750,000 to 1,000,000 people, and ineffective crowd control meant the bridge became congested with roughly 300,000 people, causing the center span of the bridge to flatten out under the weight.[38] Although the bridge is designed to flex in that way under heavy loads, and was estimated not to have exceeded 40% of the yielding stress of the suspension cables,[39] bridge officials stated that uncontrolled pedestrian access was not being considered as part of the 75th anniversary on Sunday, May 27, 2012,[40][41][42] because of the additional law enforcement costs required \\"since 9/11\\".[43]\\r\\nA pedestrian poses at the old railing on opening day, 1937\\r\\nOpening of the Golden Gate Bridge\\r\\nOfficial invitation to the opening of the bridge. This copy was sent to the City of Seattle\\r\\nUntil 1964, the Golden Gate Bridge had the longest suspension bridge main span in the world, at 4,200 feet (1,300?m). Since 1964 its main span length has been surpassed by ten bridges; it now has the second-longest main span in the United States, after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. The total length of the Golden Gate Bridge from abutment to abutment is 8,981 feet (2,737?m).[44]\\r\\nThe Golden Gate Bridge's clearance above high water averages 220 feet (67?m) while its towers, at 746 feet (227?m) above the water,[44] were the world's tallest on a suspension bridge until 1993 when it was surpassed by the Mezcala Bridge, in Mexico.\\r\\nThe weight of the roadway is hung from 250 pairs of vertical suspender ropes, which are attached to two main cables. The main cables pass over the two main towers and are fixed in concrete at each end. Each cable is made of 27,572 strands of wire. The total length of galvanized steel wire used to fabricate both main cables is estimated to be 80,000 miles (130,000?km).[44]\\r\\nThe bridge has approximately 1,200,000 total rivets.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe color of the bridge is officially an orange vermilion called international orange.[45] The color was selected by consulting architect Irving Morrow[46] because it complements the natural surroundings and enhances the bridge's visibility in fog. Aesthetics was the foremost reason why the first design of Joseph Strauss was rejected. Upon re-submission of his bridge construction plan, he added details, such as lighting, to outline the bridge's cables and towers.[47] In 1999, it was ranked fifth on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.\\r\\nThe bridge was originally painted with red lead primer and a lead-based topcoat, which was touched up as required. In the mid-1960s, a program was started to improve corrosion protection by stripping the original paint and repainting the bridge with zinc silicate primer and vinyl topcoats.[48][45] Since 1990, acrylic topcoats have been used instead for air-quality reasons. The program was completed in 1995 and it is now maintained by 38 painters who touch up the paintwork where it becomes seriously corroded.[49]\\r\\nA view of the Golden Gate Bridge from the Marin Headlands on a foggy morning at sunrise\\r\\nView of the northern tower of the bridge\\r\\nMost maps and signage mark the bridge as part of the concurrency between U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1. Although part of the National Highway System, the bridge is not officially part of California's Highway System.[50] For example, under the California Streets and Highways Code  401, Route 101 ends at \\"the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge\\" and then resumes at \\"a point in Marin County opposite San Francisco\\". The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District has jurisdiction over the segment of highway that crosses the bridge instead of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).\\r\\nThe movable median barrier between the lanes is moved several times daily to conform to traffic patterns. On weekday mornings, traffic flows mostly southbound into the city, so four of the six lanes run southbound. Conversely, on weekday afternoons, four lanes run northbound. During off-peak periods and weekends, traffic is split with three lanes in each direction.[51]\\r\\nFrom 1968 to 2015, opposing traffic was separated by small, plastic pylons, and during that time, there were 16 fatalities resulting from 128 head-on collisions.[52] To improve safety, the speed limit on the Golden Gate Bridge was reduced from 50 to 45?mph (80 to 72?km/h) on October 1, 1983.[53] Although there had been discussion concerning the installation of a movable barrier since the 1980s, only in March 2005 did the Bridge Board of Directors commit to finding funding to complete the $2?million study required prior to the installation of a movable median barrier.[52] Installation of the resulting barrier was completed on January 11, 2015, following a closure of 45.5 hours to private vehicle traffic, the longest in the bridge's history. The new barrier system, including the zipper trucks, cost approximately $30.3 million to purchase and install.[52][54]\\r\\nThe bridge is popular with pedestrians and bicyclists, and was built with walkways on either side of the six vehicle traffic lanes. Initially, they were separated from the traffic lanes by only a metal curb, but railings between the walkways and the traffic lanes were added in 2003, primarily as a measure to prevent bicyclists from falling into the roadway.[55]\\r\\nThe main walkway is on the eastern side, and is open for use by both pedestrians and bicycles in the morning to mid-afternoon during weekdays (5 am to 3:30?pm), and to pedestrians only for the remaining daylight hours (until 6?pm, or 9?pm during DST). The eastern walkway is reserved for pedestrians on weekends (5 am to 6?pm, or 9?pm during DST), and is open exclusively to bicyclists in the evening and overnight, when it is closed to pedestrians. The western walkway is open only for bicyclists and only during the hours when they are not allowed on the eastern walkway.[56]\\r\\nBus service across the bridge is provided by two public transportation agencies: San Francisco Muni and Golden Gate Transit. Muni offers Saturday and Sunday service on the Marin Headlands Express bus line, and Golden Gate Transit runs numerous bus lines throughout the week.[57][58] The southern end of the bridge, near the toll plaza and parking lot, is also accessible daily from 5:30?a.m. to midnight by Muni line 28.[59] The Marin Airporter, a private company, also offers service across the bridge between Marin County and San Francisco International Airport.[60]\\r\\nA visitor center and gift shop, dubbed the \\"Bridge Pavilion\\", is located on the San Francisco side of the bridge, adjacent to the southeast parking lot. It opened in 2012, in time for the bridge's 75th anniversary celebration. A cafe, outdoor exhibits, and restroom facilities are located nearby.[61] On the Marin side of the bridge, only accessible from the northbound lanes, is the H. Dana Bower Rest Area and Vista Point,[62] named after the first landscape architect for the California Division of Highways.[63]\\r\\nLands and waters under and around the bridge are homes to varieties of wildlife such as bobcats and sea lions.[64][65] Three species of cetaceans that had been absent in the area for many years show recent recoveries/(re)colonizations vicinity to the bridge, and researchers study them to strengthen protections, concerning actions by public and recommending to watch whales either from the bridge and nearby, or to use a local whale watching operator.[66][67][68]\\r\\nThe last of the construction bonds were retired in 1971, with $35?million in principal and nearly $39?million in interest raised entirely from bridge tolls.[53]\\r\\nIn November 2006, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District recommended a corporate sponsorship program for the bridge to address its operating deficit, projected at $80?million over five years. The District promised that the proposal, which it called a \\"partnership program,\\" would not include changing the name of the bridge or placing advertising on the bridge itself. In October 2007, the Board unanimously voted to discontinue the proposal and seek additional revenue through other means, most likely a toll increase.[69][70]\\r\\nIn an effort to save $19.2?million over the following 10 years, the Golden Gate District voted in January 2011 to eliminate all toll takers by 2012 and use only open road tolling.[71] Subsequently, this was delayed and toll taker elimination occurred in March 2013. The cost savings have been revised to $19 million over an eight-year period. In addition to the FasTrak electronic toll collection system, the Golden Gate District implemented the use of license plate tolling (branded as \\"Pay-by-Plate\\"), and also a one time payment system for drivers to pay before or after their trip on the bridge. Twenty-eight positions were eliminated as part of this plan.[72]\\r\\nOn April 7, 2014, the toll for users of FasTrak was increased from $5 to $6, while the toll for drivers using either the license plate tolling or the one time payment system was raised from $6 to $7. Bicycle, pedestrian, and northbound motor vehicle traffic remain toll free. For vehicles with more than two axles, the toll rate is $7 per axle for those using license plate tolling or the one time payment system, and $6 per axle for FasTrak users. During peak traffic hours, carpool vehicles carrying two or more people and motorcycles pay a discounted toll of $4; drivers must have Fastrak to take advantage of this carpool rate.[72] The Golden Gate Transportation District then planned to increase the tolls by 25 cents in July 2015, and then by another 25 cents each of the next three years.[73]\\r\\nIn March 2008, the Golden Gate Bridge District board approved a resolution to start congestion pricing at the Golden Gate Bridge, charging higher tolls during the peak hours, but rising and falling depending on traffic levels. This decision allowed the Bay Area to meet the federal requirement to receive $158?million in federal transportation funds from USDOT Urban Partnership grant.[75] As a condition of the grant, the congestion toll was to be in place by September 2009.[76][77]\\r\\nThe first results of the study, called the Mobility, Access and Pricing Study (MAPS), showed that a congestion pricing program is feasible.[78] The different pricing scenarios considered were presented in public meetings in December 2008.[79]\\r\\nIn August 2008, transportation officials ended the congestion pricing program in favor of varying rates for metered parking along the route to the bridge including on Lombard Street and Van Ness Avenue.[80]\\r\\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is the second-most used suicide site/suicide bridge in the world, after the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.[81] The deck is about 245 feet (75?m) above the water.[82] After a fall of four seconds, jumpers hit the water at around 75?mph or about 120?km/h. Most of the jumpers die from impact trauma. About 5% of the jumpers survive the initial impact but generally drown or die of hypothermia in the cold water.[83][84]\\r\\nAfter years of debate and over an estimated 1,500 deaths, suicide barriers began to be installed in April 2017. Construction will take approximately four years at a cost of over $200 million.[85]\\r\\nSince its completion, the Golden Gate Bridge has been closed because of weather conditions only three times: on December 1, 1951, because of gusts of 69?mph (111?km/h); on December 23, 1982, because of winds of 70?mph (113?km/h); and on December 3, 1983, because of wind gusts of 75?mph (121?km/h).[48]\\r\\nAn anemometer, placed midway between the two towers on the west side of the bridge, has been used to measure wind speeds. Another anemometer was placed on one of the towers.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern knowledge of the effect of earthquakes on structures led to a program to retrofit the Golden Gate to better resist seismic events. The proximity of the bridge to the San Andreas Fault places it at risk for a significant earthquake. Once thought to have been able to withstand any magnitude of foreseeable earthquake, the bridge was actually vulnerable to complete structural failure (i.e., collapse) triggered by the failure of supports on the 320-foot (98?m) arch over Fort Point.[86] A $392?million program was initiated to improve the structure's ability to withstand such an event with only minimal (repairable) damage. One challenging undertaking is completing this program without disrupting traffic. A complex electro-hydraulic synchronous lift system was custom built for construction of temporary support towers and a series of intricate lifts, transferring the loads from the existing bridge onto the temporary supports. This was completed with engineers from Balfour Beatty and Enerpac, accomplishing this task without disrupting day-to-day San Francisco commuter traffic.[87][88] The retrofit was planned to be completed in 2012.[88][89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former elevated approach to the Golden Gate Bridge through the San Francisco Presidio, known as Doyle Drive, dated to 1933 and was named after Frank P. Doyle, President and son of the founder of the Exchange Bank in Santa Rosa, and the man who, more than any other person, made it possible to build the Golden Gate Bridge.[90] The highway carried about 91,000 vehicles each weekday between downtown San Francisco and the North Bay and points north.[91] The road was deemed \\"vulnerable to earthquake damage\\", had a problematic 4-lane design, and lacked shoulders, and a San Francisco County Transportation Authority study recommended that it be replaced. Construction on the $1?billion[92] replacement, temporarily known as the Presidio Parkway, began in December 2009.[93] The elevated Doyle Drive was demolished on the weekend of April 27ÿ30, 2012, and traffic used a part of the partially completed Presidio Parkway, until it was switched onto the finished Presidio Parkway on the weekend of July 9ÿ12, 2015. As of May 2012, an official at Caltrans said there is no plan to permanently rename the portion known as Doyle Drive.[94]\\r\\nAs a prominent American landmark, the Golden Gate Bridge has been used in numerous media which includes books, films and video games.","input":"Who was the original design of the golden gate bridge?"},{"output":"Glenn Frey","context":"\\"Lyin' Eyes\\" is a song written by Don Henley and Glenn Frey and recorded in 1975 by the American rock band the Eagles, with Frey singing lead vocals.

The second of the Crocodile Dundee films, it is a sequel to Crocodile Dundee (1986) and was followed by Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (2001). Actors Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski reprise their roles as Mick Dundee and Sue Charlton, respectively; here shown opposing a Colombian drug cartel.\\r\\nThe film was directed by John Cornell and shot on location in New York City and Northern Territory, Australia. It cost $14 million to make.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA year has passed since the events of Crocodile Dundee, and Mick Dundee and Susan \\"Sue\\" Charlton are living happily together in New York. Although Mick's ignorance of city life is a hazard when he attempts to continue his former lifestyle, like blast fishing in Manhattan's waters, Sue's writing has made him a popular public figure. He later goes to work for Leroy Brown, a mild-mannered stationery salesman trying to live up to his self-perceived 'bad guy in the streets' image.\\r\\nWhile working for the DEA in Colombia, Sue's ex-husband Bob (mentioned, but not seen, in the first movie) takes photographs of a drug cartel leader's murder of an unknown person, and is spotted by one of the cartel's sentries. He sends the photographs to Sue before being murdered himself. Colombian Cartel leader Luis Rico and his brother and top lieutenant, Miguel, go to New York City to retrieve the photos.\\r\\nThe gangsters take Sue hostage, leading Mick to ask Leroy for help. Leroy contacts a local street gang, whom Mick asks to create a distraction by caterwauling at the mansion's perimeter, leading most of the cartel's guards on a wild goose chase while Mick rescues Sue. Rico is arrested but soon escapes police custody, and after a failed attempt by Rico to kill Sue, Mick decides to take Sue to Australia in order to fight on familiar ground. In Walkabout Creek, Mick is enthusiastically welcomed back by his friends. After provisioning, he and Sue take refuge on his personal land, named Belonga Mick (\\"Mick's Place\\"; see bilong in Tok Pisin). Here, Sue discovers that Mick legally owns land almost twice the size of New York State, including a gold mine.\\r\\nRico and his men track their quarry to Australia, where they hire some local thugs to assist them, but their Aboriginal tracker abandons them when he hears that their quarry is Mick. The gangsters then take Mick's friend Walter as a hostage, but Mick saves his friend by faking an attempt on Walter's life. Walter convinces the gangsters that Mick's failed attack was due to Walter being the only person suitable to guide them, so they take him as a replacement tracker. He then leads the gangsters on a false trail through the Outback territory, during which Mick, with the help of his Aboriginal friends, manages to reduce the opposition's numbers one by one, leaving the rest increasingly nervous. In the end, he retrieves Walter from Rico and Miguel, leaving the latter to face him alone.\\r\\nTired of chasing Dundee, Rico sets a bushfire to corner Mick, but Mick regains the upper hand, captures Rico, and switches clothes with him in order to lure Miguel into a vulnerable position. Sue and Walter, observing them from a distance, mistake Mick for Rico and take shots at him. Walter shoots Mick, though not fatally, and Rico tries to escape but is shot by Miguel (who mistakes him for Mick). Rico loses his balance and falls to his death in a ravine. Miguel is in turn shot and killed by Sue. Though thinking at first that Mick is dead, they soon re-unite with him (Walter's bullet had only hit Mick in the side), and Sue and Mick embrace. When Mick asks her whether she is ready to go home, Sue replies \\"I am home\\", concluding the film.\\r\\nThe film opened 25 May 1988 in the United States and Canada.[3][4]\\r\\nCrocodile Dundee II was also a worldwide hit,[5] but not as big as its predecessor.\\r\\nThe film grossed $24,916,805 in Australia,[6] which is equivalent to $48,843,593 in 2009 dollars.\\r\\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States by Paramount Pictures in May 1988.

It was first broadcast on the BBC Forces Programme on 29 January 1942.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach week a guest, called a 'castaway' during the programme, is asked to choose eight recordings (usually, but not always, music), a book and a luxury item that they would take if they were to be cast away on a desert island, whilst discussing their lives and the reasons for their choices. It was devised and originally presented by Roy Plomley. Since 2006, the programme has been presented by Kirsty Young.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 3,000 episodes have been recorded, with some guests having appeared more than once and some episodes featuring more than one guest.[2] An example of a guest who falls into both categories is Bob Monkhouse, who appeared with his co-writer Denis Goodwin on 12 December 1955 and in his own right on 20 December 1998.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuests are invited to imagine themselves cast away on a desert island, and choose eight recordings, originally gramophone records, to take with them; discussion of their choices permits a review of their life. Excerpts from their choices are played or, in the case of short pieces, the whole work. At the end of the programme they choose the one piece they regard most highly. Guests are also automatically given the Complete Works of Shakespeare and either the Bible or another appropriate religious or philosophical work. They are then prompted to select a third book to accompany them. Popular choices include Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. Actress Judi Dench, who suffers from macular degeneration, was permitted to take an audiobook in place of a printed manuscript.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuests also choose one luxury, which must be inanimate and of no use in escaping the island or allowing communication from outside. Roy Plomley[6] enforced these rules strictly. He did, however, grant a special dispensation to Princess Michael of Kent, who chose her pet cat.[7][8] The rules are, however, less strictly enforced today; for instance, Lawley allowed John Cleese to take Michael Palin with him, on the condition that he was dead and stuffed. Examples of luxuries have included champagne[9] and a piano, the latter of which is one of the most requested luxuries.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Plomley's death in 1985, the programme was presented by Michael Parkinson and from 1988 by Sue Lawley.[6] Lawley stepped down in August 2006 after 18 years, her final castaway being actress Joan Plowright.[11] She was replaced by Kirsty Young, who interviewed illustrator Quentin Blake for her first show, broadcast on 1 October 2006.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first castaway was Vic Oliver, and several castaways, including Celia Johnson, Arthur Askey, Trevor Nunn, John Schlesinger, Kenneth Williams, Terry Wogan, Brian Rix, David Attenborough and Adele Leigh have been cast away more than once. The most requested piece of music over the first 60 years was \\"Ode to Joy\\", the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.[12] One of the most remarked broadcasts was Elisabeth Schwarzkopf's 1958 selection of seven of her own recordings.[13][14] This record was subsequently beaten by British pianist Dame Moura Lympany on her second appearance on the programme on 28 July 1979 when all eight of her selections were of her own recordings.[15] In the early 1970s, Roy Plomley attempted to interview Alistair MacLean, but ended up speaking to somebody else with the same name ÿ and the programme was never broadcast.[16] In January of 1981, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, appeared as a castaway on the show.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlomley originally wanted the sounds of \\"surf breaking on a shore and the cries of sea birds\\" to open and close each programme. But Leslie Prowne, the head of popular record programmes at the BBC, was concerned that it lacked definition and insisted that music should also be used. Plomley and the series' producer Frederic Piffard selected \\"By the Sleepy Lagoon\\", composed by Eric Coates (who appeared on the show in 1951). The tune has been used since the first transmission in 1942. The sound of herring gulls has accompanied the music except for a period of time in 1964 when tropical bird sounds were used.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil late September 2009, Desert Island Discs could not be heard on the BBC's iPlayer service, which allows most programmes to be heard up to a week after transmission. The programme's website[19] stated that this was due to rights issues, as explained in The Sunday Times in 2006.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was announced on 27 September 2009 that an agreement had been reached as a result of which the programme would be available to stream via the iPlayer.[21] The first episode available through the iPlayer was with Barry Manilow. Subsequently, the programme was also made available as a podcast,[22] beginning with the edition broadcast on 29 November 2009, which featured Morrissey. However, due to music clearance issues, the music selections on the podcast versions are reduced to only playing for around 30 seconds or so (and in rare instances are unavailable, as mentioned in an announcement made by Kirsty Young at the appropriate point of the programme).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 March 2011, the BBC placed more than 500 episodes from the show's archive online to listen to via iPlayer. Other episodes have since been added, both new and old.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early years of the BBC, programmes were broadcast live and were generally not recorded. This, in addition to the BBC's policy of wiping that was applied during the 1950s and 1960s, means very few episodes from the first 20 years of the show are known to exist; the earliest episode still in existence is from 1951 and features actress Margaret Lockwood. Several extracts were preserved for posterity at the request of the guests, such as an extract featuring Alfred Hitchcock where he speaks about his films The Pleasure Garden (1925) and Rebecca (1940), gives his view on the changing landscape of the film industry and briefly discusses his then upcoming film Psycho (1960).","input":"Who was the first presenter of desert island discs?"},{"output":"the ramp","context":"Ancient Egyptian technology describes devices and technologies invented or used in Ancient Egypt. The Egyptians invented and used many simple machines, such as the ramp and the lever, to aid construction processes. They used rope trusses to stiffen the beam of ships. Egyptian paper, made from papyrus, and pottery were mass-produced and exported throughout the Mediterranean basin. The wheel was used for a number of purposes, but chariots only came into use after the Second Intermediate period. The Egyptians also played an important role in developing Mediterranean maritime technology including ships and lighthouses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant advances in ancient Egypt during the dynastic period include astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. Their geometry was a necessary outgrowth of surveying to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland, which was flooded annually by the Nile river. The 3,4,5 right triangle and other rules of thumb served to represent rectilinear structures, and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt. Egypt also was a center of alchemy research for much of the western world.\\r\\nThe word paper comes from the Greek term for the ancient Egyptian writing material called papyrus, which was formed from beaten strips of papyrus plants. Papyrus was produced as early as 3000?BC in Egypt, and sold to ancient Greece and Rome. The establishment of the Library of Alexandria limited the supply of papyrus for others. As a result, according to the Roman historian Pliny (Natural History records, xiii.21), parchment was invented under the patronage of Eumenes II of Pergamon to build his rival library at Pergamon. This however is a myth; parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.\\r\\nEgyptian hieroglyphs, a phonetic writing system, served as the basis for the Phoenician alphabet from which later alphabets were derived. With this ability, writing and record keeping, the Egyptians developed one of the if not the first decimal system.[1][2][3]\\r\\nThe city of Alexandria retained preeminence for its records and scrolls with its library. That ancient library was damaged by fire when it fell under Roman rule,[4] and was destroyed completely by 642?CE.[5][6] With it, a huge amount of antique literature, history, and knowledge was lost.\\r\\nSome of the older tools used in the construction of Egyptian housing included reeds and clay. According to Lucas and Harris, reeds were plastered with clay in order to keep out of heat and cold more effectually. [7] Other tools that were used were \\"limestone, chiseled stones, wooden mallets, and stone hammers\\". [8] With these tools, ancient Egyptians were able to create more than just housing, but also sculptures of their gods, goddesses, pyramids, etc.\\r\\nMany temples from Ancient Egypt are not standing today. Some are in ruin from wear and tear, while others have been lost entirely. The Egyptian structures are among the largest constructions ever conceived and built by humans. They constitute one of the most potent and enduring symbols of Ancient Egyptian civilization. Temples and tombs built by a pharaoh famous for her projects, Hatshepsut, were massive and included many colossal statues of her. Pharaoh Tutankamun's rock-cut tomb in the Valley of the Kings was full of jewellery and antiques. In some late myths, Ptah was identified as the primordial mound and had called creation into being, he was considered the deity of craftsmen, and in particular, of stone-based crafts. Imhotep, who was included in the Egyptian pantheon, was the first documented engineer.[9]\\r\\nIn Hellenistic Egypt, lighthouse technology was developed, the most famous example being the Lighthouse of Alexandria. Alexandria was a port for the ships that traded the goods manufactured in Egypt or imported into Egypt. A giant cantilevered hoist lifted cargo to and from ships. The lighthouse itself was designed by Sostratus of Cnidus and built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247?BC) on the island of Pharos in Alexandria, Egypt, which has since become a peninsula. This lighthouse was renowned in its time and knowledge of it was never lost. A 2006 drawing of it created from the study of many references, is shown at the right.\\r\\nThe Nile valley has been the site of one of the most influential civilizations in the world with its architectural monuments, which include the pyramids of Giza and the Great Sphinxamong the largest and most famous buildings in the world.\\r\\nThe most famous pyramids are the Egyptian pyramidshuge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the largest constructions by humans. Pyramids functioned as tombs for pharaohs. In Ancient Egypt, a pyramid was referred to as mer, literally \\"place of ascendance.\\" The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest in Egypt and one of the largest in the world. The base is over 13 acres (53,000?m2) in area. It is one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and the only one of the seven to survive into modern times. The Ancient Egyptians capped the peaks of their pyramids with gold and covered their faces with polished white limestone, although many of the stones used for the finishing purpose have fallen or been removed for use on other structures over the millennia.\\r\\nThe Red Pyramid of Egypt (c.26th century BC), named for the light crimson hue of its exposed granite surfaces, is the third largest of Egyptian pyramids. Menkaure's Pyramid, likely dating to the same era, was constructed of limestone and granite blocks. The Great Pyramid of Giza (c. 2580 BC) contains a huge granite sarcophagus fashioned of \\"Red Aswan Granite.\\" The mostly ruined Black Pyramid dating from the reign of Amenemhat III once had a polished granite pyramidion or capstone, now on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (see Dahshur). Other uses in Ancient Egypt,[10] include columns, door lintels, sills, jambs, and wall and floor veneer.\\r\\nThe ancient Egyptians had some of the first monumental stone buildings (such as in Sakkara). How the Egyptians worked the solid granite is still a matter of debate. Archaeologist Patrick Hunt[11] has postulated that the Egyptians used emery shown to have higher hardness on the Mohs scale. Regarding construction, of the various methods possibly used by builders, the lever moved and uplifted obelisks weighing more than 100 tons.\\r\\nObelisks were a prominent part of the architecture of the ancient Egyptians, who placed them in pairs at the entrances of various monuments and important buildings, such as temples. In 1902, Encyclop?dia Britannica wrote, \\"The earliest temple obelisk still in position is that of Senusret I of the XIIth Dynasty at Heliopolis (68?feet high)\\". The word \\"obelisk\\" is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because Herodotus, the great traveler, was the first writer to describe the objects. Twenty-nine ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the unfinished obelisk being built by Hatshepsut to celebrate her sixteenth year as pharaoh. It broke while being carved out of the quarry and was abandoned when another one was begun to replace it. The broken one was found at Aswan and provides the only insight into the methods of how they were hewn. The obelisk symbolized the sky deity Ra and during the brief religious reformation of Akhenaten, was said to be a petrified ray of the Aten, the sun disk. It is hypothesized by New York University Egyptologist Patricia Blackwell Gary and Astronomy senior editor Richard Talcott that the shapes of the ancient Egyptian pyramid and Obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the sun (the sun-god Ra being the Egyptians' greatest deity).[12] It was also thought that the deity existed within the structure. The Egyptians also used pillars extensively.\\r\\nIt is unknown whether the Ancient Egyptians had kites, but a team led by Maureen Clemmons and Mory Gharib raised a 5,900-pound, 15-foot (4.6?m) obelisk into vertical position with a kite, a system of pulleys, and a support frame.[13] Maureen Clemmons developed the idea that the ancient Egyptians used kites for work.[13] Ramps have been reported as being widely used in Ancient Egypt. A ramp is an inclined plane, or a plane surface set at an angle (other than a right angle) against a horizontal surface. The inclined plane permits one to overcome a large resistance by applying a relatively small force through a longer distance than the load is to be raised. In civil engineering the slope (ratio of rise/run) is often referred to as a grade or gradient. An inclined plane is one of the commonly-recognized simple machines. Maureen Clemmons subsequently lead a team of researchers demonstrating a kite made of natural material and reinforced with shellac (which according to their research pulled with 97% the efficiency of nylon), in a 9?mph wind, would easily pull an average 2-ton pyramid stone up the 1st two courses of a pyramid (in collaboration with Cal Poly, Pomona, on a 53-stone pyramid built in Rosamond, CA).\\r\\nThe Ancient Egyptians had knowledge to some extent of sail construction. This is governed by the science of aerodynamics.[14] The earliest Egyptian sails were simply placed to catch the wind and push a vessel.[15] Later Egyptian sails dating to 2400 BCE were built with the recognition that ships could sail against the wind using the lift of the sails.[15][16] Queen Hatshepsut oversaw the preparations and funding of an expedition of five ships, each measuring seventy feet long, and with several sails.[dubious ÿ discuss][citation needed]Various others exist, also.\\r\\nEgyptian ship with a loose-footed sail, similar to a longship.

Note that the sail is stretched between yards.\\r\\nLoading Egyptian vessels with the produce of Punt. Shows folded sails, lowered upper yard, yard construction, and heavy deck cargo.\\r\\nAncient Egyptians had experience with building a variety of ships.[17][18][19] Some of them survive to this day as Khufu Solar ship.[20] The ships were found in many areas of Egypt as the Abydos boats[21][22][23] and remnants of other ships were found near the pyramids.[22][24][25]\\r\\nSneferu's ancient cedar wood ship Praise of the Two Lands is the first reference recorded to a ship being referred to by name.[26]\\r\\nAlthough quarter rudders were the norm in Nile navigation, the Egyptians were the first to use also stern-mounted rudders (not of the modern type but center mounted steering oars).\\r\\nIrrigation as the artificial application of water to the soil was used to some extent in Ancient Egypt, a hydraulic civilization (which entails hydraulic engineering).[27] In crop production it is mainly used to replace missing rainfall in periods of drought, as opposed to reliance on direct rainfall (referred to as dryland farming or as rainfed farming). Before technology advanced, the people of Egypt relied on the natural flow of the Nile River to tend to the crops. Although the Nile provided sufficient watering survival domesticated animals, crops, and the people of Egypt, there were times where the Nile would flood the area wreaking havoc amongst the land. [28] There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhet III in the twelfth dynasty (about 1800 BCE) using the natural lake of the Fay?m as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons, as the lake swelled annually with the flooding of the Nile.[29] Construction of drainage canals reduced the problems of major flooding from entering homes and areas of crops; but because it was a hydraulic civilization, much of the water management was controlled in a systematic way. [30]\\r\\nEgyptian knowledge of glassmaking was advanced.[31] The earliest known glass beads from Egypt were made during the New Kingdom around 1500?BC and were produced in a variety of colors. They were made by winding molten glass around a metal bar and were highly prized as a trading commodity, especially blue beads, which were believed to have magical powers. The Egyptians made small jars and bottles using the core-formed method. Glass threads were wound around a bag of sand tied to a rod. The glass was continually reheated to fuse the threads together. The glass-covered sand bag was kept in motion until the required shape and thickness was achieved. The rod was allowed to cool, then finally the bag was punctured and the sand poured out and reused . The Egyptians also created the first colored glass rods which they used to create colorful beads and decorations. They also worked with cast glass, which was produced by pouring molten glass into a mold, much like iron and the more modern crucible steel.[32]\\r\\nThe Egyptians were a practical people and this is reflected in their astronomy[33] in contrast to Babylonia where the first astronomical texts were written in astrological terms.[34] Even before Upper and Lower Egypt were unified in 3000 BCE, observations of the night sky had influenced the development of a religion in which many of its principal deities were heavenly bodies. In Lower Egypt, priests built circular mud-brick walls with which to make a false horizon where they could mark the position of the sun as it rose at dawn, and then with a plumb-bob note the northern or southern turning points (solstices). This allowed them to discover that the sun disc, personified as Ra, took 365 days to travel from his birthplace at the winter solstice and back to it. Meanwhile, in Upper Egypt a lunar calendar was being developed based on the behavior of the moon and the reappearance of Sirius in its heliacal rising after its annual absence of about 70 days.[35]\\r\\nAfter unification, problems with trying to work with two calendars (both depending upon constant observation) led to a merged, simplified civil calendar with twelve 30-day months, three seasons of four months each, plus an extra five days, giving a 365-year day but with no way of accounting for the extra quarter day each year. Day and night were split into 24 units, each personified by a deity. A sundial found on Seti I's cenotaph with instructions for its use shows us that the daylight hours were at one time split into 10 units, with 12 hours for the night and an hour for the morning and evening twilights.[36] However, by Seti I's time day and night were normally divided into 12 hours each, the length of which would vary according to the time of year.\\r\\nKey to much of this was the motion of the sun god Ra and his annual movement along the horizon at sunrise. Out of Egyptian myths such as those around Ra and the sky goddess Nut came the development of the Egyptian calendar, time keeping, and even concepts of royalty. An astronomical ceiling in the burial chamber of Ramesses VI shows the sun being born from Nut in the morning, traveling along her body during the day and being swallowed at night.\\r\\nDuring the Fifth Dynasty six kings built sun temples in honour of Ra. The temple complexes built by Niuserre at Abu Gurab and Userkaf at Abusir have been excavated and have astronomical alignments, and the roofs of some of the buildings could have been used by observers to view the stars, calculate the hours at night and predict the sunrise for religious festivals.[citation needed]\\r\\nClaims have been made that precession of the equinoxes was known in Ancient Egypt prior to the time of Hipparchus.[37] This has been disputed however on the grounds that pre-Hipparchus texts do not mention precession and that \\"it is only by cunning interpretation of ancient myths and images, which are ostensibly about something else, that precession can be discerned in them, aided by some pretty esoteric numerological speculation involving the 72 years that mark one degree of shift in the zodiacal system and any number of permutations by multiplication, division, and addition.\\" [38]\\r\\nNote however that the Egyptian observation of a slowly changing stellar alignment over a multi-year period does not necessarily mean that they understood or even cared what was going on. For instance, from the Middle Kingdom onwards they used a table with entries for each month to tell the time of night from the passing of constellations. These went in error after a few centuries because of their calendar and precession, but were copied (with scribal errors) long after they lost their practical usefulness or the possibility of understanding and use of them in the current years, rather than the years in which they were originally used.\\r\\nThe Edwin Smith Papyrus is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document which attempts to describe and analyze the brain: given this, it might be seen as the very beginnings of neuroscience. However, medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology was largely ineffective.[39] According to a paper published by Michael D. Parkins, 72% of 260 medical prescriptions in the Hearst Papyrus had no curative elements.[40] According to Michael D. Parkins, sewage pharmacology first began in ancient Egypt and was continued through the Middle Ages,[39] and while the use of animal dung can have curative properties,[41] it is not without its risk. Practices such as applying cow dung to wounds, ear piercing, tattooing, and chronic ear infections were important factors in developing tetanus.[42] Frank J. Snoek wrote that Egyptian medicine used fly specks, lizard blood, swine teeth, and other such remedies which he believes could have been harmful.[43]\\r\\nMummification of the dead was not always practiced in Egypt. Once the practice began, an individual was placed at a final resting place through a set of rituals and protocol. The Egyptian funeral was a complex ceremony including various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in honor of the deceased. The poor, who could not afford expensive tombs, were buried in shallow graves in the sand, and because of the arid environment they were often naturally mummified.\\r\\nEvidence indicates that Egyptians made use of potter's wheels in the manufacturing of pottery from as early as the 4th Dynasty.[44] Chariots, however, are only believed to have been introduced by the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate period;[45] during the New Kingdom era, chariotry became central to Egypt's military.\\r\\nThe Egyptians developed a variety of furniture. There in the lands of ancient Egypt is the first evidence for stools, beds, and tables (such as from the tombs similar to Tutenkhamen's). Recovered Ancient Egyptian furniture includes a third millennium BC bed discovered in the Tarkhan Tomb, a c.2550?BC. gilded set from the tomb of Queen Hetepheres I, and a c. 1550?BC. stool from Thebes.\\r\\nSome have suggested that the Egyptians had some form of understanding electric phenomena from observing lightning and interacting with electric fish (such as Malapterurus electricus) or other animals (such as electric eels).[46] The comment about lightning appears to come from a misunderstanding of a text referring to \\"high poles covered with copper plates\\" to argue this[47] but Dr. Bolko Stern has written in detail explaining why the copper covered tops of poles (which were lower than the associated pylons) do not relate to electricity or lightning, pointing out that no evidence of anything used to manipulate electricity had been found in Egypt and that this was a magical and not a technical installation.[48]\\r\\nThose exploring fringe theories of ancient technology have suggested that there were electric lights used in Ancient Egypt. Engineers have constructed a working model based on their interpretation of a relief found in the Hathor temple at the Dendera Temple complex.[49] Authors (such as Peter Krassa and Reinhard Habeck) have produced a basic theory of the device's operation.[49] The standard explanation, however, for the Dendera light, which comprises three stone reliefs (one single and a double representation) is that the depicted image represents a lotus leaf and flower from which a sacred snake is spawned in accordance with Egyptian mythological beliefs. This sacred snake sometimes is identified as the Milky Way (the snake) in the night sky (the leaf, lotus, or \\"bulb\\") that became identified with Hathor because of her similar association in creation.\\r\\nUnder Hellenistic rule, Egypt was one of the most prosperous regions of the Hellenistic civilization. The ancient Egyptian city of Rhakotis was renovated as Alexandria, which became the largest city around the Mediterranean Basin. Under Roman rule, Egypt was one of the most prosperous regions of the Roman Empire, with Alexandria being second only to ancient Rome in size.\\r\\nRecent scholarship suggests that the water wheel originates from Ptolemaic Egypt, where it appeared by the 3rd century BC.[50][51] This is seen as an evolution of the paddle-driven water-lifting wheels that had been known in Egypt a century earlier.[50] According to John Peter Oleson, both the compartmented wheel and the hydraulic Noria may have been invented in Egypt by the 4th century BC, with the Sakia being invented there a century later. This is supported by archeological finds at Faiyum, Egypt, where the oldest archeological evidence of a water-wheel has been found, in the form of a Sakia dating back to the 3rd century BC. A papyrus dating to the 2nd century BC also found in Faiyum mentions a water wheel used for irrigation, a 2nd-century BC fresco found at Alexandria depicts a compartmented Sakia, and the writings of Callixenus of Rhodes mention the use of a Sakia in Ptolemaic Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy IV in the late 3rd century BC.[51]\\r\\nAncient Greek technology was often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. Ancient Roman technology is a set of artifacts and customs which supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years.\\r\\nUnder Arab rule, Egypt once again became one of the most prosperous regions around the Mediterranean. The Egyptian city of Cairo was founded by the Fatimid Caliphate and served as its capital city. At the time, Cairo was second only to Baghdad, capital of the rival Abbasid Caliphate. After the fall of Baghdad, however, Cairo overtook it as the largest city in the Mediterranean region until the early modern period.\\r\\nInventions in medieval Islam covers the inventions developed in the medieval Islamic world, a region that extended from Al-Andalus and Africa in the west to the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia in the east.

The word soaring is also used for the sport.[2]\\r\\nGliding as a sport began in the 1920s. Initially the objective was to increase the duration of flights but soon pilots attempted cross-country flights away from the place of launch. Improvements in aerodynamics and in the understanding of weather phenomena have allowed greater distances at higher average speeds. Long distances are now flown using any of the main sources of rising air: ridge lift, thermals and lee waves. When conditions are favourable, experienced pilots can now fly hundreds of kilometres before returning to their home airfields; occasionally flights of more than 1,000 kilometres (621?mi) are achieved.[3]\\r\\nSome competitive pilots fly in races around pre-defined courses. These gliding competitions test pilots' abilities to make best use of local weather conditions as well as their flying skills. Local and national competitions are organized in many countries, and there are biennial World Gliding Championships.[4][5] Techniques to maximize a glider's speed around the day's task in a competition have been developed, including the optimum speed to fly, navigation using GPS and the carrying of water ballast. If the weather deteriorates pilots are sometimes unable to complete a cross-country flight. Consequently, they may need to land elsewhere, perhaps in a field, but motorglider pilots can avoid this by starting an engine.\\r\\nPowered-aircraft and winches are the two most common means of launching gliders. These and other launch methods require assistance and facilities such as airfields, tugs, and winches. These are usually provided by gliding clubs who also train new pilots and maintain high safety standards. Although in most countries the standards of safety of the pilots and the aircraft are the responsibility of governmental bodies, the clubs and sometimes national gliding associations often have delegated authority.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development of heavier-than-air flight in the half century between Sir George Cayley's coachman in 1853 and the Wright brothers in 1903 mainly involved gliders (see Aviation history). However, the sport of gliding only emerged after the First World War, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles,[6] which imposed severe restrictions on the manufacture and use of single-seat powered aircraft in Germany's Weimar Republic. Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers in the rest of the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster. With the active support of the German government, there were 50,000 glider pilots by 1937.[7] The first German gliding competition was held at the Wasserkuppe in 1920,[8][9]:51 organized by Oskar Ursinus. The best flight lasted two minutes and set a world distance record of 2 kilometres (1.2?mi).[9]:54 Within ten years, it had become an international event in which the achieved durations and distances had increased greatly. In 1931, Gunther Gr?nhoff flew 272 kilometres (169?mi) on the front of a storm from Munich to Kada (Kaaden in German) in Western Czechoslovakia, farther than had been thought possible.[9]:85\\r\\nIn the 1930s, gliding spread to many other countries. In the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin gliding was a demonstration sport, and it was scheduled to be a full Olympic sport in the 1940 Games.[9]:148 A glider, the Olympia, was developed in Germany for the event, but World War II intervened. By 1939 the major gliding records were held by Russians, including a distance record of 748 kilometres (465?mi).[9]:107 During the war, the sport of gliding in Europe was largely suspended, though several German fighter aces in the conflict, including Erich Hartmann, began their flight training in gliders.[10] :46\\r\\nGliding did not return to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a shortage of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.)[9]:172 The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fdration Aronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.[11]\\r\\nIn many countries during the 1950s a large number of trained pilots wanted to continue flying. Many were also aeronautical engineers who could design, build and maintain gliders. They started both clubs and manufacturers, many of which still exist. This stimulated the development of both gliding and gliders, for example the membership of the Soaring Society of America increased from 1,000 to 16,000 by 1980.[12] The increased numbers of pilots, greater knowledge and improving technology helped set new records, for example the pre-war altitude record was doubled by 1950,[9]:195 and the first 1,000-kilometre (620?mi) flight was achieved in 1964.[13] New materials such as glass fiber and carbon fiber, advances in wing shapes and airfoils, electronic instruments, the Global Positioning System and improved weather forecasting have since allowed many pilots to make flights that were once extraordinary. Today over 550 pilots have made flights over 1,000 kilometres (620?mi).[14] Although there is no Olympic competition, there are the World Gliding Championships. The first event was held at the Samedan in 1948.[9]:161 Since World War II it has been held every two years. There are now six classes open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes. The latest worldwide statistics for 2011 indicate that Germany, the sport's birthplace, is still a center of the gliding world: it accounted for 27?percent of the world's glider pilots,[15] and the three major glider manufacturers are still based there. However the meteorological conditions that allow soaring are common and the sport has been taken up in many countries. At the last count there were over 111,000 active civilian glider pilots and 32,920 gliders,[15] plus an unknown number of military cadets and aircraft. Clubs actively seek new members by giving trial flights, which are also a useful source of revenue for them.[16]\\r\\nGlider pilots can stay airborne for hours by flying through air that is ascending as fast or faster than the glider itself is descending, thus gaining potential energy.[17] The most commonly used sources of rising air are\\r\\nRidge lift rarely allows pilots to climb much higher than about 600 metres (2,000?ft) above the terrain; thermals, depending on the climate and terrain, can allow climbs in excess of 3,000 metres (9,800?ft) in flat country and much higher above mountains;[17] wave lift has allowed a glider to reach an altitude of 15,447 metres (50,679?ft).[18] In a few countries such as the UK, gliders may continue to climb into the clouds in uncontrolled airspace,[19] but in many European countries the pilot must stop climbing before reaching the cloud base (see Visual Flight Rules).[20]\\r\\nThermals begin as bubbles of rising air that are formed on the ground through the warming of the surface by sunlight.[17] If the air contains enough moisture, the water will condense from the rising air and form cumulus clouds.[21]:41 When the air has little moisture or when an inversion stops the warm air from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Without clouds or dust devils to mark the thermals, thermals are not always associated with any feature on the ground. The pilot must then use both skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical speed indicator called a variometer that quickly indicates climbs and descents. Occasionally reliable thermals can be found in the exhaust gases from power stations or from fires.[22] :6[23]:72[24]:29\\r\\nOnce a thermal is encountered, the pilot can fly in tight circles to keep the glider within the thermal, so gaining altitude before flying towards the destination or to the next thermal. This is known as \\"thermalling\\". Alternatively, glider pilots on cross-country flights may choose to 'dolphin'. This is when the pilot merely slows down in rising air, and then speeds up again in the non-rising air, thus following an undulating flight path. Dolphining allows the pilot to minimize the loss of height over great distances without spending time turning. Climb rates depend on conditions, but rates of several meters per second are common and can be maximized by gliders equipped with flaps. Thermals can also be formed in a line usually because of the wind or the terrain, creating cloud streets. These can allow the pilot to fly straight while climbing in continuous lift.[22]:61\\r\\nAs it requires rising heated air, thermalling is most effective in mid-latitudes from spring through late summer. During winter the sun's heat can only create weak thermals, but ridge and wave lift can still be used during this period.[21]:108\\r\\nA ridge soaring pilot uses upward air movements caused when the wind blows on to the sides of hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun.[6][24]:135 In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, although records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of exhaustion.[25]\\r\\nThe powerfully rising and sinking air in mountain waves was discovered by glider pilot, Wolf Hirth, in 1933.[9]:100 Gliders can sometimes climb in these waves to great altitudes, although pilots must use supplementary oxygen to avoid hypoxia.[24]:149\\r\\nThis lift is often marked by long, stationary lenticular (lens-shaped) clouds lying perpendicular to the wind.[6] Mountain wave was used to set the current altitude record of 15,453 metres (50,699?ft) on 29 August 2006 over El Calafate, Argentina. The pilots, Einar Enevoldson and Steve Fossett, wore pressure suits.[18] A new record of 15,902 metres (52,172?ft) is awaiting ratification.[26] The current world distance record of 3,008 kilometres (1,869?mi) by Klaus Ohlmann (set on 21 January 2003)[27] was also flown using mountain waves in South America.\\r\\nA rare wave phenomenon is known as Morning Glory, a roll cloud producing strong lift. Pilots near Australia's Gulf of Carpentaria make use of it in springtime.[28]\\r\\nThe boundaries where two air masses meet are known as convergence zones.[29]:100 These can occur in sea breezes or in desert regions. In a sea-breeze front, cold air from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a boundary between two masses of air like a shallow cold front. Glider pilots can gain altitude by flying along the intersection as if it were a ridge of land. Convergence may occur over considerable distances and so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.[24]:55\\r\\nGlider pilots have occasionally been able to use a technique called \\"dynamic soaring\\"[22]:35 allowing a glider to gain kinetic energy by repeatedly crossing the boundary between air masses of different horizontal velocity. However, such zones of high \\"wind gradient\\" are usually too close to the ground to be used safely by gliders.[22]:35\\r\\nMost gliders do not have engines or at least engines that would allow a take-off under their own power. Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current practice for the type of launch being used. Licensing rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.[30][31]\\r\\nIn an aerotow a powered aircraft is attached to a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope.[32]:133 A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails.[33] There is a remote chance that the weak link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.\\r\\nDuring the aerotow, the glider pilot keeps the glider behind the tow-plane in either the \\"low tow\\" position, just below the wake from the tow-plane, or the \\"high tow\\" position just above the wake.[34]:7ÿ11 In Australia the convention is to fly in low tow, whereas in the United States and Europe the high tow prevails. One rare aerotow variation is attaching two gliders to one tow-plane, using a short rope for the high-towed glider and a long rope for the low tow. The current record is nine gliders in the same aerotow.[35]\\r\\nGliders are often launched using a stationary ground-based winch mounted on a heavy vehicle.[32] This method is widely used at many European clubs, often in addition to an aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500?ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride.[32]:78 A strong headwind will result in higher launches.\\r\\nWinch launches are much cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch may also be used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of the shape of the field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short. A break in the cable or the weak link[Note 1] during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.[32]:87[36]:16ÿ7\\r\\nAnother method of launching, the \\"autotow\\", is rarer nowadays.[32] The direct autotow requires a hard surface and a powerful vehicle that is attached to the glider by a long steel cable. After gently taking up slack in the cable, the driver accelerates hard and as a result the glider rises rapidly to about 400?metres (1,300?ft), especially if there is a good headwind and a runway of 1.5 kilometres (0.93?mi) or more. This method has also been used on desert dry lakes.[37]\\r\\nA variation on the direct autotow is known as the \\"reverse pulley\\" method. In this method, the truck drives towards the glider being launched. The cable passes around a pulley at the far end of the airfield, resulting in an effect similar to that of a winch launch.[32]\\r\\nBungee launching was widely used in the early days of gliding, and occasionally gliders are still launched from the top of a gently sloping hill into a strong breeze using a substantial multi-stranded rubber band, or \\"bungee\\".[38] For this launch method, the glider's main wheel rests in a small concrete trough. The hook normally used for winch-launching is instead attached to the middle of the bungee. Each end is then pulled by three or four people. One group runs slightly to the left, the other to the right. Once the tension in the bungee is high enough, the glider is released and the glider's wheel pops out of the trough. The glider gains just enough energy to leave the ground and fly away from the hill.[38]\\r\\nA glider can simply be pushed down a slope until gravity can create enough speed for it to take off.[39]\\r\\nOne of the measures of a glider's performance is the distance that it can fly for each meter it descends, known as its glide ratio. Glide ratio is dependent on an aircraft's class, and can typically range from 44:1 (for modern designs in the Standard Class) up to 70:1 (for the largest aircraft). A good gliding performance combined with regular sources of rising air enables modern gliders to fly long distances at high speeds.[22][40] The weather is a major factor in determining cross-country speeds. The record average speed for 1,000 kilometres (620?mi) is 203.1 kilometres per hour (126.2?mph)[27] and required unusually good conditions, but even in places with less favorable conditions (such as Northern Europe) a skilled pilot can expect to complete flights over 500 kilometres (310?mi) every year.[41]\\r\\nAs the performance of gliders improved in the 1960s, the concept of flying as far away as possible became unpopular with the crews who had to retrieve the gliders. Pilots now usually plan to fly around a course (called a task) via turn-points, returning to the starting point.[42]:133\\r\\nIn addition to just trying to fly further, glider pilots also race each other in competitions.[43] The winner is the fastest, or, if the weather conditions are poor, the furthest round the course. Tasks of up to 1,000?km have been set[44] and average speeds of 120?km/h are not unusual.[45]\\r\\nInitially, ground observers confirmed that pilots had rounded the turn-points. Later, the glider pilots photographed these places and submitted the film for verification. Today, gliders carry secure GNSS Flight Recorders that record the position every few seconds from GPS satellites.[46] These recording devices now provide the proof that the turn-points have been reached.[47]\\r\\nNational competitions generally last one week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed the greatest number of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time.[48] Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so traditional gliding competitions are difficult to televise. In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the Grand Prix, has been introduced.[49] Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, cockpit mounted cameras, telemetry giving the positions of the gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring.\\r\\nThere is a decentralized Internet-based competition called the Online Contest, in which pilots upload their GPS data files and are automatically scored based on distance flown. Worldwide, 6,703?pilots registered for this contest in 2010.[41]\\r\\nSoaring pioneer Paul MacCready is usually credited with developing mathematical principles for optimizing the speed at which to fly when cross-country soaring,[50]:11-10 although it was first described by Wolfgang Sp?te in 1938.[51] The speed to fly theory allows the optimal cruising speed between thermals to be computed, using thermal strength, glider performance and other variables. It accounts for the fact that if a pilot flies faster between thermals, the next thermal is reached sooner. However at higher speeds the glider also sinks faster, requiring the pilot to spend more time circling to regain the altitude. The MacCready speed represents the optimal trade-off between cruising and circling. Most competition pilots use MacCready theory to optimize their average speeds, and have the calculations programmed in their flight computers, or use a \\"McCready ring\\", a rotatable bezel on the glider's variometer to indicate the best speed to fly. The greatest factor in maximizing average speed, however, remains the ability of the pilot to find the strongest lift.[22]:56\\r\\nOn cross-country flights on days when strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar.[50]:5ÿ13 Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time.[22]:63 If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.[22]:64\\r\\nOn days with particularly strong and widespread lift pilots can attain high average speeds by alternating periods of fast flight with pull-ups, merely slowing down in areas of lift without deviating from the course. This 'dolphining' technique can result in high average speeds because the height lost can be minimised until particularly strong lift is encountered when circling would be most effective.\\r\\nAchievements in gliding have been marked by the awarding of badges since the 1920s.[52][53] For the lower badges, such as the first solo flight, national gliding federations set their own criteria. Typically, a bronze badge shows preparation for cross-country flight, including precise landings and witnessed soaring flights. Higher badges follow the standards set down by the Gliding Commission of the Fdration Aronautique Internationale (FAI).[54]\\r\\nThe FAI's Sporting Code defines the rules for observers and recording devices to validate the claims for badges that are defined by kilometers of distance and meters of altitude gained.[55] The Silver-C badge was introduced in 1930.[53] Earning the Silver Badge shows that a glider pilot has achieved an altitude gain of at least 1,000 metres (3,281?ft), made a five-hour duration flight, and has flown cross-country for a straight-line distance of at least 50 kilometres (31?mi): these three attainments are usually, but not invariably, achieved in separate flights. The Gold and Diamond Badges require pilots to fly higher and further. A pilot who has completed the three parts of the Diamond Badge has flown 300 kilometres (186?mi) to a pre-defined goal, has flown 500 kilometres (311?mi) in one flight (but not necessarily to a pre-defined goal) and gained 5,000 metres (16,000?ft) in height. The FAI also issues a diploma for a flight of 1,000 kilometres (621?mi) and further diplomas for increments of 250 kilometres (155?mi).[54]\\r\\nIf lift is not found during a cross-country flight, for example because of deteriorating weather, the pilot must choose a location to \\"land out\\".[22] Although inconvenient and often mistaken for \\"emergency landings\\", landing out (or \\"outlanding\\") is a routine event in cross-country gliding. The pilot has to choose a location where the glider can be landed safely, without damaging the plane, the pilot, or property such as crops or livestock.[56] The glider and the pilot(s) can then be retrieved by road from the outlanding location using a purpose-built trailer. In some instances, a tow-plane can be summoned to re-launch the aircraft.\\r\\nAlthough adding to the weight and expense, some gliders are fitted with small power units and are known as motor gliders.[57] This avoids the inconvenience of landing out. The power units can be internal combustion engines, electrical motors, or retractable jet engines. Retractable propellers are fitted to high performance sailplanes, though in another category, called touring motor gliders, non-retractable propellers are used. Some powered gliders are \\"self launching\\", which makes the glider independent of a tow plane. However some gliders have \\"sustainer\\" engines that can prolong flight but are not powerful enough for launching. All power units have to be started at a height that includes a margin that would still allow a safe landing out to be made, if there were a failure to start.[24]:130[58]\\r\\nIn a competition, using the engine ends the soaring flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, as they do not need a safety margin for starting the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot.[59] Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.\\r\\nWorld and European Aerobatic competitions are held regularly.[60] In this type of competition, the pilots fly a program of maneuvers (such as inverted flight, loop, roll, and various combinations). Each maneuver has a rating called the \\"K-Factor\\".[61] Maximum points are given for the maneuver if it is flown perfectly; otherwise, points are deducted. Efficient maneuvers also enable the whole program to be completed with the height available. The winner is the pilot with the most points.[62]\\r\\nUnlike hang gliders and paragliders, gliders surround the pilots with strong structures and have undercarriages to absorb impacts when landing. These features prevent injuries from otherwise minor incidents, [63][64] but there are some hazards. Although training and safe procedures are central to the ethos of the sport, a few fatal accidents occur every year, almost all caused by pilot error.[64] In particular there is a risk[65] of mid-air collisions between gliders, because two pilots might choose to fly to the same area of lift and so might collide. Because of this risk, pilots usually wear parachutes. To avoid other gliders and general aviation traffic, pilots must comply with the Rules of the Air and keep a good lookout. In several European countries and Australia, the FLARM warning system is used to help avoid mid-air collisions between gliders.[66] A few modern gliders have a ballistic emergency parachute to stabilize the aircraft after a collision.[67]\\r\\nIn addition to national laws controlling aviation, the sport in many countries is regulated through national gliding associations and then through local gliding clubs. Much of the regulation concerns safety and training.\\r\\nMany clubs provide training for new pilots. The student flies with an instructor in a two-seat glider fitted with dual controls. The instructor performs the first launches and landings, typically from the back seat, but otherwise the student manages the controls until the student is deemed to have the skill and the airmanship necessary to fly solo.[68] Simulators are also beginning to be used in training, especially during poor weather.[69]\\r\\nAfter the first solo flights glider pilots are required to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.[70]\\r\\nIn addition to the regulation of pilots, gliders are inspected annually and after exceeding predetermined flight times. Maximum and minimum payloads are also defined for each glider. Because most gliders are designed to the same specifications of safety, the upper weight limit for a pilot, after allowing for a parachute, is usually 103 kilograms (227?lb). There is also a limit, 193 centimetres (6?ft 4?in), on the tallest pilots who can safely fit into a typical glider's cockpit.[71]\\r\\nAccording to the FAI President, gliding as a sport faces challenges in the years ahead.[72] These include:\\r\\nThe two air sports that are most closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are significant differences which are listed in detail in a comparison of sailplanes hang gliders and paragliders. The main difference is that both hang gliders and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage.[81] All paragliders and most hang gliders have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example, hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air.[82] The airspeeds and glide ratios of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.[83]","input":"How long do gliders stay in the air?"},{"output":"sacrificial victims","context":"Monte Albn is a large pre-Columbian archaeological site in the Santa Cruz Xoxocotln Municipality in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca (17.043 N, 96.767W). The site is located on a low mountainous range rising above the plain in the central section of the Valley of Oaxaca where the latter's northern Etla, eastern Tlacolula, and southern Zimatln & Ocotln (or Valle Grande) branches meet. The present-day state capital Oaxaca City is located approximately 9?km (6?mi) east of Monte Albn.\\r\\nThe partially excavated civic-ceremonial center of the Monte Albn site is situated atop an artificially-leveled ridge, which with an elevation of about 1,940?m (6,400?ft) above mean sea level rises some 400?m (1,300?ft) from the valley floor, in an easily defensible location. In addition to the monumental core, the site is characterized by several hundred artificial terraces, and a dozen clusters of mounded architecture covering the entire ridgeline and surrounding flanks.[1] The archaeological ruins on the nearby Atzompa and El Gallo hills to the north are traditionally considered to be an integral part of the ancient city as well.\\r\\nBesides being one of the earliest cities of Mesoamerica, Monte Albn's importance stems also from its role as the pre-eminent Zapotec socio-political and economic center for close to a thousand years. Founded toward the end of the Middle Formative period at around 500 BC, by the Terminal Formative (ca.100 BC-AD 200) Monte Albn had become the capital of a large-scale expansionist polity that dominated much of the Oaxacan highlands and interacted with other Mesoamerican regional states such as Teotihuacan to the north (Paddock 1983; Marcus 1983). The city had lost its political pre-eminence by the end of the Late Classic (ca. AD 500-750) and soon thereafter was largely abandoned. Small-scale reoccupation, opportunistic reutilization of earlier structures and tombs, and ritual visitations marked the archaeological history of the site into the Colonial period.\\r\\nThe etymology of the site's present-day name is unclear, and tentative suggestions regarding its origin range from a presumed corruption of a native Zapotec name to a colonial-era reference to a Spanish soldier by the name Montalbn or to the Alban Hills of Italy. The ancient Zapotec name of the city is not known, as abandonment occurred centuries before the writing of the earliest available ethnohistorical sources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing visible from anywhere in the central part of the Valley of Oaxaca, the impressive ruins of Monte Albn attracted visitors and explorers throughout the colonial and modern eras. Among others, Guillermo Dupaix investigated the site in the early 19th century CE, J. M. Garca published a description of the site in 1859, and A. F. Bandelier visited and published further descriptions in the 1890s. A first intensive archaeological exploration of the site was conducted in 1902 by Leopoldo Batres, then General Inspector of Monuments for the Mexican government under Porfirio Diaz.[2] It was however only in 1931 that large-scale scientific excavations were undertaken under the direction of Mexican archaeologist Alfonso Caso. In 1933, Eulalia Guzmn assisted with the excavation of Tomb 7.[3] Over the following eighteen years Caso and his colleagues Ignacio Bernal and Jorge Acosta excavated large sections within the monumental core of the site, and much of what is visible today in areas open to the public was reconstructed at that time. Besides resulting in the excavation of a large number of residential and civic-ceremonial structures and hundreds of tombs and burials, one lasting achievement of the project by Caso and his colleagues was the establishment of a ceramic chronology (phases Monte Albn I through V) for the period between the site's founding in ca. 500 BCE to end of the Postclassic period in CE 1521.\\r\\nThe investigation of the periods preceding Monte Albn's founding was a major focus of the Prehistory and Human Ecology Project started by Kent Flannery of the University of Michigan in the late 1960s. Over the following two decades this project documented the development of socio-political complexity in the valley from the earliest Archaic period (ca. 8000-2000 BCE) to the Rosario phase (700-500 BCE) immediately preceding Monte Albn, thus setting the stage for an understanding of the latter's founding and developmental trajectory. In this context, among the major accomplishments of Flannery's work in Oaxaca are his extensive excavations at the important formative center of San Jos Mogote in the Etla branch of the valley, a project co-directed with Joyce Marcus of the University of Michigan.[4][5]\\r\\nA further important step in the understanding of the history of occupation of the Monte Albn site was reached with the Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the Valley of Oaxaca Project begun by Richard Blanton and several colleagues in the early 1970s. It is only with their intensive survey and mapping of the entire site that the real extension and size of Monte Albn beyond the limited area explored by Caso became known.[1] Subsequent seasons of the same project under the direction of Blanton, Gary Feinman, Steve Kowalewski, Linda Nicholas, and others extended the survey coverage to practically the entire valley, producing an invaluable amount of data on the region's changing settlement patterns from the earliest times to the arrival of the Spanish in CE 1521.[6][7]\\r\\nAs indicated by Blanton's survey of the site, the Monte Albn hills appear to have been uninhabited prior to 500 BCE (the end of the Rosario ceramic phase). At that time, San Jos Mogote was the major population center in the valley and head of a chiefdom that likely controlled much of the northern Etla branch.[5] Perhaps as many as three or four other smaller chiefly centers controlled other sub-regions of the valley, including Tilcajete in the southern Valle Grande branch and Yegih in the Tlacolula arm to the east. Competition and warfare seem to have characterized the Rosario phase, and the regional survey data suggests the existence of an unoccupied buffer zone between the San Jos Mogote chiefdom and those to the south and east.[5] It is within this no-man's land that at the end of the Rosario period Monte Albn was founded, quickly reaching a population estimate of around 5,200 by the end of the following Monte Albn Ia phase (ca.300 BCE). This remarkable population increase was accompanied by an equally rapid decline at San Jos Mogote and neighbouring satellite sites, making it likely that its chiefly elites were directly involved in the founding of the future Zapotec capital. This rapid shift in population and settlement, from dispersed localized settlements to a central urban site in a previously unsettled area, has been referred to as the Monte Alban Synoikism by Marcus and Flannery[5]:140-146 in reference to similar recorded instances in the Mediterranean area in antiquity. Although it was previously thought[1] that a similar process of large-scale abandonment, and thus participation in the founding of Monte Albn, occurred at other major chiefly centers such as Yegih and Tilcajete, at least in the latter's case this now appears to be unlikely. A recent project directed by Charles Spencer and Elsa Redmond of the American Museum of Natural History in New York has shown that rather than being abandoned the site actually grew significantly in population during the periods Monte Albn Early I and Late I (ca. 500-300 BCE and 300-100 BCE, respectively) and might have actively opposed incorporation into the increasingly powerful Monte Albn state.[8]\\r\\nBy the beginning of the Terminal Formative (Monte Albn II phase, ca. 100 BCE-CE 200) Monte Albn had an estimated population of 17,200,[5]:139 making it one of the largest Mesoamerican cities at the time. The city has excellent views all the way around. As its political power grew, Monte Albn expanded militarily, through cooption, and via outright colonization into several areas outside the Valley of Oaxaca, including the Ca?ada de Cuicatln to the north and the southern Ejutla and Sola de Vega valleys.[9][10][11](Feinman and Nicholas 1990) During this period and into the subsequent Early Classic (Monte Albn IIIA phase, ca. CE 200-500) Monte Albn was the capital of a major regional polity that exerted a dominating influence over the Valley of Oaxaca and across much of the Oaxacan highlands. As mentioned earlier, evidence at Monte Albn is suggestive of high-level contacts between the site's elites and those at the powerful central Mexican city of Teotihuacan, where archaeologists have identified a neighbourhood inhabited by ethnic Zapotecs from the valley of Oaxaca (Paddock 1983). By the Late Classic (Monte Albn IIIB/IV, ca. CE 500-1000) the site's influence outside and inside the valley declined, and elites at several other centers, once part of the Monte Albn state, began to assert their autonomy, including sites such as Cuilapan and Zaachila in the Valle Grande and Lambityeco, Mitla, and El Palmillo in the eastern Tlacolula arm. The latter is the focus of an ongoing project by Gary Feinman and Linda Nicholas of Chicago's Field Museum (Feinman and Nicholas 2002). By the end of the same period (ca. AD 900-1000) the ancient capital was largely abandoned, and the once powerful Monte Albn state was replaced by dozens of competing smaller polities, a situation that lasted up to the Spanish conquest.[12]\\r\\nThe monumental center of Monte Albn is the Main Plaza, which measures approximately 300 meters by 200 meters. The site's main civic-ceremonial and elite-residential structures are located around it or in its immediate vicinity, and most of these have been explored and restored by Alfonso Caso and his colleagues. To the north and south the Main Plaza is delimited by large platforms accessible from the plaza via monumental staircases. On its eastern and western sides the plaza is similarly bounded by a number of smaller platform mounds on which stood temples and elite residences, as well as one of two ballcourts known to have existed at the site. A north-south spine of mounds occupies the center of the plaza and similarly served as platforms for ceremonial structures.\\r\\nOne characteristic of Monte Albn is the large number of carved stone monuments one encounters throughout the plaza. The earliest examples are the so-called \\"Danzantes\\" (literally, dancers), found mostly in the vicinity of Building L and which represent naked men in contorted and twisted poses, some of them genitally mutilated. The figures are said to represent sacrificial victims, which explains the morbid characteristics of the figures. The Danzantes feature physical traits characteristic of Olmec culture.[13] The 19th century notion that they depict dancers is now largely discredited, and these monuments, dating to the earliest period of occupation at the site (Monte Albn I), are now seen to clearly represent tortured, sacrificed war prisoners, some identified by name, and may depict leaders of competing centers and villages captured by Monte Albn.[5](Blanton et al. 1996) Over 300 Danzantes stones have been recorded to date, and some of the better preserved ones can be viewed at the site's museum. There is some indication that the Zapotecs had writing and calendrical notation.\\r\\nA different type of carved stones is found on the nearby Building J in the center of the Main Plaza, a building characterized by an unusual arrow-like shape and an orientation that differs from most other structures at the site. Inserted within the building walls are over 40 large carved slabs dating to Monte Albn II and depicting place-names, occasionally accompanied by additional writing and in many cases characterized by upside-down heads. Alfonso Caso was the first to identify these stones as \\"conquest slabs\\", likely listing places the Monte Albn elites claimed to have conquered and/or controlled. Some of the places listed on Building J slabs have been tentatively identified, and in one case (the Ca?ada de Cuicatln region in northern Oaxaca) Zapotec conquest has been confirmed through archaeological survey and excavations.[10][11]\\r\\nThe site of Monte Alban contains several pieces of evidence through the architecture of the site to suggest that there was social stratification within the settlement. Walls that were as large as nine meters tall and twenty meters wide were built around the settlement and would have been used not only to create a boundary between Monte Alban and neighboring settlements but also prove the power of the elites within the community. In Scott Hutsons analysis of the relationships between the commoners and the elites in Monte Alban he notes that the monumental mounds that were found in the site seemed to be evenly spaced throughout the site so that each house would be close enough to a mound that it could easily be kept under surveillance. Hutson also makes note that over time the style of houses seem to have changed to become more private to those living in the buildings making it harder for information to be obtained by outsiders. These changes to the ability of the elites to gain information about the private lives of its citizens would have played a key role in the internal political structure of the settlement.[14]\\r\\nMany of the artifacts excavated at Monte Albn in over a century of archaeological exploration can be seen at the Museo Nacional de Antropologia in Mexico City and at the Museo Regional de Oaxaca in the ex-convento de Santo Domingo de Guzmn in Oaxaca City. The latter museum houses, among others, many of the objects discovered in 1932 by Alfonso Caso in Monte Albn's Tomb 7, a Classic period Zapotec tomb that was opportunistically reused in Postclassic times for the burial of Mixtec elite individuals. Their burial was accompanied by some of the most spectacular burial offerings of any site in the Americas.[15]\\r\\nMonte Albn is a popular tourist destination for visitors to Oaxaca and has a small site museum mostly displaying original carved stones from the site. The site received 429,702 visitors in 2017.[16]\\r\\nThe primary threat to this archaeological site is urban growth that is encroaching and \\"threatening to expand into territories that have potential archaeological value.\\"[17] To complicate matters, the administration of the site is divided amongst four different municipalities, making a unified effort to stop the urban encroachment challenging.[17]\\r\\nAltar\\r\\nUnrestored section of Monte Albn with Oaxaca City in the background\\r\\nView of Main Plaza from the South Platform, with Building J in the foreground.\\r\\nOne of the stelae known as Dancing by unorthodox positions of the characters represented.\\r\\nPlan of Monte Alban's System IV structure, cut from a 3D laser scan image.\\r\\nImage of Monte Alban's System IV structure, taken from a 3D laser scan image.\\r\\nView across Main Plaza from the South Platform, with Building J in the foreground.\\r\\nBuilding M as seen from the South Platform.\\r\\nStones of the Dancers, in the Plaza of the Dancers, next to Building L.\\r\\nTomb north of the North Platform\\r\\nBuilding X on North Platform\\r\\nUnexcavated building on North Platform\\r\\nStone carvings, L\\r\\nView of Main Plaza from the North Platform\\r\\nCoordinates: 170238N 964604W? / ?17.04389N 96.76778W? / 17.04389; -96.76778","input":"What do the dazante figures from monte alban depict?"},{"output":"a solid, liquid or gaseous mixture that has the same proportions of its components throughout a given sample","context":"A homogeneous mixture is a solid, liquid or gaseous mixture that has the same proportions of its components throughout a given sample (or multiple samples of different proportion).

Solutions are homogeneous because the ratio of solute to solvent remains the same throughout the solution even if homogenized with multiple sources, and stable because the solute will not settle out after any period of time, and it cannot be removed by a filter or by centrifuge.[2] This type of mixture is very stable, i.e., its particles do not settle, or separate. As a homogeneous mixture, a solution has one phase (liquid) although the solute and solvent can vary: for example, salt water.\\r\\nAir can be more specifically described as a gaseous solution (oxygen and other gases dissolved in the major component, nitrogen).

Mixtures can be characterized by being separable by mechanical means e.g. heat, filtration, gravitational sorting, etc.[3]\\r\\nDuring the sampling of heterogeneous mixtures of particles, the variance of the sampling error is generally non-zero.

Howard","context":"The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, usually referred to as simply the Freedmen's Bureau,[1] was an agency of the United States Department of War to \\"direct such issues of provisions, clothing, and fuel, as he may deem needful for the immediate and temporary shelter and supply of destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen and their wives and children.\\" [2]\\r\\nThe Freedmen's Bureau Bill, which established the Freedmen's Bureau on March 3, 1865, was initiated by President Abraham Lincoln and was intended to last for one year after the end of the Civil War.[3] The Freedmen's Bureau was an important agency of early Reconstruction, assisting freedmen in the South. The Bureau was made a part of the United States Department of War, as it was the only agency with an existing organization that could be assigned to the South. Headed by Union Army General Oliver O. Howard, the Bureau started operations in 1865. Throughout the first year, its representatives learned that these tasks would be very difficult, as Southern legislatures passed laws for Black Codes that restricted movement, conditions of labor, and other civil rights of African Americans, nearly duplicating conditions of slavery. The Freedmen's Bureau controlled limited arable land.[4]\\r\\nThe Bureau's powers were expanded to help African Americans find family members from whom they had become separated during the war. It arranged to teach them to read and write, considered critical by the freedmen themselves as well as the government.[5][6] Bureau agents also served as legal advocates for African Americans in both local and national courts, mostly in cases dealing with family issues.[5] The Bureau encouraged former major planters to rebuild their plantations and urged freed blacks to return to work for them, kept an eye on contracts between the newly free laborers and planters, and pushed whites and blacks to work together as employers and employees rather than as masters and slaves.[5]\\r\\nIn 1866, Congress renewed the charter for the Bureau. President Andrew Johnson, a Southerner who had succeeded to the office following Lincoln's assassination, vetoed the bill because he believed that it encroached on states' rights, relied inappropriately on the military in peacetime, and would prevent freed slaves from becoming independent by offering too much assistance.[3][7] By 1869, the Bureau had lost most of its funding and as a result been forced to cut much of its staff.[3] By 1870 the Bureau had been considerably weakened due to the rise of Ku Klux Klan violence in the South.[3] In 1872, Congress abruptly abandoned the program, effectively shutting down the Bureau by refusing to approve renewal legislation. It did not inform Howard, who had been transferred to Arizona by President Ulysses S. Grant to settle hostilities between the Apache and settlers. Grant's Secretary of War William W. Belknap, was hostile to Howard's leadership and authority at the Bureau, and aroused controversy by his reassignment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bureau helped solve everyday problems of the newly freed slaves, such as obtaining clothing, food, water, health care, communication with family members, and jobs. It distributed 15 million rations of food to African Americans,[8] and set up a system where planters could borrow rations in order to feed freedmen they employed. Although the Bureau set aside $350,000 for this service, only $35,000 (10%) was borrowed by planters.[citation needed]\\r\\nDespite the good intentions, efforts, and limited success of the Bureau, medical treatment of the freedmen was severely deficient.[9] Most southern white doctors and nurses would not treat freedmen, infrastructure had been destroyed by the war, and people had few means of improving sanitation. Blacks had not had much opportunity to develop their own medical personnel. In this period epidemics of cholera and yellow fever were carried along the river corridors, breaking out across the South.\\r\\nFreedman's Bureau agents, at first, complained that freedwomen were refusing to contract their labor. One of the first actions black families took was to withdraw women's labor from fieldwork. The Bureau attempted to force freed women to work by insisting that their husbands sign contracts making the whole family available as field labor in the cotton industry, and by declaring that unemployed freed women should be treated as vagrants just as men were. The Bureau did allow some exceptions, such as married women with employed husbands, and some \\"worthy\\" women who had been widowed or abandoned and had large families of small children to care for. \\"Unworthy\\" women, meaning the unruly and prostitutes, were usually the ones subjected to punishment for vagrancy.[10]\\r\\nUnder slavery, most marriages had been informal, as slaveholders refused to acknowledge slave marriages and they were not legally recognized, although planters often presided over marriage ceremonies for their slaves. After the war, the Freedmen's Bureau performed numerous marriages for freed couples who asked for it. As many husbands and wives had been separated during wartime chaos, the Bureau agents helped families in their attempts to reunite after the war. The Bureau had an informal regional communications system that allowed agents to send inquiries and provide answers. It sometimes provided transportation to reunite families. Freedmen and freed women turned to the Bureau for assistance in resolving issues of abandonment and divorce.\\r\\nThe most widely recognized accomplishments of the Freedman's Bureau were in education. Prior to the Civil War, no southern state had a system of universal, state-supported public education and prohibited slaves and free blacks from gaining education. Former slaves wanted public education while the wealthier whites opposed the idea. Freedmen had a strong desire to learn to read and write; some started schools at refugee camps; others worked hard to establish schools in their communities even prior to the advent of the Freedmen's Bureau.\\r\\nOliver Otis Howard was appointed as the first Freedmen's Bureau Commissioner. Through his leadership the bureau set up four divisions: Government-Controlled Lands, Records, Financial Affairs, and Medical Affairs. Education was considered part of the Records division. Howard turned over confiscated property including planters' mansions, government buildings, books, and furniture to superintendents to be used in the education of freedmen, and provided transportation and room and board for teachers. Many Northerners came south to educate the freedmen.\\r\\nBy 1866, northern missionary and aid societies worked in conjunction with the Freedmen's Bureau to provide education for former slaves. The American Missionary Association was particularly active, establishing eleven colleges in southern states for the education of freedmen. The primary focus of these groups was to raise funds to pay teachers and manage schools, while the secondary focus was the day-to-day operation of individual schools. After 1866, Congress appropriated some funds to operate the freedmen's schools. The main source of educational revenue for these schools came through a Congressional Act that gave the Freedmen's Bureau the power to seize Confederate property for educational use.\\r\\nGeorge Ruby, an African American, served as teacher and school administrator and as a traveling inspector for the Bureau, observing local conditions, aiding in the establishment of black schools, and evaluating the performance of Bureau field officers. Blacks supported him, but planters and other whites opposed him.[11]\\r\\nOverall, the Bureau spent $5 million to set up schools for blacks. By the end of 1865, more than 90,000 former slaves were enrolled as students in such public schools. Attendance rates at the new schools for freedmen were between 79 and 82 percent. Brigadier General Samuel Chapman Armstrong created and led Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in Virginia in 1868. It is now known as Hampton University.\\r\\nThe Freedmen's Bureau published their own freedmen's textbook. They emphasized the bootstrap philosophy, encouraging freedmen to believe that each person had the ability to work hard and to do better in life.[clarification needed] These readers included traditional literacy lessons; as well as selections on the life and works of Abraham Lincoln, excerpts from the Bible focused on forgiveness, biographies of famous African Americans with emphasis on their piety, humbleness and industry; and essays on humility, the work ethic, temperance, loving your enemies, and avoiding bitterness.[12]\\r\\nBy 1870, there were more than 1,000 schools for freedmen in the South.[13] J. W. Alvord, an inspector for the Bureau, wrote that the freedmen \\"have the natural thirst for knowledge,\\" aspire to \\"power and influence? coupled with learning,\\" and are excited by \\"the special study of books.\\" Among the former slaves, children and adults sought this new opportunity to learn. After the Bureau was abolished, some of its achievements collapsed under the weight of white violence against schools and teachers for blacks. After the 1870s, when white Democrats regained power of southern governments, they reduced funds available to fund public education, particularly for blacks. In the 1890s they passed a new state constitutions disenfranchising most blacks by creating barriers to voter registration. They passed Jim Crow laws establishing legal segregation of public places. Segregated schools and other services for blacks were consistently underfunded by the southern legislatures.[8]\\r\\nBy 1871, Northerners' interest in reconstructing the South with military power had waned. Northerners were beginning to tire of the effort that Reconstruction required, were discouraged at the high rate of continuing violence around elections, and were ready for the South to take care of itself. All of the southern states had created new constitutions that established universal, publicly funded education. Groups based in the North began to redirect their money toward universities and colleges founded to educate African-American leaders.\\r\\nAccounts by northern women and missionary societies resulted in historians believing that most Bureau teachers were well-educated women from the North, motivated by religion and abolitionism to teach in the South. In the 21st century, new research finds that half the teachers were southern whites; one-third were blacks (mostly southern), and one-sixth were northern whites.[14] Few were abolitionists; few came from New England. Men outnumbered women. The salary was the strongest motivation except for the northerners, who were typically funded by northern organizations and had a humanitarian motivation. As a group, the black cohort showed the greatest commitment to racial equality; and they were the ones most likely to remain teachers. The school curriculum resembled that of schools in the north.[15]\\r\\nThe building and opening of schools of higher learning for African Americans coincided with the shift in focus for the Freedmen's Aid Societies from supporting an elementary education for all African Americans to gaining a high school and college education for African-American leaders. Both of these events worked in concert with concern on the part of white officials working with African Americans in the South. These officials were concerned about the lack of a moral or financial foundation seen in the African-American community and traced that lack of foundation back to slavery.\\r\\nGenerally, they believed that blacks needed help to enter a free labor market and reconstruct stable family life. Heads of local American Missionary Associations sponsored various educational and religious efforts for African Americans. Later efforts for higher education were supported by such leaders as Samuel Chapman Armstrong of the Hampton Institute and Booker T. Washington of the Tuskegee Institute (from 1881). They said that black students should be able to leave home and \\"live in an atmosphere conducive not only to scholarship but to culture and refinement\\".[16]\\r\\nMost of these colleges, universities and normal schools combined what they believed were the best fundamentals of a college with that of the home, giving students a basic structure to build acceptable practices of upstanding lives. For instance, at the majority of these schools, students were expected to bathe a prescribed number of times per week, maintain an orderly living space, and present a particular appearance. At many of these institutions, Christian principles and practices were also part of the daily regime.\\r\\nDespite the untimely dissolution of the Freedman's Bureau, its legacy influenced the important historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), which were the chief institutions of higher learning for blacks in the South through the decades of segregation into the mid-20th century. Under the direction and sponsorship of the Bureau, together with the American Missionary Association in many cases, from approximately 1866 until its termination in 1872, an estimated 25 institutions of higher learning for black youth were established.[17] The leaders among them continue to operate as highly ranked institutions in the 21st century. (Examples include St. Augustine's College, Fisk University, Johnson C. Smith University, Clark Atlanta University, Dillard University, Shaw University, Virginia Union University, and Tougaloo College).\\r\\nAs of 2009[update], there exist approximately 105 HBCUs that range in scope, size, organization and orientation. Under the Education Act of 1965, Congress officially defined an HBCU as \\"an institution whose principal missions were and are the education of Black Americans\\". HBCUs graduate over 50% of African-American professionals, 50% of African-American public school teachers, and 70% of African-American dentists. In addition, 50% of African Americans who graduate from HBCUs go on to pursue graduate or professional degrees. One in three degrees held by African Americans in the natural sciences, and half the degrees held by African Americans in mathematics, were earned at HBCUs.[18]\\r\\nPerhaps the best known of these institutions is Howard University, founded in Washington, D.C., in 1867, with the aid of the Freedmen's Bureau. It was named for the commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau, General Oliver Otis Howard.[19]\\r\\nAfter the Civil War, control over existing churches was a contentious issue. The Methodist denomination had split into regional associations prior to the war. In some cities, Northern Methodists seized control of Southern Methodist buildings. Numerous northern denominations, including the independent black denominations of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) and African Methodist Episcopal Zion, sent missionaries to the South to help the freedmen. By this time the independent black denominations were increasingly well organized and prepared to evangelize to the freedmen. Within a decade, the AME and AME Zion churches had gained hundreds of thousands of new members and were rapidly organizing new congregations.[20]\\r\\nEven before the war, blacks had established independent Baptist congregations in some cities and towns, such as Silver Bluff, Charleston, Petersburg, and Richmond. In many places, especially in more rural areas, they shared public services with whites. Often enslaved blacks met secretly to conduct their own services away from white supervision or oversight.[20] After the war, freedmen mostly withdrew from the white-dominated congregations of the Baptist, Methodist and Presbyterian churches in order to be free to worship as they pleased away from white supervision. Within a short time, they were organizing black Baptist state association, and organized a national association in the 1890s.\\r\\nNorthern mission societies raised funds for land, buildings, teachers' salaries, and basic necessities such as books and furniture. For years they used networks throughout their churches to raise money for freedmen's education and worship.[21]\\r\\nMost of the assistant commissioners, realizing that African Americans would not receive fair trials in the civil courts, tried to handle black cases in their own Bureau courts. Southern whites objected that this was unconstitutional. In Alabama, state and county judges were commissioned as Bureau agents. They were to try cases involving blacks with no distinctions on racial grounds. If a judge refused, martial law could be instituted in his district. All but three judges accepted their unwanted commissions, and the governor urged compliance.[22]\\r\\nPerhaps the most difficult region was Louisiana's Caddo-Bossier Parish. It had not experienced wartime devastation or Union occupation. Understaffed and weakly supported by federal troops, well-meaning Bureau agents found their investigations blocked and authority undermined at every turn by recalcitrant plantation owners. Murders of freedmen were common, and suspects in these cases went unprosecuted. Bureau agents did negotiate labor contracts, build schools and hospitals, and aid freedmen, but they struggled against the oppressive environment.[23]\\r\\nIn March 1872, at the request of President Ulysses S. Grant and the Secretary of the Interior, Columbus Delano, General Howard was asked to temporarily leave his duties as Commissioner of the Bureau to deal with Indian affairs in the west. Upon returning from his assignment in November 1872, General Howard discovered that the Bureau and all of its activities had been officially terminated by Congress, effective as of June (Howard, 1907). While General Howard was dealing with Indian affairs in the west, the Freedmen's Bureau was steadily losing its support. During the Bureau's first year, Congress appropriated no money for the Bureau so it was forced to rely on the army for financial support. Because the Bureau had a lack of funding from the federal government, it was unable to carry out all of its initiatives to sustain the lives of the newly freed slaves and to ensure any real measure of racially equality. [24]President Johnson was also opposed to the Freedmen's Bureau and his opposition encouraged many people, especially white southerners, to challenge the Bureau. Congress was forced to dismantle the Bureau in 1872 due to pressure from white Southerners. In the South there was a never ending struggle to get the whites and blacks to work together and unfortunately, the Bureau was unable to change that.[25] In his autobiography, General Howard expressed great frustration in regard to what had taken place without his knowledge, stating \\"the legislative action, however, was just what I desired, except that I would have preferred to close out my own Bureau and not have another do it for me in an unfriendly manner in my absence.\\"[26] All documents and matters pertaining to the Freedmen's Bureau were transferred from the office of General Howard to the War Department of the United States Congress.\\r\\nThe Bureau began distributing rations in the summer of 1865. Drought conditions resulted in so much need that the state established its own Office of the Commissioner of the Destitute to provide additional relief. The two agencies coordinated their efforts starting in 1866. The Bureau established depots in eight major cities. Counties were allocated aid in kind each month based on the number of poor reported. The counties then were required to transport the supplies themselves. The ration was larger in winter and spring, and reduced in seasons when locally-grown food was available.\\r\\nIn 1866, the depot at Huntsville provided five thousand rations a day. The food was distributed without regard to race. Corruption and abuse was so great that in October 1866, the President ended in-kind aid in that state. One hundred twenty thousand dollars was given to the state to provide relief to the end of January 1867. Aid then ended in the state.\\r\\nRecords show that at the end of the program, four times more White people received aid than did Black people.[27]\\r\\nThe Florida Bureau was assessed to be working effectively. Col. T. W. Osborne, the assistant commissioner of the Bureau for Florida, was an astute politician who collaborated with the leadership of both parties in the state. He was warmly praised by observers on all sides.[28][29]\\r\\nThe Bureau played a major role in Georgia politics.[30] It was especially active in setting up, monitoring, and enforcing labor contracts for both men and women.[31] It also set up a new system of healthcare for the freedmen.[32]\\r\\nIn North Carolina, the bureau employed: 9 contract surgeons, at $100 per month; 26 hospital attendants, at average pay each per month $11.25; 18 civilian employees, clerks, agents, etc., at an average pay per month of $17.20; 4 laborers, at an average pay per month of $11.90; enlisted men are detailed as orderlies, guards, etc., by commanding officers of the different military posts where officers of the Bureau are serving.[33]\\r\\nSome misconduct was reported to the bureau main office that bureau agents were using their posts for personal gains. Colonel E. Whittlesey was questioned but said he was not involved in nor knew of anyone involved in such activities. The bureau exercised what whites believed were arbitrary powers: making arrests, imposing fines, and inflicting punishments. They were considered to be disregarding the local laws and especially the statute of limitations. Their activities resulted in resentment among whites toward the federal government in general. These powers invoked negative feelings in many southerners that sparked many to want the agency to leave. In their review, Steedman and Fullerton repeated their conclusion from Virginia, which was to withdraw the Bureau and turn daily operations over to the military.[34]\\r\\nIn South Carolina, the bureau employed, nine clerks, at average pay each per month $108.33, one rental agent, at monthly pay of $75.00, one clerk, at monthly pay of $50.00, one storekeeper, at monthly pay of $85.00, one counselor, at monthly pay of $125.00, one superintendent of education, at monthly pay of $150.00, one printer, at monthly pay of $100.00, one contract surgeon, at monthly pay of $100.00, twenty-five laborers, at average pay per month $19.20.\\r\\nGeneral Saxton was head of the bureau operations in South Carolina; he was reported by Steedman and Fullerton to have made so many \\"mistakes and blunders\\" that he made matters worse for the freedmen. He was replaced by Brigadier General R.K. Scott. Steedman and Fullerton described Scott as energetic and a competent officer. It appeared that he took great pains to turn things around and correct the mistakes made by his predecessors.\\r\\nThe investigators learned of reported murders of freedmen by a band of outlaws. These outlaws were thought to be people from other states, such as Texas, Kentucky and Tennessee, who had been part of the rebel army (Ku Klux Klan chapters were similarly started by veterans in the first years after the war.) When citizens were asked why the perpetrators had not been arrested, many answered that the Bureau, with the support of the military, had the primary authority.[34]\\r\\nIn certain areas, such as the Sea Islands, many freedmen were destitute. Many had tried to cultivate the land and began businesses with little to no success in the social disruption of the period.[35]\\r\\nSuffering much less damage in the war than some other Deep South states, Texas became a destination for some 200,000 refugee blacks from other parts of the South, in addition to 200,000 already in Texas. Slavery had been prevalent only in East Texas, and some freedmen hoped for the chance of new types of opportunity in the lightly populated but booming state. The Bureau's political role was central, as was close attention to the need for schools.[36][37][38]\\r\\nThe Freedmen's Bureau had 58 clerks and superintendents of farms, paid average monthly wages $78.50; 12 assistant superintendents, paid average monthly wages 87.00; and 163 laborers, paid average monthly wages 11.75; as personnel in the state of Virginia. Other personnel included orderlies and guards.[34]\\r\\nDuring the war, slaves had escaped to Union lines and forts in the Tidewater, where contraband camps were established. Many stayed in that area after the war, seeking protection near the federal forts. The Bureau fed 9,000 to 10,000 blacks a month over the winter, explaining:\\r\\nIn 2000, the U.S. Congress passed the Freedmen's Bureau Preservation Act, which directed the National Archivist to preserve the extensive records of the Bureau on microfilm, and work with educational institutions to index the records.[40] In addition to those records of the Bureau headquarters, assistant commissioners, and superintendents of education, the National Archives now has records of the field offices, marriage records, and records of the Freedmen's Branch of the Adjutant General on microfilm. They are being digitized and made available through online databases. These constitute a major source of documentation on the operations of the Bureau, political and social conditions in the Reconstruction Era, and the genealogies of freedpeople.[41][42][a] The Freedmen's Bureau Project[44] (announced on June 19, 2015) was created as a set of partnerships between FamilySearch International and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society (AAHGS), and the California African American Museum. Tens of thousands of volunteers are needed to make these records searchable online. No specific time commitment is required, and anyone may participate. Volunteers simply log on (http://www.discoverfreedmen.org/), pull up as many scanned documents as they like, and enter the names and dates into the fields provided. Once published, information for millions of African Americans will be accessible, allowing families to build their family trees and connect with their ancestors. As of February 2016, the project was 51% complete.\\r\\nIn October 2006, Virginia governor Tim Kaine announced that Virginia would be the first state to index and digitize Freedmen's Bureau records.[45]","input":"He was the first head of the freedmens bureau?"},{"output":"Jack Torrance","context":"","input":"Who is the main character in the shining?"},{"output":"Hyderabad","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n^ϫ The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 states that Hyderabad is common capital of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states for a period of time not exceeding 10 years.^  Common for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. \\r\\n\\r\\nAndhra Pradesh (/??ndr? pr??d??/) (?pronunciation?(help{info)) is one of the 29 states of India. Situated in the south-east of the country, it is the eighth-largest state in India, covering an area of 162,970?km2 (62,920?sq?mi).[6] As per the 2011 census, it is the tenth most populous state, with 49,386,799 inhabitants. The largest city in Andhra Pradesh is Visakhapatnam.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 June 2014, the north-western portion of Andhra Pradesh was separated to form the new state of Telangana; the longtime capital of Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad, was transferred to Telangana as part of the division. However, in accordance with the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, Hyderabad was to remain as the de jure capital of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states for a period of time not exceeding ten years.[7] The new riverfront de facto capital, Amaravati, is under the jurisdiction of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndhra Pradesh has a coastline of 974?km (605?mi) ÿ the second longest coastline among the states of India, after Gujarat ÿ with jurisdiction over almost 15,000?km2 of territorial waters.[6][9] The state is bordered by Telangana in the north-west, Chhattisgarh and Odisha in the north-east, Karnataka in the west, Tamil Nadu in the south, and to the east lies the Bay of Bengal. The small enclave of Yanam, a district of Puducherry, lies to the south of Kakinada in the Godavari delta on the eastern side of the state.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state is made up of the two major regions of Rayalaseema, in the inland southwestern part of the state, and Coastal Andhra to the east and northeast, bordering the Bay of Bengal.[11] The state comprises thirteen districts in total, nine of which are located in Coastal Andhra and four in Rayalaseema. The largest city and commercial hub of the state is Visakhapatnam, located on the Bay of Bengal, with a GDP of US$43.5?billion; the second largest city in the state is Vijayawada, located on the banks of the Krishna River, which has a GDP of US$3?billion (as of 2010).[12][13] The economy of Andhra Pradesh is the seventh-largest state economy in India with ?8.70 lakh crore (US$130?billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of ?142,000 (US$2,100).[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndhra Pradesh hosted 121.8 million visitors in 2015, a 30% growth in tourist arrivals over the previous year,[15] making it the third most-visited state in India. The Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati is one of the world's most visited religious sites, with 18.25 million visitors per year.[16] Other pilgrimage centres in the state include the Mallikarjuna Jyotirlinga at Srisailam, the Srikalahasteeswara Temple at Srikalahasti, the Ameen Peer Dargah in Kadapa, the Mahachaitya at Amaravathi, the Kanaka Durga Temple in Vijayawada, and Prasanthi Nilayam in Puttaparthi. The state's natural attractions include the beaches of Visakhapatnam, hill stations such as the Araku Valley and Horsley Hills, and the island of Konaseema in the Godavari River delta.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tribe named Andhra was mentioned in Sanskrit texts such as Aitareya Brahmana (800ÿ500 BCE). According to Aitareya Brahmana of the Rig Veda, the Andhras left north India and settled in south India.[17][18][19] The Satavahanas have been mentioned by the names Andhra, Andhrara-jateeya and Andhrabhrtya in the Puranic literature.[20][21] They did not refer themselves as Andhra in any of their coins or inscriptions; it is possible that they were termed as Andhras because of their ethnicity or because their territory included the Andhra region.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeological evidence from places such as Amaravati, Dharanikota and Vaddamanu suggests that the Andhra region was part of the Mauryan Empire. Amaravati might have been a regional centre for Mauryan rule. After the death of Emperor Ashoka, Mauryan rule weakened around 200 BCE, and was replaced by several smaller kingdoms in the Andhra region.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Satavahana dynasty dominated the Deccan region from the 1st century BC to the 3rd century.[24] The later Satavahanas made Dharanikota and Amaravathi their capital, which according to the Buddhists is the place where Nagarjuna, the philosopher of Mahayana lived in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.[25] The Andhra Ikshvakus, with their capital at Vijayapuri, succeeded the Satavahanas in the Krishna River valley in the later half of the 2nd century.[26] Pallavas, who were originally executive officers under the Satavahana kings, were not a recognised political power before the 2nd century AD and were swept away by the Western Chalukyan invasion, led by Pulakesin II in the first quarter of the 7th century CE.[27] After the downfall of the Ikshvakus, the Vishnukundinas were the first great dynasty in the 5th and 6th centuries, and held sway over the entire Andhra country, including Kalinga and parts of Telangana. They played an important role in the history of Deccan during the 5th and 6th century CE, with Eluru, Amaravathi and Puranisangam.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Salankayanas were an ancient dynasty that ruled the Andhra region between Godavari and Krishna with their capital at Vengi (modern Pedavegi) from 300 to 440 CE.[29] The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, whose dynasty lasted for around five hundred years from the 7th century until 1130 C.E., eventually merged with the Chola empire. They continued to rule under the protection of the Chola empire until 1189 C.E., when the kingdom succumbed to the Hoysalas and the Yadavas.[30] The roots of the Telugu language have been seen on inscriptions found near the Guntur district and from others dating to the rule of Renati Cholas in the fifth century CE.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nKakatiyas ruled Andhra Pradesh state for nearly two hundred years and constructed several forts. They were succeeded by the Musunuri Nayaks.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reddy dynasty (1325ÿ1448 CE) was established by Prolaya Vema Reddi in the early 14th century, who ruled from present day Kondaveedu. Prolaya Vema Reddi was part of the confederation of states that started a movement against the invading Turkic Muslim armies of the Delhi Sultanate in 1323 CE and succeeded in repulsing them from Warangal.[33] They constructed Kondaveedu Fort which they ruled between 1328ÿ1428, before it was taken over by the Gajpathis of Orissa, and later ravaged by the Muslim rulers of the Bahmani kingdom in 1458. The Vijayanagara emperor Krishnadevaraya captured it in 1516. The Golconda Sultans fought for the fort in 1531, 1536 and 1579, and Sultan Quli Qutb Shah captured it in 1579, renaming it Murtuzanagar. Again it was reconquered by Vijayanagarans who overthrew sultanate rule across the entirety of modern-day Andhra Pradesh (excluding Telangana). After this rebellion, the Bahmani sultans launched no further military compaigns outside their kingdoms, because the Marathas soon emerged as the strongest power in India.[34][35][36] Efforts are in progress to classify Kondaveedu Fort as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[37][38] Pemmasani Nayaks, the greatest kings during Vijayanagara times ruled parts of Andhra Pradesh state with Gandikota as capital for nearly three hundred years.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vijayanagara Empire originated in the Deccan Plateau region in the early 14th century. It was established in 1336 by Harihara Raya I and his brother Bukka Raya I of the Sangama Dynasty.[40][41] The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form.[42] The Lepakshi group of monuments are culturally and archaeologically significant as it is the location of shrines dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Veerabhadra which were built during the Vijayanagara Kings' period (1336ÿ1646). The temples are the location of mural paintings of the Vijayanagara kings, dravidian art, and inscriptions. Near the temple complex is a large granite Nandi bull. On a hillock known as Kurma Saila ('tortoise shaped hill') are other temples to Papanatheswara, Raghunatha, Srirama, and Durga.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government of Andhra Pradesh has taken the initiative for including the \\"Lepakshi Group of Monuments\\" among the UNESCO World Heritage sites in India.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarihara and Bukka, who served as treasury officers of the Kakatiyas of Warangal, founded the Vijayanagara Empire.[47] In 1347 CE, an independent Muslim state, the Bahmani Sultanate, was established in south India by Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah in a revolt against the Delhi Sultanate. The Qutb Shahi dynasty held sway over the Andhra country for about two hundred years from the early part of the sixteenth century to the end of the seventeenth century.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early nineteenth century Northern Circars was ceded to the British East India Company and became part of the Madras Presidency. Eventually this region emerged as the Coastal Andhra region. Later the Nizam rulers of Hyderabad ceded five territories to the British that eventually became the Rayalaseema region. The Nizams retained control of the interior provinces as the princely state of Hyderabad, acknowledging British rule in return for local autonomy. However, Komaram Bheem, a tribal leader, started his fight against the erstwhile Asaf Jahi Dynasty for the liberation of Hyderabad State.[49] Meanwhile, the French occupied Yanam, in the Godavari delta, and (save for periods of British control) would hold it until 1954. In 1947 Vizianagaram was the largest Hindu princely state in Andhra Pradesh.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia became independent from the United Kingdom in 1947. The Nizam wanted to retain the independence of the Princely Hyderabad State from India, but the people of the region launched a movement to join the Indian Union. The state of Hyderabad was forcibly joined to the Republic of India with Operation Polo in 1948.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an effort to gain an independent state based on linguistic identity, and to protect the interests of the Telugu-speaking people of Madras State, Potti Sreeramulu fasted to death in 1952. As Madras became a bone of contention, in 1949 a JVP committee report stated \\"Andhra Province could be formed provided the Andhras give up their claim on the city of Madras (now Chennai)\\". After Potti Sreeramulu's death, the Telugu-speaking area of Andhra State was carved out of Madras State on 1 October 1953, with Kurnool as its capital city.[51] On the basis of the gentlemen's agreement of 1 November 1956, the States Reorganisation Act formed Andhra Pradesh by merging Andhra State with the Telugu-speaking areas of the already existing Hyderabad State.[52] Hyderabad was made the capital of the new state. The Marathi-speaking areas of Hyderabad State merged with Bombay State and the Kannada-speaking areas were merged with Mysore State.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2014, the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 bill was passed by the Parliament of India for the formation of the Telangana state comprising ten districts. Hyderabad will remain as a joint capital for not exceeding ten years.[7] The new state of Telangana came into existence on 2 June 2014 after approval from the President of India.[53] Number of petitions questioning the validity of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 are long pending for verdict since April 2014 before the supreme court constitutional bench.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state has varied topography ranging from the hills of Eastern Ghats and Nallamala Hills to the shores of Bay of Bengal that supports varied ecosystems, rich diversity of flora and fauna. There are two main rivers namely, Krishna and Godavari, that flow through the state. The seacoast of the state extends along the Bay of Bengal from Srikakulam to Nellore district.[55] The plains to the east of Eastern Ghats form the Eastern coastal plains. The coastal plains are for the most part of delta regions formed by the Godavari, Krishna, and Penner Rivers. The Eastern Ghats are discontinuous and individual sections have local names. The Eastern Ghats are a major dividing line in the state's geography. The Kadapa Basin[56][better?source?needed] formed by two arching branches of the Eastern Ghats is a mineral-rich area. The Ghats become more pronounced towards the south and extreme north of the coast. Most of the coastal plains are put to intense agricultural use. The Rayalaseema region has semi-arid conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Andhra Pradesh Forest Department deals with protection, conservation and management of forests. The total forest cover of the state after the bifurcation is left with an area of 22,862?km2.[57] The forest in the state can be broadly divided into four major biotic provinces.[58] They are:\\r\\n\\r\\nEastern Ghats region is home to dense tropical forests, while the vegetation becomes sparse as the Ghats give way to the Deccan Plateau, where shrub vegetation is more common. The vegetation found in the state is largely of dry deciduous types with a mixture of teak, Terminalia, Dalbergia, Pterocarpus, Anogeissus, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state has many sanctuaries, national parks and zoological parks, such as Coringa, Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary, Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Kambalakonda Wildlife Sanctuary, Sri Venkateswara Zoological Park and Indira Gandhi Zoological Park. Atapaka Bird Sanctuary, Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary and Pulicat Lake Bird Sanctuary attract many migratory birds.[59]\\r\\nThe state possesses some rare and endemic plants like Cycas beddomei, Pterocarpus santalinus, Terminalia pallida, Syzygium alternifolium, Shorea talura, Shorea tumburgia, Psilotum nudum, etc.[58] The diversity of fauna includes tigers, panthers, hyenas, black bucks, cheetals, sambars, sea turtles and a number of birds and reptiles. The estuaries of the Godavari and Krishna Rivers support rich mangrove forests with fishing cats and otters as keystone species.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climate of Andhra Pradesh varies considerably, depending on the geographical region. Summers last from March to June. In the coastal plain, the summer temperatures are generally higher than the rest of the state, with temperature ranging between 20?C and 41?C. July to September is the season for tropical rains. About one third of the total rainfall is brought by the northeast monsoon. October and November see low-pressure systems and tropical cyclones form in the Bay of Bengal which, along with the northeast monsoon, bring rains to the southern and coastal regions of the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovember, December, January, and February are the winter months in Andhra Pradesh.

Its border spanned three of Panama's provinces. When reservoirs were created to assure a steady supply of water for the locks, those lakes were included within the Zone.\\r\\nOn February 26, 1904, the Isthmian Canal Convention was proclaimed. In it, the Republic of Panama granted to the United States in perpetuity the use, occupation, and control of a zone of land and land under water for the construction, maintenance, operation, sanitation, and protection of the canal. From 1903 to 1979 the territory was controlled by the United States, which had purchased the land from the private and public owners, built the canal and financed its construction. The Canal Zone was abolished on October 1, 1979, as a term of the TorrijosÿCarter Treaties of 1977; the canal itself was under joint U.S.ÿPanamanian control from 1979 until it was fully turned over to Panama on December 31, 1999.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProposals for a canal across the Isthmus of Panama date back to 1529, soon after the Spanish conquest. lvaro de Saavedra Cer܇n, a lieutenant of conquistador Vasco N~?ez de Balboa, suggested four possible routes, one of which closely tracks the present-day canal. Saavedra believed that such a canal would make it easier for European vessels to reach Asia. Although King Charles I was enthusiastic and ordered preliminary works started, his officials in Panama soon realized that such an undertaking was beyond the capabilities of 16th-century technology. One official wrote to Charles, \\"I pledge to Your Majesty that there is not a prince in the world with the power to accomplish this\\".[3] The Spanish instead built a road across the isthmus. The road came to be crucial to Spain's economy, as treasure obtained along the Pacific coast of South America was offloaded at Panama City and hauled through the jungle to the Atlantic port of Nombre de Dios, close to present day Col܇n.[4] Although additional canal building proposals were made throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, they came to naught.[3]\\r\\nThe late 18th and early 19th centuries saw a number of canals built. The success of the Erie Canal in the United States and the collapse of the Spanish Empire in Latin America led to a surge of American interest in building an interoceanic canal. Beginning in 1826, US officials began negotiations with New Granada (present-day Colombia and Panama), hoping to gain a concession for the building of a canal. Jealous of their newly obtained independence and fearing that they would be dominated by an American presence, New Granadan officials declined American offers. The new nation was politically unstable, and Panama rebelled several times during the 19th century.[5]\\r\\nIn 1836, U.S. statesman Charles Biddle reached an agreement with the New Granadan government to replace the old road with an improved one or a railroad, running from Panama City on the Pacific coast to the Chagres River, where a steamship service would allow passengers and freight to continue to Col܇n. His agreement was repudiated by the Jackson administration, which wanted rights to build a canal. In 1841, with Panama in rebellion again, British interests secured a right of way over the isthmus from the insurgent regime and occupied Nicaraguan ports that might have served as the Atlantic terminus of a canal.[6][7] In 1846, the new US envoy to Bogot, Benjamin Bidlack, was surprised when, soon after his arrival, the New Granadans proposed that the United States be the guarantor of the neutrality of the isthmus. The resulting MallarinoÿBidlack Treaty allowed the United States to intervene militarily to ensure that the interoceanic road (and when it was built, the Panama Railroad as well) would not be disrupted. New Granada hoped that other nations would sign similar treaties, but the one with the United States, which was ratified by the US Senate in June 1848 after considerable lobbying by New Granada, was the only one.[8]\\r\\nThe treaty led the U.S. government to contract for steamship service to Panama from ports on both coasts. When the California Gold Rush began in 1848, traffic through Panama greatly increased, and New Granada agreed to allow the Panama Railroad to be constructed by American interests. This first \\"transcontinental railroad\\" opened in 1850.[9] There were riots in Panama City in 1856; several Americans were killed. US warships landed Marines, who occupied the railroad station and kept the railroad service from being interrupted by the unrest. The United States demanded compensation from New Granada, including a zone 20 miles (32?km) wide, to be governed by US officials and in which the United States might build any \\"railway or passageway\\" it desired. The demand was dropped in the face of resistance by New Granadan officials, who accused the United States of seeking a colony.[10]\\r\\nThrough the remainder of the 19th century, the United States landed troops several times to preserve the railway connection. At the same time, it pursued a canal treaty with Colombia (as New Granada was renamed). One treaty, signed in 1868, was rejected by the Colombian Senate, which hoped for better terms from the incoming Grant administration. Under this treaty, the canal would have been in the middle of a 20-mile zone, under American management but Colombian sovereignty, and the canal would revert to Colombia in 99?years. The Grant administration did little to pursue a treaty, and in 1878, the concession to build the canal fell to a French firm. The French efforts eventually failed, but with Panama apparently unavailable, the United States considered possible canal sites in Mexico and Nicaragua.[11]\\r\\nThe SpanishÿAmerican War of 1898 added new life to the canal debate. During the war, American warships in the Atlantic seeking to reach battle zones in the Pacific had been forced to round Cape Horn. Influential naval pundits, such as Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, urged the construction of a Central American canal. In 1902, with the French efforts moribund, US President Theodore Roosevelt backed the Panama route, and Congress passed legislation authorizing him to purchase the French assets[12] on the condition that an agreement was reached with Colombia.[13] In March 1902, Colombia set its terms for such a treaty: Colombia was to be sovereign over the canal, which would be policed by Colombians paid for by the United States. The host nation would receive a larger percentage of the tolls than provided for in earlier draft treaties. The draft terms were quickly rejected by American officials. Roosevelt was in a hurry to secure the treaty; the Colombians, to whom the French property would revert in 1904, were not. Negotiations dragged on into 1903, during which time there was unrest in Panama City and Col܇n; the United States sent in Marines to guard the trains. Nevertheless, in early 1903, the United States and Colombia signed a treaty which, despite Colombia's previous objections, gave the United States a 6 miles (9.7?km) wide zone in which it could deploy troops with Colombian consent. On August 12, 1903, the Colombian Senate voted down the treaty 24ÿ0.[14]\\r\\nRoosevelt was angered by the Colombians' actions, especially when the Colombian Senate made a counteroffer that was more financially advantageous to Colombia. A Frenchman who had worked on his nation's canal efforts, Philippe Bunau-Varilla, represented Panamanian insurgents; he met with Roosevelt and with Secretary of State John Hay, who saw to it that his principals received covert support. When the revolution came in November 1903, the United States intervened to protect the rebels, who succeeded in taking over the province, declaring it independent as the Republic of Panama. Bunau-Varilla was initially the Panamanian representative in the United States, though he was about to be displaced by actual Panamanians, and hastily negotiated a treaty, giving the United States a zone 20 miles (32?km) wide and full authority to pass laws to govern that zone. The Panama Canal Zone (Canal Zone, or Zone) excluded Panama City and Col܇n, but included four offshore islands, and permitted the United States to add to the zone any additional lands needed to carry on canal operations. The Panamanians were minded to disavow the treaty, but Bunau-Varilla told the new government that if Panama did not agree, the United States would withdraw its protection and make the best terms it could with Colombia. The Panamanians agreed, even adding a provision to the new constitution, at US request, allowing the larger nation to intervene to preserve public order.[15]\\r\\nThe treaty was approved by the provisional Panamanian government on December 2, 1903, and by the US Senate on February 23, 1904. Under the treaty, Panama received US$10 million, much of which the United States required to be invested in that country, plus annual payments of US$250,000; with those payments made, as well as for the purchase of the French company assets, the Canal Zone was formally turned over by Panama on May 4, 1904, when American officials reopened the Panama City offices of the canal company and raised the American flag.[16] This marked the beginning point for U.S. excavation and construction which concluded in August 1914 with the opening of the canal to commercial traffic.\\r\\nBy order of President Theodore Roosevelt under the Panama Canal Acts of 1902 and 1904 the Secretary of War was made supervisor of canal construction and the second Isthmian Canal Commission made the governing body for the Canal Zone.[17] Under the Panama Canal Act of May 24, 1912 President Woodrow Wilson issued Executive Order 1885, January 27, 1914, effective April 1, 1914 abolishing the previous governance placing it under the direction of the Secretary of War with the entity designated as The Panama Canal.[17][18] The Governor of the Panama Canal was charged with \\"completion, maintenance, operation, government and sanitation of the Panama Canal and its adjuncts and the government of the Canal Zone\\" in the Executive order.[18] A number of departments were specified in the order with others to be established as needed by the Governor of the Panama Canal with approval of the President and under the supervision of the Secretary of War.[18] Defense of the canal was the responsibility of the Secretary of War who retained control of troops with provisions for Presidential appointment of an Army officer in wartime who would have \\"exclusive authority over the operation of the Panama Canal and the Government of the Canal Zone.\\"[18] The Executive Order noted in closing \\"that the supervision of the operations of the Panama Canal under the permanent organization should be under the Secretary of War\\" thus establishing the essentially military arrangement and atmosphere for the canal and Canal Zone.[18]\\r\\nEffective July 1, 1951, under an act of Congress September 26, 1950 (64 Stat. 1038), governance of the Canal Zone was through the Canal Zone Government with the canal operated by the Panama Canal Company until 1979 when the Panama Canal Commission took over its governance.[19][20] The entire structure was under the control of the United States government with the Secretary of the Army appointing the Panama Canal Company board of directors and the Canal Zone Government was entirely financed by the company.[21] The office of Governor of the Panama Canal Zone was not usually a stepping stone to higher political office but a position given to a US Army active duty general officers of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.[22] The Governor was also President of the Panama Canal Company. The Canal Zone had its own police force (the Canal Zone Police), courts, and judges (the United States District Court for the Canal Zone).\\r\\nEveryone worked for the company or the government in one form or another. Residents did not own their homes; instead, they rented houses assigned primarily based on seniority in the zone. When an employee moved away, the house would be listed and employees could apply for it. The utility companies were also managed by the company. There were no independent stores; goods were brought in and sold at stores run by the company, such as a commissary, housewares, and so forth.\\r\\nIn 1952 the Panama Canal Company was required to go on a break-even basis in an announcement made in the form of the President's budget submission to the United States Congress.[23] Though company officials had been involved in previewing the requirement, there was no disclosure in advance, even though the Bureau of the Budget directed that the new rgime become effective on March 1.[23] The company organization was realigned into three main divisions; Canal Activity and Commercial Activity with the Service Activity providing services to both operating activities at rates sufficient to recover costs.[24] Rate adjustments in housing and other employee services would be required and a form of valuation, compared to a property tax, would be used to determine each division's contribution to the Canal Zone Government.[25]\\r\\nIn 1903, the United States, having failed to obtain from Colombia the right to build a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, which was part of that country, sent warships in support of Panamanian independence from Colombia. This being achieved, the new nation of Panama ceded to the Americans the rights they wanted in the HayÿBunau-Varilla Treaty. Over time, though, the existence of the Canal Zone, a political exclave of the United States that cut Panama geographically in half and had its own courts, police, and civil government, became a cause of conflict between the two countries. Demonstrations occurred at the opening of the Thatcher Ferry Bridge, now known as the Bridge of the Americas, in 1962 and serious rioting occurred in January 1964. This led to the United States easing its controls in the Zone. For example, Panamanian flags were allowed to be flown alongside American ones. After extensive negotiations, the Canal Zone ceased to exist on October 1, 1979, in compliance with provisions of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.\\r\\nDuring its construction and into the 1940s, the labor force in the Canal Zone (which was almost entirely publicly employed) was divided into a \\"gold\\" roll (short for payroll) classification, and a \\"silver\\" roll classification. The origins of this system are unclear, but it was the practice on the 19th-century Panama Railroad to pay Americans in US gold and local workers in silver coin.[26] Although some Canal Zone officials compared the gold roll to military officers and the silver roll to enlisted men, the characteristic that determined on which roll an employee was placed was race. With very few exceptions, American and Northern European whites were placed on the gold roll, and blacks and southern European whites on the silver roll. American blacks were generally not hired; black employees were from the Caribbean, often from Barbados and Jamaica. American whites seeking work as laborers, which were almost entirely silver roll positions, were discouraged from applying.[27] In the early days of the system, bosses could promote exceptional workers from silver to gold, but this practice soon ceased as race came to be the determining factor.[28] As a result of the initial policy, there were several hundred skilled blacks and southern Europeans on the gold roll.[29] In November 1906, Chief Engineer John Stevens ordered that most blacks on the gold roll be placed on the silver roll instead (a few remained in such roles as teachers and postmasters); the following month, the Canal Commission reported that the 3,700 gold roll employees were \\"almost all white Americans\\" and the 13,000 silver roll workers were \\"mostly aliens\\".[27] On February 8, 1908, President Roosevelt ordered that no further non-Americans be placed on the gold roll. After Panamanians objected, the gold roll was reopened to them in December 1908; however, efforts to remove blacks and non-Americans from the gold roll continued.[30]\\r\\nUntil 1918, when all employees began to be paid in US dollars, gold roll employees were paid in gold, in American currency, while their silver roll counterparts were paid in silver coin, initially Colombian pesos. Through the years of canal construction, silver roll workers were paid with coins from various nations; in several years, coin was imported from the United States because of local shortages. Even after 1918, both the designations and the disparity in privileges lingered.[29]\\r\\nUntil the end of World War II in 1945, the Panama Canal Zone operated under a Jim Crow society, where the category of \\"gold\\" represented white, U.S. workers and the title \\"silver\\" represented the non-white, non-U.S. workers on the Zone. After the strike of 1920, the Afro diasporic workers were banned from unionizing by the U.S. Canal officials. As a result, the Panama Canal West Indian Employees Association (PCWIEA) was created in 1924 to fill this vacuum of representation.[31] The PCWIEA did not garner much support on the Canal Zone because of its restrictive membership policies and the haunting of the 1920 strike and its damaging consequences. However, in 1946, the PCWIEA summoned the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) for representation and the establishment of a local union. In July of that year, the West Indian and Panamanian workers received a charter for Local 713 of the United Public Workers of America (UPWA)-CIO.[32][33] Together, with the assistance of U.S. representatives for the Local, these Afro-diasporic workers came together to secure material benefits in their livelihoods. They organized together in order to pose a serious threat to the Jim Crow system which resulted, however, only in minimal gains. The imperial system of the U.S. and its segregationist policies persisted as it related to housing and schooling.[34] In the end, ties to communism destroyed the UPWA and as a result Local 713 collapsed.[35] Nevertheless, it is important to see this as a moment of what Frank Gurridy describes as diasporization, diaspora in action, or the ways Afro-diasporic linkages were made in practice.[36] In the case of the Panama Canal Zone, these linkages were made not only by the West Indian and Panamanian communities, but also between the Afro descended workers on the Zone and African Americans, on the mainland of the U.S., through the transnational struggle to dismantle the system of Jim Crow.\\r\\nCanal Zone housing was constructed in the early days of construction, as part of Stevens' plans. Housing constructed for couples and families consisted of structures containing four two-story apartments. The units had corrugated-iron roofs, and were uniformly painted gray with white trim. Constructed of pine clapboard, they had long windows and high ceilings, allowing for air movement. Better-paid employees were entitled to more square feet of housing, the unit in which allowances were expressed. Initially, employees received one square foot per dollar of monthly salary. Stevens from the first encouraged gold roll employees to send for their wives and children; to encourage them to do so, wives were granted a housing allowance equal to their husband's, even if they were not employees. Bachelors mostly resided in hotel-like structures. The structures all had screened verandas and up-to-date plumbing. The government furnished power, water, coal for cooking, ice for iceboxes, lawn care, groundskeeping, garbage disposal, and, for bachelors only, maid service.[37]\\r\\nIn the first days of the Canal Zone, the ICC provided no food, and workers had to fend for themselves, obtaining poor-quality food at inflated prices from Panamanian merchants. When Stevens arrived in 1905, he ordered food to be provided at cost, leading to the establishment of the Canal Zone Commissary. The functions of the Commissary quickly grew, generally against the will of the Panamanian government, which saw more and more goods and services provided in the Zone rather than in Panama. Merchants could not compete with the commissary's prices or quality; for example, it boasted that the meat it sold had been refrigerated every moment from the Chicago slaughterhouse to the moment it was passed to the consumer. By 1913, it consisted of 22 general stores, 7 cigar stores, 22 hostels, 2 hotels, and a mail-order division. It served high-quality meals at small expense to workers and more expensive meals to upper-echelon canal employees and others able to afford it.[38]\\r\\nThe commissary was a source of friction between the Canal Zone and Panama for several other reasons. The commissary dominated sales of supplies to passing ships.[39] The commissary was off limits to individuals who were not in the U.S. Military, employees of the Panama Canal Company, the Canal Zone Government and/or their dependents. This restriction was requested by Panama for the benefit of Panamanian storekeepers, who feared the loss of trade. Panama had laws restricting imports from the Canal Zone. Goods from the commissary would sometimes show up in Panamanian stores and in vendor displays, where Comisariato goods were deemed of high quality.[40] Additionally, there were separate commissaries on the U.S. military installations that were available only to the U.S. Military personnel and their dependents. Employees and dependents of the Panama Canal Company/Government were not allowed to utilize the commissaries, exchanges, packages stores, theaters, gas stations, and other facilities on the U.S. Military installations.\\r\\nAlthough the Panama Canal Zone was legally a leased territory of the United States[41] until the implementation of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties in 1979, questions arose almost from its inception as to whether it was considered part of the United States for constitutional purposes, or, in the phrase of the day, whether the Constitution followed the flag. In 1901 the US Supreme Court had ruled in Downes v. Bidwell that unincorporated territories are not the United States.[42] On July 28, 1904, Controller of the Treasury Robert Tracewell stated, \\"While the general spirit and purpose of the Constitution is applicable to the zone, that domain is not a part of the United States within the full meaning of the Constitution and laws of the country.\\"[43] Accordingly, the Supreme Court held in 1905 in Rasmussen v. United States that the full Constitution only applies for incorporated territories of the United States.[44]\\r\\nThe treaty with Panama made no mention of the nationality status of the native inhabitants of the Zone. Pursuant to the principles of international law, they became non-citizen U.S. nationals unless they elected to retain their previous nationality. Children of non-citizen U.S. nationals generally acquired the status of their parents. However, for most nationality purposes, the Canal Zone was considered to be foreign territory and the status persons acquired at birth was governed by the Naturalization Act of 1795, which granted them statutory US citizenship at birth but only if their fathers were, at the time of the child's birth, U.S. citizens who had previously resided in the United States. In 1934 the law was amended to allow for citizenship to be acquired at birth through either parent if the parent was a U.S. citizen who had previously resided in the United States. In 1937 the law was further amended to provide for US citizenship to persons born in the Canal Zone (since 1904) to a U.S. citizen parent without that parent needing to have been previously resident in the United States.[41] The law is now codified under title 8, section 1403.[45] It not only grants statutory and declaratory born citizenship to those born in the Canal Zone after February 26, 1904, of at least one US citizen parent, but also does so retroactively for all children born of at least one US citizen in the Canal Zone before the law's enactment.[46] This rule was later rendered moot when the rules were changed to state that (almost all) children born to U.S. citizens anywhere in the world were considered U.S citizens.[47]\\r\\nIn 2008, during a minor controversy over whether Canal Zoneÿborn John McCain, born in the Zone in 1936, was legally eligible for the presidency, the US Senate passed a non-binding resolution that McCain was a \\"natural born Citizen\\" of the United States.[48]\\r\\nNotable people born in the Panama Canal Zone include\\r\\nDocumentary filmmaker Theo Uittenbogaard made a film about the Panama Canal zone, entitled 'The Treaty', which was released and aired on the Dutch national TV-channel VPRO in the series 'Machiavelli' in 1976.\\r\\nDocumentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman made a film about the Panama Canal Zone, entitled Canal Zone, which was released and aired on PBS in 1977.\\r\\nNo official statistics were ever collected. Stationing around the Canal were primarily Americans, who were mostly either Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish.\\r\\nThe Canal Zone was generally divided into two sections, the Pacific side and the Atlantic side, separated by Gatun Lake.\\r\\nA partial list of Canal Zone townships and military installations:\\r\\nOn 1 October 1979, the day the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 took effect, most of the land within the former Canal Zone transferred to Panama. However, the treaty set aside many Canal Zone areas and facilities for transfer during the following 20 years. The treaty specifically categorized areas and facilities by name as Military Areas of Coordination, \\"Defense Sites\\" and \\"Areas Subject to Separate Bilateral Agreement\\". These were to be transferred by the U.S. to Panama during certain time windows or simply by the end of the 243-month treaty period. On 1 October 1979, among the many such parcels so designated in the treaty, 35 emerged as enclaves (surrounded entirely by land solely under Panamanian jurisdiction). In later years as other areas were turned over to Panama, nine more enclaves emerged.\\r\\nAt least 13 other parcels each were enclosed partly by land under the absolute jurisdiction of Panama and partly by an Area of Civil Coordination\\" (housing), which under the treaty was subject to elements of both U.S. and Panamanian public law. In addition, the 1977 treaty designated numerous areas and individual facilities as Canal Operating Areas for joint U.S.-Panama ongoing operations by a commission. On the effective date of the treaty, many of these, including Madden Dam, became newly surrounded by the territory of Panama. Just after noon local time on 31 December 1999, all former Canal Zone parcels of all types had come under the exclusive jurisdiction of Panama.[50][51][52][53][54][55]\\r\\nThe 44 enclaves of U.S. territory that existed under the treaty are shown in the table below.\\r\\nThe Panama Canal Zone issued its own postage stamps from 1904 until October 25, 1978. After a transition period, Panama administered the stamps.\\r\\nThe two-letter state abbreviation for mail sent to the Zone was CZ.\\r\\nAmateur radio licenses were issued by the United States Federal Communications Commission and carried the prefix KZ5, the initial 'K' indicating a station under American jurisdiction. The American Radio Relay League had a Canal Zone section, and the Canal Zone was considered an entity for purposes of the DX Century Club. Contacts with Canal Zone stations from before repatriation may still be counted for DXCC credit separate from Panama.","input":"When did panama canal zone became a us territory?"},{"output":"Jack Dee","context":"Celebrity Big Brother 1, also referred to as Celebrity Big Brother 2001, was the first series of the British reality television show Celebrity Big Brother. The show is based on an originally Dutch TV series of the same name created by producer John de Mol in 1997.[1] In honour of Comic Relief, six celebrities entered the Big Brother house.\\r\\nThe series premiered on 9 March 2001, and lasted for a total of eight days. It concluded on 16 March 2001 when comedian Jack Dee was crowned the winner. The series revolved around a group of celebrities living in a custom built house with no contact with the outside world. Each week, the housemates are required to nominate two people for eviction. The two or more people with the most votes were nominated to leave the House. The viewers then decided which of the nominees should leave, with the selected person leaving during a live show. This process continued until only three housemates remained, at which time the public voted for which of them should win the series. Unlike the original show, Celebrity Big Brother saw the housemates competing for charity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series premiered on 9 March 2001, on Channel 4. The contestants were recorded 24 hours a day[2] with cameras fixed around the house, and had to wear portable microphones. Channel 4 broadcast a daily highlights show, and from the second day on there was a live eviction show hosted by Davina McCall, where the evicted housemate was interviewed. In the nightly highlight episodes, viewers are shown various highlights of a specific day in the house. Due to the length of the series, the psychologists featured in the main series did not return for Celebrity Big Brother 1, but did continue to appear in the main series. The series ended on 16 March, lasting for a total of 8 days. Initially, Celebrity Big Brother was meant to be a one-time series, but due to the success it was later brought back as an annual event, airing while the main series was completed. Celebrity Big Brother 1 was the first season in the UK edition of Big Brother to feature a live premiere, something that would be used from Big Brother 3 onward.\\r\\nThe six celebrities in the game are competing for charity, rather than a grand prize for themselves. While in the house, the housemates attempted to complete various tasks assigned by Big Brother in exchange for a grocery budget, which they used to buy food and luxuries; this included buying things such as alcohol and cigarettes. Celebrity Big Brother 1, much like the main series, did not feature luxury competitions or prizes throughout the season.\\r\\nFor the first season, Celebrity Big Brother used the house that was used in Big Brother 1, which was located in Bow, London near the 3 Mills Studios.[3] The House remained relatively unchanged from its appearance in the debut season. A living room was featured in the house, with blue walls lining it and the kitchen, which featured a stove and sink, along with the fridge. The house featured two nearly identical bedrooms, one for the men and one for the women. Each room featured five beds, with matching sheets and furniture. There was a shower room and toilet in the house as well. Housemates could communicate with producers in the room known was the \\"Diary Room\\". The Diary Room for the first season featured a simple design, being a small chair with a white background. Future seasons of the series would feature more elaborate Diary Rooms. The Diary Room was where nominations took place, and where housemates could reveal their thoughts. As seen in the third week, housemates could be seen by a medical professional in the Diary Room if necessary. The outside of the house featured a chicken coop with various chickens inside, from which the housemates collect eggs. Unlike other editions of the show, Big Brother 1 did not feature a swimming pool or hot tub for the housemates to use. There was also a garden in the backyard, which featured a vegetable patch which the housemates could use. Various two way mirrors are in the house, with a camera crew behind them. There are also various cameras and microphones throughout the house, providing the housemates with no privacy.\\r\\nBig Brother is a game show in which a group of contestants, called housemates, live in isolation from the outside world in a custom built \\"house\\", which includes everyday facilities such as a fully equipped kitchen, garden, two bedrooms, and a bathroom. The house is also a television studio with cameras and microphones in most of the rooms to record the activities of the housemates. The only place where housemates can escape the company of the other contestants is the Diary Room, where they are encouraged to voice their true feelings. Not all Diary Room footage is broadcast due to the privacy of the contestants. Each week all housemates nominate two of their fellow contestants for potential eviction. Failure to do so may result in a punishment, such as a reduction in the prize fund. The two, or more, housemates with the highest number of nominations face a public vote conducted by phone, with the contestant receiving the most votes being evicted from the house. The last contestant remaining in the house is declared the winner and will earn money for a charity. Big Brother host Davina McCall returned for Celebrity Big Brother to host the live premiere and eviction episodes. The eviction episodes remain largely unchanged from that of the main series.\\r\\nOver the duration of the series, the Housemates are given a series of tasks by Big Brother which test them in many ways. They are also put to the test by their own ideals, prejudices and opinions against other people from different walks of life; something that has survived from the original \\"social experiment\\" of Big Brother 1. They live in the communal House and share cooking and cleaning chores among themselves, which usually provides plenty of tension. Housemates are forbidden to sleep during daylight hours (unless unwell) - Big Brother plays the wake-up call persistently in the morning if housemates do not wake up and will play an alarm clock noise into the house if a housemate falls asleep during the day. Housemates must also live by the fundamental rules of Big Brother; if the rules are broken it can result in formal warnings, various punishments or even a housemate's removal from the House. They must wash their own clothes by hand, and they have to make their own bread from scratch. Each week Big Brother sets the Housemates a task in order to determine the shopping budget for the following week. They must work together to win the tasks in order to win a luxury shopping budget which changed based on the amount of people remaining in the house. If all food runs out in the House, Big Brother provides emergency rations of chickpeas and rice. Housemates are responsible for their own shopping and decide which items the budget will allow them to have. Only a small percentage of the overall budget can be spent on alcohol.\\r\\nOn Day 1, Anthea, Chris, Claire, Jack, Keith and Vanessa entered the Big Brother house. In a special twist, each Housemate made their nominations live on the launch episode. Every Housemate except for Vanessa had one vote cast against them. Ultimately, Chris and Anthea were selected as the first nominees of the season, with Anthea receiving three nominations and Chris receiving five, meaning everyone chose to nominate him. The first task, which began on Day 2, was for the housemates to customize a pair of pants for one of their fellow housemates. Later, the housemates performed a fashion show with their creations. Big Brother decided that they passed this task and, as a reward, Big Brother played Westlife's Comic Relief song into the house. During the day, Vanessa and Chris had an argument about parenting. This caused Vanessa to start shouting at Chris because of his actions towards her. That night, Chris was evicted from the house, having received 66% of the public vote to evict him.\\r\\nFollowing the eviction, the Housemates made their second round of nominations. This time, everyone excluding Claire received a nomination. Jack and Vanessa were announced as the new set of nominees, with Jack being nominated by everyone in the house and Vanessa receiving three nominations. After the nominations were announced, Vanessa took the news quite badly and began writing all over the kitchen table using chalk. The task on Day 3 had housemates memorize 10 facts about each other. Housemates were then each asked 3 questions at random later in the day. The Housemates passed this task, and gained S18 worth more shopping. The task on Day 4 was for the celebrity housemates to make a topiary model. Housemates passed this task, and won a film to watch. That night, Vanessa became the second evicted celebrity from the house, receiving 71% of the public vote.\\r\\nIn the third and final set of nominations, every Housemate received at least one nomination against them. The final nominations were announced as a three way tie between Anthea, Jack, and Keith. This made it Anthea and Jack's second time being nominated, while it was Keith's first time as a nominee. This also made Claire the only Housemate to make it to the finale this season without being nominated for eviction once. Claire also received the last amount of nominations in the game total, only getting three nominations total. The task on Day 5 was for housemates to write and perform an original song about their time in the house. Housemates passed the task and won a takeaway dinner. On Day 6, Housemates participated in a task which involved them taking part in an assault course. The Housemates completed the task in 3 minutes and 5 seconds, thus passing the task. That night, Anthea was evicted from the house, having received 52% of the public vote. While she was leaving the house, Jack ran outside to greet his wife, and was sent back inside. The Housemate's task on Day 7 was for each of them to take care of baby simulators called \\"Juanita\\" to test their parenting skills. Housemates passed and won a Wild West themed party. On Day 8, the final task was for housemates to paint their favorite view of the house, with the Housemates presenting these later in the day. That night, it was announced that Jack was the winner of Celebrity Big Brother 1, with Claire coming in second and Keith coming in third.\\r\\nCoordinates: 513139N 0011W? / ?51.52750N 0.00306W? / 51.52750; -0.00306","input":"Who won the first ever celebrity big brother?"},{"output":"January 3, 2018","context":"The eleventh season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files premiered on January 3, 2018, on Fox.[1] The season, consisting of ten episodes, follows newly re-instated Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). The season's storyline picks up directly after last season's finale and the search for Mulder and Scully's son William is the main story arc for the season.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDana Scully (Gillian Anderson) wakes up in the hospital after having a seizure, now realizing the events of My Struggle II were a vision and haven't actually happened yet. Mulder initially presumes Scullys ramblings are a product of her illness but leaves the hospital to investigate. Agent Jeffrey Spender later appears at Scullys bedside, revealing that someone is looking for William. He first balks at telling her the location of her son, revealing only the name of the family that adopted him - Van De Kamp. Mulder tails a henchman who he believes will take him to The Smoking Man, but he arrives somewhere else with mysterious conspirators; Mr. Y (A.C. Peterson) and Erika Price (Barbara Hershey). They try to negotiate with Mulder into turning over his son but Mulder refuses. Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tries to meet with Scully, but can't find her. As he goes to his car, he is met inside by The Smoking Man and Reyes. Meanwhile, Scully tries to leave the hospital but her seizures return causing her to crash her car. She is rescued by Agent Einstein and Agent Miller, and is readmitted to the hospital. Both agents leave the room. An assassin sent by Mr. Y and Erika enters and tries to suffocate Scully, but Mulder steps in and saves her by slicing the assassin's neck. As Skinner comes in, Mulder confronts him since he smells like smoke. In a flashback to when Skinner was in the car with the Smoking Man, the latter reveals (in a further flashback to 17 years, \\"En Ami\\") that he, not Mulder, artificially impregnated Scully.[3]\\r\\nScully opens her eyes in the dark, laying on her side on a bed in a mysterious house. She explores the mysterious house and ends up in a endless pattern of the same room. Mulder theorizes that the experience as a type of sleep paralysis. She goes back to her memories of her sleep paralysis, where she grabs a snow globe with a model of the boat in it. Mulder and Scully get to the dock, meeting with Detective Costa (Louis Ferreira). Later, Scullys attention is drawn to a man that observes them intently from one of the portable walkways. Costa informs them that the victims asked if they found Ghouli. When Scully turns to check if the mystery guy is there, hes gone. Both agents investigate the two teenagers about the slashing. Both of them go on about the experience and their boyfriend, Jackson Van De Kamp. The agents arrive at the Van De Kamp household, the same house Scully saw in her dream. Two gunshots are heard with a third coming from upstairs. Scully goes up and finds the bleeding corpse of Jackson Van De Kamp. As they leave the room and the door clicks closed, the zipper opens slowly. Jackson sits up and escapes the room. Mulder meets with Skinner at the Chimera, telling him to drop the investigation. Mulder confirms that Jackson's DNA matches Scully's. At the hospital, Jackson explains to Brianna that hes been hiding because there are people after him. He reveals that Ghouli doesn't exist and it's just something he \\"made up\\". Jackson escapes the hospital after the death of the DOD members. The next day, Scully spots a rural gas station that has a windmill just outside. Scully meets with Peter Wong with Wong mentioning that he wishes he could know her better. The agents ask to see the recording tapes. In the recording, Scully is having a conversation with William. She smiles as Mulder holds her while they see their son, alive.[4]\\r\\nEpisodes marked with a double dagger () are episodes in the series' alien mythology arc.[2]\\r\\nIn May 2015, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, co-star David Duchovny stated that if the 2016 revival were successful, he would be interested in another renewal, stating, \\"I would be open to doing another cycle. I don't know that I could do a 20-episode version of this show at this point in my life, and I don't know that Gillian could. But I think everybody is open ended on what happens after this. Certainly, we didn't bring it back with the idea of ending it.\\"[20] At the 2016 Television Critics Association panel for the series, creator Chris Carter stated, \\"If we do well in the ratings, I can't imagine we wouldn't be asked to do more.\\"[21] Fox Television Group chairman and CEO Gary Newman stated that he and fellow executive Dana Walden would be open to another renewal, stating, \\"We would love to do this again, so we'd be on board if schedules can be worked out.\\"[22] In an interview with Variety prior to the premiere, co-star Gillian Anderson, Duchovny, and Walden stated their willingness for another renewal.[23] In an interview with TV Guide, Carter reaffirmed plans for more episodes, but stressed that everyone involved is waiting on the success of the season.[24] In May 2016, Walden confirmed that there had been conversations about an eleventh season possibly for the 2017ÿ18 television season.[25]\\r\\nOn April 20, 2017, Fox officially announced that The X-Files would be returning for an eleventh season of ten episodes, which would air in the 2017ÿ18 television season after filming in mid-2017.[26]\\r\\nThe writing staff for the eleventh season consists of Chris Carter, Glen Morgan, Darin Morgan, James Wong, and newcomers who were all previously part of The X-Files production staff, Gabe Rotter (writers assistant), Benjamin Van Allen (writers assistant) and Brad Follmer (Carter's personal assistant).[27] In August 2017, it was announced that three female writers were added to the staff; Karen Nielsen (who worked as a script coordinator on season 10) wrote one episode, and Kristen Cloke and Shannon Hamblin wrote another episode based on a story by Glen Morgan.[28][29] The season, consisting of 10 episodes, has three mythology episodes and eight standalone episodes.[2]\\r\\nIn addition to Duchovny and Anderson, Mitch Pileggi was confirmed to reprise his role, as Walter Skinner.[30] Also returning are William B. Davis as Cigarette Smoking Man and Annabeth Gish as Monica Reyes.[2][31] In August 2017, it was confirmed that Robbie Amell and Lauren Ambrose would reprise their roles Agents Miller and Einstein from season ten.[32] In September 2017, it was announced that Karin Konovalÿwho played Mrs. Peacock in the fourth-season episode \\"Home\\"ÿwould play new characters in the eleventh season, in which Carter described as a \\"tour-de-force performance\\".[33] Anderson commented that this is her final season of The X-Files, saying, \\"I've said from the beginning this is it for me.\\"[34] However, Chris Carter affirmed he would not do The X-Files without her character, saying, \\"For me, The X-Files is Mulder and Scully. I think if it were without Scully, I wouldn't do it. That's not my X-Files.\\"[35] The writers intended to bring back Robert Patrick as his character John Doggett, but he was unavailable due to scheduling issues as he was filming for his TV series Scorpion.[36] In February 2018, Carter stated in an interview that he could see the show continuing without Anderson.[37]\\r\\nFilming began in August 2017 in Vancouver, British Columbia, where the previous season was filmed, along with the show's original five seasons.[38] After controversy sparked regarding the lack of female writers or directors on the series, it was announced in August 2017 that Carol Banker, a script supervisor on the original series who also directed an episode of The Lone Gunmen and Holly Dale were added as directors.[28]\\r\\nThe eleventh season has received generally positive reviews from critics and currently has a Metacritic score of 67 out of 100 based on 18 reviews.[39] On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 83% with an average rating of 6.99 out of 10 based on 30 reviews. The site's consensus reads, \\"Though it may not make many new believers, The X-Files' return to business as usual is a refreshing upgrade from the show's underwhelming previous outing.\\"[40]\\r\\nBased on the first five episodes available for review, Liz Shannon Miller of IndieWire gave the season a positive review with a \\"B+\\" grade. While Miller wrote that the season premiere \\"is not good\\", she was much more positive of the following four standalone episodes, writing that \\"there are some intriguing mysteries, some eerie moments, solid action\\" and praised Darin Morgan's comedy installment, calling it \\"fantastic\\". Overall, she concluded, \\"Season 11 so far isn't flawless, but it's a lively, character-focused affair that feels far more unified than we'd ever anticipated, a massive improvement over Season 10 that gives us genuine hope for the second half. For the first time in a while, we're truly excited to see more.\\"[41] Matt Zoller Seitz of Vulture stated that compared to the previous season, \\"This new batch of episodes is considerably stronger. Even the ones that don't really do much but spin their wheels do so with feeling, and when the show is great  as it is, yet again, in Darin Morgan's episode  it's downright sublime.\\"[42]","input":"When did the new x files series start?"},{"output":"scarlet berry","context":"The Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American romantic survival drama film directed by Randal Kleiser and filmed on Turtle Island in Fiji.[1] The screenplay by Douglas Day Stewart was based on the 1908 novel The Blue Lagoon by Henry De Vere Stacpoole. The film stars Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. The music score was composed by Basil Poledouris and the cinematography was by Nstor Almendros.\\r\\nThe film tells the story of two young children marooned on a tropical island paradise in the South Pacific. With neither the guidance nor the restrictions of society, emotional feelings and physical changes arise as they reach puberty and fall in love.\\r\\nThe film contained a substantial amount of sexual content, and Shields was depicted as nude in many of the scenes. This was controversial, as she was 14 years old at the time of the filming. Body doubles were used in some of her nude scenes and in frontal shots her breasts were always covered by her long hair or in other ways.[2] The film received an MPAA rating of R in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early Victorian period, two young child cousins, Richard (Glenn Kohan) and Emmeline Lestrange (Elva Josephson), and a galley cook, Paddy Button (Leo McKern), survive a shipwreck in the South Pacific and reach a lush tropical island. Paddy cares for the small children and forbids them by \\"Law\\" from going to the other side of the island, as he had found remains from bloody human sacrifices on an Easter Island-like altar. He also warns them against eating a scarlet berry which is apparently deadly (he calls it the \\"never-wake-up berry\\").\\r\\nPaddy soon dies after a drunken binge and his body is discovered by Richard and Emmeline. Now alone, the children go to another part of the island and rebuild their home.\\r\\nYears pass and they both grow into tall, strong and beautiful teenagers. They live in their hut, spending their days together fishing, swimming and diving for pearls. Richard and Emmeline (now portrayed by Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields) begin to fall in love, although this is emotionally stressful for them because of their lack of education on human sexuality. Emmeline is frightened after she has her first menstrual period; confused about it, she refuses to allow Richard to inspect her for what he imagines is a wound. Richard finds himself becoming physically attracted to Emmeline but she, though often fearful of being left alone, does not reciprocate his feelings, inciting Richard to go off alone and masturbate.\\r\\nSometime later, their relationship suffers a major blow when a ship appears for the first time in years. Richard's desire to leave comes into conflict with Emmeline's desire to stay and she does not light the signal fire. As a result, the ship passes by without noticing them. When Richard angrily confronts Emmeline about this, she tells him that the island is their home now and that they should stay, to Richard's disbelief.\\r\\nEmmeline's desire to stay on the island is linked to an interesting subplot concerning the theme of religious belief. She has secretly ventured to the forbidden side of the island, and seen the altar that Paddy had previously seen. However, without Paddy's knowledge of human depravity and human sacrifice, Emmeline comes to a different conclusion about the altar; she approaches it as in worship, and when she sees blood on the altar, associates this with the blood of Christ's crucifixion. She comes to the conclusion that the altar is God, and tries to persuade Richard to go to the other side of the island to pray with her. Richard is shocked at this proposal; terrified at the idea of breaking the Law. This disagreement further deepens their relationship problems.\\r\\nThey insult each other and Emmeline reveals that she knows what happens when Richard goes off alone, having caught him in the act of masturbating, and threatens to tell her Uncle Arthur about it, which leads him to throw a coconut at her. She throws one back, hitting him on the head. Immediately remorseful, Emmeline rushes over to him but he slaps her and says he wishes she was \\"dead n' buried\\". Richard's fury leads him to kick Emmeline out of their hut.\\r\\nThey make up for this fight after Emmeline is nearly killed upon stepping on a stonefish. Sick and weak, Emmeline pleads with Richard to \\"take her to God\\". Richard carries her to the other side of the island and places her on the altar, offering a prayer to God. Emmeline recovers and Richard admits to his fear of losing her.\\r\\nAfter Emmeline regains her ability to walk, they go skinny dipping in the lagoon and then swim to shore. Still naked, Richard and Emmeline discover sexual intercourse and passionate love. They regularly make love from then on while occasionally spending their time together in the nude. Emmeline becomes pregnant. During the pregnancy, Emmeline discovers cravings and morning sickness as she continually indulges in coconuts and then is discovered by Richard the following morning vomiting by the seashore. Richard and Emmeline have no knowledge of childbirth and human reproduction and assume that the physical change in Emmeline's body is her getting fat. They are stunned when they feel the baby move inside her and assume that it is her stomach causing the movements.\\r\\nRichard ventures to the far side of the island one night, following the sound of drums, and witnesses a human sacrifice on the altar. Terrified, he flees back to their home, to find Emmeline in childbirth. Emmeline gives birth to a baby boy, whom they name Paddy. Frustrated at not knowing how to feed the baby, Emmeline holds him and learns how to feed him as the baby instinctively starts sucking on her breast. The young parents spend their time playing with Paddy as he grows, teaching him how to swim, fish and build things.\\r\\nAs the family plays, a ship led by Richard's father Arthur (William Daniels) approaches the island and sees the family playing on the shore. As they are covered in mud, their appearance is difficult to determine. When they notice the approaching ship, as they are happy with their life on the island with the young Paddy, they exchange looks and tacitly walk away and stay on the island instead of signaling for help. Arthur assumes that these are natives, not the young couple they have been searching for all these years, and the ship passes.\\r\\nOne day, the young family takes the lifeboat to visit their original homesite. Richard goes off and finds bananas for them to eat, leaving Emmeline and Paddy at the boat. Emmeline looks around the shore of the island and does not notice when Paddy brings a branch of the scarlet berries into the boat. Emmeline and Paddy return to the boat and slowly drift away, until Paddy tosses one of the oars out. Unable to reach the oar, Emmeline shouts to Richard and he swims to her, followed closely by a shark. Emmeline throws the other oar at the shark, striking it and giving Richard time to get into the boat. Though close to shore, they are unable to return or retrieve the oars without risking a shark attack. They paddle with their hands to no avail; the boat is caught in the current and drifts out to sea.\\r\\nAfter drifting for days in the boat, Richard and Emmeline awake to find Paddy eating the berries he picked. Realizing that these are poisonous berries, they try to stop him, but he has already swallowed some. Hopeless, Richard and Emmeline eat the berries as well, lying down to await death. A few hours later, Arthur's ship finds them floating in the boat. Arthur asks, \\"Are they dead?\\" and the ship's captain (Gus Mercurio) answers, \\"No, sir. They're asleep\\".\\r\\nThe movie was a passion project of Randal Kleiser, who had long admired the original novel. He hired Douglas Day Stewart, who had written Boy in the Plastic Bubble, to write the script, and met up with Richard Franklin, the Australian director, who was looking for work in Hollywood. This gave him the idea to use an Australian crew, which Franklin helped supervise.[3]\\r\\nThe film was shot in Jamaica and Nanuya Levu, a privately owned island in Fiji.[4] The flora and fauna featured in the film includes an array of animals from multiple continents. As it turned out, the iguanas filmed on Fiji were a species hitherto unknown to biologists; this was noted by the herpetologist John Gibbons when he watched the film, and after traveling to the island where the iguanas were filmed, he described the Fiji crested iguana (Brachylophus vitiensis) in 1981.[5] The blue lagoon scenes were shot in Comino Island, Malta and Champagne Bay, Vanuatu.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the DVD and Blu-ray Disc versions of this film, it was stated that many of Brooke Shields' nude scenes were in fact done by older body doubles. In addition, the film's stunt coordinator, Kathy Troutt, was one of the body doubles, as well as the dolphin trainer. It was also stated that Brooke Shields had done many of her topless scenes with her hair glued to her breasts.[2][6]\\r\\nUnderwater moving picture photography was performed by Ron and Valerie Taylor.[7]\\r\\nThe Blue Lagoon was panned by critics. It currently holds a score of 10% on Rotten Tomatoes out of 21 reviews.[8] Roger Ebert gave the film 1? stars out of 4, claiming that the film \\"made him itch\\".[9] He and Gene Siskel selected the film as one of their \\"dogs of the year\\" in a 1980 episode of Sneak Previews.[10]\\r\\nThe film was the ninth biggest box office hit of 1980 in North America according to Box Office Mojo, grossing US$58,853,106 in the United States and Canada.[11]\\r\\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\\r\\nThe Blue Lagoon was based on Henry De Vere Stacpoole's novel by the same name, which first appeared in 1908. The first film adaptation of the book was the British silent 1923 film of that name. There was another British adaptation in the 1949 version. The 1980 version was true to the spirit of the book. It included much more nudity and sex scenes than the 1949 version, though far less nudity and sexual activity than did the book.\\r\\nThe story was eventually continued in the sequel Return to the Blue Lagoon (1991). This film loosely picks up where The Blue Lagoon left off, except that Richard and Emmeline are found dead in the boat. Their son is rescued. As Paddy's name is unknown to his rescuers, he is renamed Richard after his father.\\r\\nThe movie was briefly parodied in a flashback scene of the movie Top Secret! (1984). The Quantum Leap episode \\"Leaping of the Shrew\\" guest-starred Brooke Shields, and was about a young man and woman marooned on a deserted island. It was also parodied in the movie Going Berserk (1983) when John Candy reveals his reoccurring nightmare inspired by the movie. The end of the dream spoofs Christopher Atkins' masturbation scene when Candy is spotted masturbating by the jeering passengers of a ship that happens to pass by.\\r\\nOn December 9, 2011, the cable TV network Lifetime greenlit the television film Blue Lagoon: The Awakening.[13] It premiered on the channel on June 16, 2012. The male lead from the 1980 film, Christopher Atkins, appears in the 2012 film as one of the teachers on the ship-borne field trip where Emma and Dean are lost at sea and end up on an island. This film is available on DVD.\\r\\nThe Special Edition DVD, with both widescreen and full-screen versions, was released on October 5, 1999. Its special features include the theatrical trailer, the original featurette, a personal photo album by Brooke Shields, audio commentary by Randal Kleiser and Christopher Atkins, and another commentary by Randal Kleiser, Douglas Day Stewart and Brooke Shields.[14] The film was re-released in 2005 as part of a two pack with its sequel, Return to the Blue Lagoon.[15]\\r\\nA limited edition Blu-ray Disc of the film was released on December 11, 2012, by Twilight Time. Special features on the Blu-ray include an isolated score track, original trailer, three original teasers, a behind the scenes featurette called An Adventure in Filmmaking: The Making of The Blue Lagoon, as well as audio commentary by Randal Kleiser, Douglas Day Stewart and Brooke Shields and a second commentary by Randal Kleiser and Christopher Atkins.[16][17]\\r\\nThe 1980 movie was made available for streaming through services such as Amazon Video and Vudu.[18][19]","input":"What were the berries in the blue lagoon?"},{"output":"Ron Rivera","context":"Ronald Eugene \\"Ron\\" Rivera (born January 7, 1962)[1] is an American football coach and former player who is the head coach of the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL). He has also been the defensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears and San Diego Chargers.\\r\\nRivera played college football at the University of California in Berkeley, and was recognized as an All-American linebacker. He was selected in the second round of the 1984 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, and was a backup on the 1985 team which won Super Bowl XX.\\r\\nAs a coach, Rivera was the defensive coordinator for Bears in the 2006, who were NFC champions and competed in Super Bowl XLI. In 2011, he was named head coach of the Panthers. Rivera was recognized as the NFL Coach of the Year by the Associated Press in 2013 and in 2015.[2] Since taking over the Panthers, he has led the team to three straight divisional titles, and an appearance in Super Bowl 50.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRivera was born on January 7, 1962 in Fort Ord, California. His father was a Puerto Rican commissioned officer in the U.S. Army stationed in California. There he met his future wife, Rivera's mother. Due to his father's military service, Rivera had to travel and was educated in military bases in Germany, Panama, Washington, D.C., and Maryland. Finally, his family moved to central California where, he attended Seaside High School. Rivera first started playing football in high school.[3]\\r\\nRivera was granted a football scholarship to California, where he was a consensus All-American linebacker, leading the Golden Bears in tackles for his last three years as a player. He once held Cal's all-time sack and career tackles records, and still holds the record for most tackles for loss in a season, set in 1983. Rivera was the MVP of the 1984 East-West Shrine Game.[4]\\r\\nIn the 1984 NFL draft, Rivera was selected in the second round by the Chicago Bears. During the 1985 season, he played in Super Bowl XX, where the Bears routed the New England Patriots, 46ÿ10. Rivera was the first Mexican/Puerto Rican to play on a Super Bowl championship team. He became the starter in 1988, serving for three seasons. Rivera played for the Bears for a total of nine seasons (1984ÿ1992).[5]\\r\\nIn 1993, Rivera went to work for WGN-TV and SportsChannel Chicago as a TV analyst covering the Bears and college football. In 1996, he became a defense quality control coach for the Bears.\\r\\nIn 1999, Rivera was named linebackers coach for the Philadelphia Eagles. During his tenure, the Eagles advanced to the NFC championship for three consecutive seasons. He is credited with developing linebacker Jeremiah Trotter into a two-time Pro Bowl performer.\\r\\nOn January 23, 2004, Rivera was named defensive coordinator of the Bears. In 2005, the Bears defense was rated second-best in the NFL.[6] The Bears qualified for the NFC playoffs, losing in the second round to the Carolina Panthers, 29ÿ21. The 2005 performance of the Chicago Bears earned him consideration for Head Coach assignments from several NFL teams.\\r\\nIn 2006, the Bears' defensive efforts failed to match the success of their 2005 season. Nevertheless, the team was still a notable presence in league, finishing with the league's third ranked and conference's top-ranked points allowed category.[6] The defense's success earned Rivera recognition among franchises looking for new head coaches. The Arizona Cardinals and Pittsburgh Steelers interviewed him in January 2007. He was a candidate for the vacant Dallas Cowboys head coaching position, a job that ultimately went to San Diego Chargers defensive coordinator Wade Phillips. Rivera was named as a potential candidate to replace the fired Marty Schottenheimer in San Diego, but the job was filled by Norv Turner, the brother of fellow offensive coordinator, Ron Turner, Rivera's offensive counterpart in Chicago.[7][8][9] After the announcement, ESPN reported that the Bears were considering letting Rivera go. This came after several other teams interviewed him, and the negotiations between his representatives and the Bears were making little progress.[10] On February 19, 2007, it was announced that Ron Rivera's contract with the Bears would not be renewed.[11]\\r\\nThe San Diego Chargers hired Rivera as team's inside linebackers coach after he left the Bears.[12] On October 28, 2008, Rivera was promoted to defensive coordinator with the Chargers after the team released former defensive coordinator Ted Cottrell.[13] Rivera had used the 4ÿ3 defense for most of his coaching career, but adopted a 3ÿ4 scheme with the Chargers.\\r\\nOn January 11, 2011, Rivera was named the fourth head coach of the Carolina Panthers. He is the fifth Latino to be an NFL head coach, following former New Orleans Saints coach Tom Fears, former Oakland Raiders and Seattle Seahawks coach Tom Flores, former New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts coach Jim E. Mora, and former Atlanta Falcons coach Jim L. Mora.\\r\\nDuring his first year as head coach, the Panthers went 6ÿ10 and finished third in the division. In 2012, the Panthers finished 7ÿ9 and finished second in the division. Following the 2012 season, Rivera was expected to be fired.[14]\\r\\nOver the first 34 games of his coaching career, Rivera was known for exceptionally conservative decision-making that led to a 2ÿ14 record in games decided by less than a touchdown. Against the Buffalo Bills in Week 2, Rivera decided to kick a field goal while up 3 points and facing a fourth and one deep inside the Bills territory late in the fourth quarter. The Bills proceeded to drive for a touchdown on their next drive, scoring on a touchdown pass with less than 20 seconds remaining in the game.[15] With Carolina opening the 2013 season 0ÿ2, reports circled that the front office was already performing background checks on new potential head coach candidates. Rivera then changed his coaching philosophy and became a more aggressive coach.[15] Facing a 4th and 1 from the two-yard line in the first quarter against the also 0ÿ2 New York Giants in Week 3, Rivera went for the touchdown instead of a field goal. A Mike Tolbert run found the end zone, and Carolina ended up winning the game 38ÿ0.[15]\\r\\nOver the next five games, the Panthers went for a first down five times in situations where conventional strategy called for a field goal attempt. They converted on four of them and ended each of those drives with touchdowns, all in wins. The lone failure was against the Cardinals when Brandon LaFell dropped a wide open pass across the middle from Cam Newton that would have resulted in a sure touchdown as well. This sudden aggression in his play-calling earned Rivera the nickname \\"Riverboat Ron\\", after Riverboat gamblers.[16] Rivera has expressed discontent with the nickname, however, explaining he is \\"a calculated risk taker\\" not a gambler.[17] The Panthers went 11ÿ1 to finish the season, including a then-franchise record eight-game winning streak, to win the NFC South title and make the playoffs for the first time since 2008. Rivera was honored as the 2013 AP NFL Coach of the Year.\\r\\nIn Rivera's fourth season as the Panthers' coach, Carolina recovered from a 3ÿ8ÿ1 start to win its final four regular-season games and clinch the NFC South championship for the second consecutive year. The Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 27ÿ16 in the NFC Wild Card playoff game for the team's first playoff win since 2005.\\r\\nThe team's momentum would continue in 2015. The Panthers produced the best season in franchise history, and one of the best regular seasons in NFL history. The Panthers started the season 14ÿ0, the best regular-season start in franchise history. They ultimately finished 15ÿ1 (their only loss was in week 16 in Atlanta, a 20ÿ13 defeat by the Falcons), a franchise record for wins in a season, to clinch home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. They defeated the Seattle Seahawks in the Divisional Playoffs by a score of 31ÿ24, and routed the Arizona Cardinals with a 49ÿ15 victory in the NFC Championship Game, leading the Panthers to their second Super Bowl appearance. Rivera is the fifth man of color to lead a team to the Super Bowl. He was also recognized as the 2015 AP NFL Coach of the Year; his second such honor of his career. On February 7, 2016, Rivera coached the Panthers in Super Bowl 50. The Panthers fell to the Denver Broncos by a score of 24ÿ10.[18]\\r\\nDespite reaching the playoffs three years in a row from 2013ÿ2015, Rivera has been unable to produce back-to-back winning seasons as a head coach. Following a 22ÿ19 playoff-clinching victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 16 of the 2017 season, Rivera became the first head coach in Panthers history with four playoff appearances. On January 6, 2018, Rivera signed a two year contract extension.[19]\\r\\nRivera was born to a Puerto Rican father, who served a career in the U.S. military, and a Mexican mother. He has two children, a son, Christopher, and a daughter, Courtney, with his wife, Stephanie, who is a former assistant coach for the WNBA's Washington Mystics.[20][21] In 2003, Rivera was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Cal (University of California, Berkeley) Sports Hall of Fame in 1994.[22] On January 5, 2015, Rivera's home in Charlotte, North Carolina, caught on fire. Everyone escaped the house without injuries.[23] On July 28, 2015, Rivera's brother Mickey died after a two-year battle with cancer.[24]\\r\\nRivera has been a resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey.[25]","input":"Who is the head coach for carolina panthers?"},{"output":"woodwind","context":"Military band family:\\r\\nOrchestral family:\\r\\nOther saxophones:\\r\\nThe saxophone (also referred to as the sax) is a family of woodwind instruments. Saxophones are usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet.[2] Like the clarinet, saxophones have holes in the instrument which the player closes using a system of key mechanisms. When the player presses a key, a pad either covers a hole or lifts off a hole, lowering or raising the pitch, respectively.\\r\\nThe saxophone family was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in 1840.[2][3] Adolphe Sax wanted to create a group or series of instruments that would be the most powerful and vocal of the woodwinds, and the most adaptive of the brass instruments, that would fill the vacant middle ground between the two sections. Mr. Sax patented the saxophone on June 28, 1846, in two groups of seven instruments each. Each series consisted of instruments of various sizes in alternating transposition. The series pitched in B? and E?, designed for military bands, have proved popular and most saxophones encountered today are from this series. Instruments from the so-called \\"orchestral\\" series, pitched in C and F, never gained a foothold, and the B? and E? instruments have now replaced the C and F instruments when the saxophone is used in an orchestra.\\r\\nThe saxophone is used in classical music (such as concert bands, chamber music, solo repertoire, and, occasionally, orchestras), military bands, marching bands, and jazz (such as big bands and jazz combos). The saxophone is also used as a soloing and melody instrument or as a member of a horn section in some styles of rock and roll and popular music. Saxophone players are called saxophonists.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saxophone was developed in 1846 by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian instrument maker, flautist, and clarinetist. Born in Dinant and originally based in Brussels, he moved to Paris in 1842 to establish his musical instrument business. Prior to his work on the saxophone, he had made several improvements to the bass clarinet by improving its keywork and acoustics and extending its lower range. Sax was also a maker of the then-popular ophicleide, a large conical brass instrument in the bass register with keys similar to a woodwind instrument. His experience with these two instruments allowed him to develop the skills and technologies needed to make the first saxophones. As an outgrowth of his work improving the bass clarinet, Sax began developing an instrument with the projection of a brass instrument and the agility of a woodwind. He wanted it to overblow at the octave, unlike the clarinet, which rises in pitch by a twelfth when overblown. An instrument that overblows at the octave has identical fingering for both registers.\\r\\nSax created an instrument with a single-reed mouthpiece like a clarinet, conical brass body like an ophicleide, and some acoustic properties of both the horn and the clarinet.[clarification needed]\\r\\nHaving constructed saxophones in several sizes in the early 1840s, Sax applied for, and received, a 15-year patent for the instrument on June 28, 1846.[4] The patent encompassed 14 versions of the fundamental design, split into two categories of seven instruments each, and ranging from sopranino to contrabass. Although the instruments transposed at either F or C have been considered \\"orchestral\\", there is no evidence that Sax intended this. As only three percent of Sax's surviving production were pitched in F and C, and as contemporary composers used the E? alto and B? bass saxophone freely in orchestral music, it is almost certain that Sax experimented to find the most suitable keys for these instruments, settling upon instruments alternating between E? and B? rather than those pitched in F or C, for reasons of tone and economy (the saxophones were the most expensive wind instruments of their day). The C soprano saxophone was the only instrument to sound at concert pitch. All the instruments were given an initial written range from the B below the treble staff to the F, one space above the three ledger lines above staff, giving each saxophone a range of two and a half octaves.\\r\\nSax's patent expired in 1866;[5] thereafter, numerous saxophonists and instrument manufacturers implemented their own improvements to the design and keywork. The first substantial modification was by a French manufacturer who extended the bell slightly and added an extra key to extend the range downwards by one semitone to B?. It is suspected that Sax himself may have attempted this modification. This extension is now commonplace in almost all modern designs, along with other minor changes such as added keys for alternate fingerings. Using alternate fingerings allows a player to play faster and more easily. A player may also use alternate fingerings to bend the pitch. Some of the alternate fingerings are good for trilling, scales, and big interval jumps.[6]\\r\\nSax's original keywork, which was based on the Triebert system 3 oboe for the left hand and the Boehm clarinet for the right, was simplistic and made playing some legato passages and wide intervals extremely difficult to finger, so numerous developers added extra keys and alternate fingerings to make chromatic playing less difficult. While early saxophones had two separate octave vents to assist in the playing of the upper registers just as modern instruments do, players of Sax's original design had to operate these via two separate octave keys operated by the left thumb. A substantial advancement in saxophone keywork was the development of a method by which the left thumb operates both tone holes with a single octave key, which is now universal on modern saxophones. Further developments were made by Selmer in the 1930s and '40s, including offsetting tone holes and a revamping of the octave key mechanism, beginning with balanced action instruments and continuing through their celebrated Mark VI line.[citation needed] One of the most radical, however temporary, revisions of saxophone keywork was made in the 1950s by M. Houvenaghel of Paris, who completely redeveloped the mechanics of the system to allow a number of notes (C?, B, A, G, F and E?) to be flattened by a semitone simply by pressing the right middle finger. This enables a chromatic scale to be played over two octaves simply by playing the diatonic scale combined with alternately raising and lowering this one digit.[7] However, this keywork never gained much popularity, and is no longer in use.\\r\\nThe saxophone consists of an approximately conical tube, usually of thin brass, flared at the tip to form a bell. At intervals along the tube are between 20 and 23 tone holes of varying size and two very small vent holes to assist the playing of the upper register. These holes are covered by keys (also known as pad cups) containing soft leather pads, which are closed to produce an airtight seal. At rest some of the holes stand open and others are closed. The keys are activated by keytouches pressed by the fingers, either directly on the pad cup or connected to it with levers, either directly or with joints called \\"linkages.\\" The right thumb sits under a thumb rest to stabilize and balance the saxophone, while the weight of most saxophones is supported by a neckstrap attached to a strap ring on the rear of the body of the instrument. The fingering for the saxophone is a combination of that of the oboe with the Boehm system and is very similar to the flute or upper register of the clarinet. Instruments that play to low A have a left thumb key for that note.\\r\\nThe simplest design of saxophone is a straight conical tube, and the sopranino and soprano saxophones are usually of this design. However, as the lower-pitched instruments would be unacceptably long, they usually incorporate a U-bend (\\"bow\\") at or slightly above the third-lowest tone hole. As this would cause the bell to point almost directly upward, the end of the instrument is either beveled or tilted slightly forward. This U-shape has become a distinctive feature of the saxophone family, to the extent that soprano and even sopranino saxes are sometimes made in the curved style. By contrast, tenors and even baritones have occasionally been made in the straight style.[8][9] Most commonly, however, the alto and tenor saxophones incorporate a detachable, curved \\"neck\\" above the highest tone hole directing the mouthpiece to the player's mouth while the instrument is held in a playing stance. The baritone, bass, and contrabass saxophones accommodate the length of the bore with extra bows and right-angle bends between the main body and the mouthpiece.\\r\\nMost saxophones, past and present, are made from brass. Despite this, they are categorized as woodwind instruments rather than brass, as the sound waves are produced by an oscillating wooden reed, not the lips against a mouthpiece as in a brass instrument, and because pitches are produced by breath wind passing opening and closing keys. The screw pins that connect the rods to the posts, as well as the needle and leaf springs that cause the keys to return to their rest position after being released, are generally made of blued or stainless steel. Since 1920, most saxophones have \\"key touches\\" (smooth replaceable pieces placed where the fingers touch the instrument) made from either plastic or mother of pearl. Recently, some saxophones are offered with abalone or stone keytouches.\\r\\nOther materials have been tried with varying degrees of success, such as the 1950s Grafton plastic alto saxophone and its recent successor, the polycarbonate saxophone, Vibratosax. There is also the wooden Sawat saxophone created in Thailand on a small scale. Recent years have seen the use of higher copper alloys substituted for the \\"yellow brass\\" or \\"cartridge brass\\" that are most common, for visual and tonal effect. Yanagisawa's 902 and 992 series saxophones are made with phosphor bronze, which is claimed to offer slightly different, more \\"vintage\\" tonal qualities from the brass 901 and 991 models of identical design.[10] Other saxophones made of high copper alloys are sold under the brands Chateau, Kessler, Saxgourmet, and Bauhaus Walstein. Yanagisawa and other manufacturers, starting with the King Super 20 around 1950, have made saxophone necks, bells, or entire instruments from sterling silver.[11] Keilwerth and P. Mauriat have made saxes with a nickel silver body.[12][13] Opinions vary on the significance of body materials to sound. With the exception of the identical brass and phosphor bronze Yanagisawa models, opportunities to isolate body materials from other variables in design and construction are lacking.\\r\\nPrior to final assembly, the manufacturers usually apply a thin coating of clear or colored acrylic lacquer or silver plate over the brass. The lacquer or plating serves to protect the brass from oxidation and maintains its shiny appearance. Several different types and colors of surface finish have been used over the years.[14] It is also possible to plate the instrument with nickel or gold, and a number of gold-plated saxophones have been produced.[14] Plating saxophones with gold is an expensive process because gold does not adhere directly to brass. As a result, the brass is first plated with silver, then gold. Some saxophonists, sellers, and repair technicians argue that the type of lacquer or plating or absence thereof[15] may enhance an instrument's tone quality. The possible effects of different finishes on tone are difficult to isolate from the other variables that affect an instrument's tone colors. In any case, what constitutes a pleasing tone is a matter of personal preference.\\r\\nThe saxophone uses a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. Most saxophonists use reeds made from Arundo donax cane, but since the 20th century some have also been made of fiberglass and other composite materials. Saxophone reeds are proportioned slightly differently from clarinet reeds, being wider for the same length, although some soprano saxophonists use clarinet reeds. Each size of saxophone (alto, tenor, etc.) uses a different size of reed. Reeds are commercially available in a vast array of brands, styles, and strengths. Saxophonists experiment with reeds of different strength (hardnesses) and material to find which strength and cut suits their mouthpiece, embouchure, physiology, and playing style.\\r\\nThe saxophone mouthpiece is larger than that of the clarinet, has a wider inner chamber, and lacks the cork-covered tenon because the saxophone neck inserts into the mouthpiece whereas the clarinet mouthpiece is inserted into the barrel. Saxophone and clarinet embouchures differ from each other in firmness, position of the lower lip, and range of entry angles. The \\"long tones\\" exercise is used to develop embouchure, along with airstream and breath control.[16] Mouthpieces come in a wide variety of materials, including vulcanized rubber (sometimes called hard rubber or ebonite), plastic, and metals such as bronze or surgical steel. Less common materials that have been used include wood, glass, crystal, porcelain, and even bone. According to Larry Teal, the mouthpiece material has little, if any, effect on the sound, and the physical dimensions give a mouthpiece its tone colour.[17] There are examples of \\"dark\\" sounding metal pieces and \\"bright\\" sounding hard rubber pieces ÿ Marcel Mule, for example, used a metal mouthpiece to perform classical music.[18] Some[who?] contend that instability at the mouthpiece/neck connection moves harmonic frequencies off series with the fundamental frequency and each other, resulting in a \\"spread\\" sound, and that the weight of a metal mouthpiece counteracts that instability, increasing tonal \\"focus.\\" Mouthpiece design has a profound impact on tone. Early mouthpieces were designed to produce a warm and round sound for classical playing. Among classical mouthpieces, those with a concave (\\"excavated\\") chamber are more true to Adolphe Sax's original design; these provide a softer or less piercing tone favored by some saxophonists, including students of Sigurd Raschr, for classical playing. Saxophonists who follow the French school of classical saxophone playing, influenced by Marcel Mule, generally use mouthpieces with smaller chambers than Rascher style mouthpieces. The use of the saxophone in dance orchestras and jazz ensembles put a premium on dynamic range, projection, and tonal richness, leading to rapid innovation in chamber shape and tip design, and metal construction. At the opposite extreme from the classical mouthpieces are those with a small chamber and a low clearance above the reed between the tip and the chamber, called high baffle. These produce a bright sound with maximum projection, suitable for having a sound stand out among amplified instruments and typical of modern pop and smooth jazz. Most saxophonists who play different styles have a mouthpiece suited for each style.\\r\\nThe primary (military band) saxophone family alternates instruments in B? and E?. The other (orchestral) family patented by Sax, alternating instruments in C and F, has always been marginal, although some manufacturers tried to popularise the soprano in C (C soprano saxophone), the alto in F (mezzo-soprano saxophone), and the tenor in C (C melody saxophone) early in the twentieth century. The C melody enjoyed some success in the late 1920s and early 1930s as a parlor instrument. One company has recently revived production of the C soprano and C melody.[19] Instruments in F are rare. A mezzo-soprano in G has also been produced.\\r\\nThe saxophone first gained popularity in one of the uses it was designed for: military bands. Although the instrument was mostly ignored in Germany at first, French and Belgian military bands took full advantage of the instrument that Sax had designed. Most French and Belgian military bands incorporate at least a quartet of saxophones, comprising an E? baritone, B? tenor, E? alto and B? soprano. These four instruments have proved the most popular of all of Sax's creations, with the E? contrabass and B? bass usually considered impractically large and the E? sopranino insufficiently powerful. British military bands tend to include at minimum two saxophonists, on the alto and tenor. Today, the saxophone is used in military bands all around the world.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe saxophone was subsequently introduced into the concert bands, which generally call for an E? alto saxophone, a B? tenor saxophone, and an E? baritone saxophone. A typical high-level[clarification needed] concert band includes two altos, one tenor, and one baritone. A B? soprano saxophone is also occasionally used, in which case it is normally played by the first alto saxophonist. A bass saxophone in B? is called for in some concert band music (especially music by Percy Grainger).[20]\\r\\nSaxophones are used in chamber music, such as saxophone quartets and other chamber combinations of instruments.\\r\\nThe classical saxophone quartet consists of a soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, and baritone saxophone. There is a repertoire of classical compositions and arrangements for the SATB instrumentation dating back to the nineteenth century, particularly by French composers who knew Sax. Classical saxophone quartets include Quatuor Habanera, the h2 quartet, the Raschr Saxophone Quartet, the Aurelia Saxophone Quartet, the New Century Saxophone Quartet. The quartets led by Marcel Mule and Daniel Deffayet, saxophone professors at the Conservatoire de Paris, were started in 1928 and 1953, respectively, and were highly regarded. The Mule quartet is often considered the prototype for future quartets, due the level of virtuosity demonstrated by its members and its central role in the development of the quartet repertoire. However, organised quartets did exist before Mule's ensemble, the prime example being the quartet headed by Eduard Lefebre (1834ÿ1911), former soloist with the Sousa band, in the United States c. 1904ÿ1911. Other ensembles most likely existed at this time as part of the saxophone sections of the many touring professional bands that existed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the saxophone found increased popularity in symphony orchestras. In one or another size, the instrument has also been found as a useful accompaniment to genres such as opera and choral music. Many musical theatre scores include parts for a saxophone, sometimes doubling another woodwind or brass instrument. In this way, the saxophone serves as a middle point between other woodwinds and the brass section, helping to blend them.\\r\\nSaxophones are also commonly used in jazz music, where it is one of the signature sounds, as well as an iconic image used to denote the style. Beginning in the early 20th century, saxophones became popular in dance orchestras, which were not jazz ensembles but influenced the format of the big swing era bands that were soon to follow. The arrival of the saxophone as a jazz instrument is attributed to tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins' stint with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra starting in 1923. The saxophone was soon embraced by Chicago-style musicians who added it, along with chordal instruments such as pianos, banjos, and guitars, to the trumpet-clarinet-trombone-bass-drums ensemble format inherited from New Orleans jazz.\\r\\nThe Duke Ellington Orchestra of the late 1920s featured saxophone-based ensemble sounds and solos by saxophonists Otto Hardwick, Johnny Hodges, and Harry Carney. The swing bands of the 1930s utilized arrangements of saxophone and brass sections playing off each other in call-response patterns. The influence of tenor saxophonist Lester Young with the Count Basie Orchestra in the late 1930s and the tremendous popularity of Coleman Hawkins' 1939 recording of \\"Body and Soul\\" marked the saxophone as an influence on jazz equal to that of the trumpet, which had been the defining instrument of jazz since its beginnings in New Orleans. But the greatest influence of the saxophone on jazz was to occur a few years later, as alto saxophonist Charlie Parker became an icon of the bebop revolution that influenced generations of jazz musicians. The small-group format of bebop and post-bebop jazz ensembles, typically with one to three lead instruments, usually including a saxophone, a chordal instrument, bass, and drums, gained ascendancy in the 1940s as musicians emphasized extended exploration utilizing the new harmonic and melodic freedoms that Charlie Parker and a few others, such as Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and Bud Powell pioneered.\\r\\nIn addition to the brilliance and virtuosity of Parker, the alto sax was also popularized in the 1950s by top saxophonists such as Sonny Stitt, Cannonball Adderley, Sonny Criss and Paul Desmond (of the Dave Brubeck Quartet). The tenor sax, a popular form of saxophone as a solo instrument in jazz, was popularized by jazz greats such as Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, Dexter Gordon, John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Stan Getz and Zoot Sims. The baritone sax, featured more in big bands (notably by Harry Carney in the Duke Ellington Orchestra) and larger ensembles than as a solo instrument, was popularized in jazz as a solo instrument within small groups by musicians such as Serge Chaloff, Gerry Mulligan, Pepper Adams and Leo Parker. The soprano saxophone was popularized by Sidney Bechet in early jazz, but then largely fell out of favor on the jazz scene until John Coltrane began to feature the instrument.[citation needed] Popular smooth jazz and contemporary pop musician Kenny G also uses the soprano sax as his principal instrument.\\r\\nSaxophonists such as John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Sam Rivers and Pharoah Sanders again defined the forefront of creative exploration with the avant-garde movement of the 1960s. Modal, harmolodic, and free jazz further removed boundaries and the new space was explored with every device that saxophonists could conceive of. Sheets of sound, tonal exploration, upper harmonics, and multiphonics were hallmarks of the creative possibilities that saxophones offered in the new realm. One lasting influence of the avant-garde movement is the exploration of non-Western ethnic sounds on the saxophone, for example, the African-influenced sounds used by Pharoah Sanders. The devices of the avant-garde movement have continued to be influential in music that challenges the boundaries between avant-garde and other categories of jazz, such as that of alto-saxophonists Steve Coleman and Greg Osby.\\r\\nA jazz saxophone quartet is usually made up of one B? soprano, one E? alto, one B? tenor and one E? baritone (SATB). On occasion, the soprano is replaced with a second alto sax (AATB); a few professional saxophone quartets have featured non-standard instrumentation, such as James Fei's Alto Quartet[23] (four altos) and Hamiet Bluiett's Bluiett Baritone Nation (four baritones). Recently, the World Saxophone Quartet has become known as the preeminent jazz saxophone quartet.\\r\\nThe saxophone, as a solo instrument or as part of a horn section, can also be heard in blues, soul music, rhythm and blues, reggae, ska, funk, rock and roll, and other forms of popular music. Some players of these genres include King Curtis, Maceo Parker, Bobby Keys, Clarence Clemons, the Memphis Horns, and the Phenix Horns.\\r\\nA number of saxes and saxophone-related instruments have appeared since Sax's original work, most with no significant success. These include the saxello, essentially a straight B? soprano, but with a slightly curved neck and tipped bell; the straight alto; and the straight B? tenor.[24] Since a straight-bore tenor is approximately five feet long, the cumbersome size of such a design makes it almost impossible to either play or transport. \\"King\\" Saxellos, made by the H. N. White Company in the 1920s, now command prices up to US $4,000. A number of companies, including Keilwerth, Rampone & Cazzani (altello model), L.A. Sax and Sax Dakota USA, are marketing straight-bore, tipped-bell soprano saxophones as saxellos (or \\"saxello sopranos\\").\\r\\nThe contralto saxophone, similar in size to the orchestral soprano, was developed in the late 20th century by Californian instrument maker Jim Schmidt.[25] This instrument has a larger bore and a new fingering system, and does not resemble the C melody instrument except for its key and register. Another new arrival to the sax scene is the soprillo sax, a piccolo-sized straight instrument with the upper speaker hole built into the mouthpiece. The instrument, which extends Sax's original family, as it is pitched a full octave higher than the B? soprano sax, is manufactured by Benedikt Eppelsheim, of Munich, Germany. There is a rare prototype slide tenor saxophone. One company that produced a slide soprano saxophone was Reiffel & Husted, Chicago, c. 1922 (catalog NMM 5385).[26][27][28]\\r\\nTwo of these variants were championed by jazz musician Rahsaan Roland Kirk, who called his straight Buescher alto a \\"stritch\\" and his modified saxello a \\"manzello\\"; the latter featured a larger-than-usual bell and modified key work. Among some saxophonists,[weasel?words] Kirk's terms have taken on a life of their own in that it is believed that these were \\"special\\" or \\"new\\" saxophones that might still be available. Though rare, the Buescher straight alto was a production item instrument while the manzello was indeed a saxello with a custom-made bell.\\r\\nAnother unusual variant of the saxophone is the Conn-O-Sax, a straight-conical bore instrument in F (one step above the E? alto) with a slightly curved neck and spherical bell. This instrument, which combines a saxophone bore and keys with a bell shaped similar to that of a heckelphone, was intended to imitate the timbre of the English horn and was produced only in 1929 and 1930. The instrument has a key range from low A to high G. Fewer than 100 Conn-O-Saxes are in existence, and they are highly sought by collectors. More recently a mezzo-soprano in the key of G has been produced by Danish woodwind technician Peter Jessen, most notably played by Joe Lovano. This instrument is more in the timbral quality of Bb soprano saxophone.\\r\\nThe tubax, developed in 1999 by the German instrument maker Benedikt Eppelsheim,[29] plays the same range, and with the same fingering, as the E? contrabass saxophone; its bore, however, is narrower than that of a contrabass saxophone, making for a more compact instrument with a \\"reedier\\" tone (akin to the double-reed contrabass sarrusophone). It can be played with the smaller (and more commonly available) baritone saxophone mouthpiece and reeds. Eppelsheim has also produced subcontrabass tubaxes in C and B?, the latter being the lowest saxophone ever made. Among the most recent developments is the aulochrome, a double soprano saxophone invented by Belgian instrument maker Fran?ois Louis in 2001.\\r\\nThe fingering scheme of the saxophone, which has had only minor changes since the instrument's original invention, has presented inherent acoustic problems related to closed keys below the first open tonehole that affect response of, and slightly muffle, some notes. There is also a lack of tactile consistency moving between key centers. Extra effort is required from the player to adjust modes of muscle memory when moving between key centers. Two efforts to remedy the acoustic problems and awkward aspects of the original fingering system are noteworthy.\\r\\nThe Leblanc Rationale and System[30] saxophones have key mechanics designed to remedy the acoustic problems associated with closed keys below the first open tonehole. They also enable players to make half-step shifts of scales by depressing one key while keeping the rest of the fingering consistent with that of the fingering a half step away (which can also trip up players used to certain alternate fingerings on a regular saxophone). Some Leblanc System features were built into the Vito Model 35 saxophones of the 1950s and 1960s. The acceptance of what was arguably a superior system was impaired by the adjustment required of players switching between System and non-System horns, and the added costs associated with the compounded complexity of certain key mechanisms.\\r\\nThe chromatic or linear fingering, saxophone is a project of instrument designer and builder Jim Schmidt, developing a horn maximizing tactile and logical consistency between every interval regardless of the key, and avoiding the acoustic problems associated closed keys below the first open tone hole.[31] Several working prototypes have been built and presented at trade shows.[32] Production of this original and expensive saxophone is on an individual order basis.\\r\\nAlthough not true saxophones, inexpensive keyless folk versions of the saxophone made of bamboo (recalling a chalumeau) were developed in the 20th century by instrument makers in Hawaii, Jamaica, Thailand, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Argentina. The Hawaiian instrument, called a xaphoon, was invented during the 1970s and is also marketed as a \\"bamboo sax,\\" although its cylindrical bore more closely resembles that of a clarinet, and its lack of any keywork makes it more akin to a recorder. Jamaica's best known exponent of a similar type of homemade bamboo \\"saxophone\\" was the mento musician and instrument maker 'Sugar Belly' (William Walker).[33] In the Minahasa region of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there exist entire bands made up of bamboo \\"saxophones\\"[34] and \\"brass\\" instruments of various sizes. These instruments are imitations of European instruments, made using local materials. Very similar instruments are produced in Thailand.[35][36] In Argentina, ngel Sampedro del Ro and Mariana Garca have produced bamboo saxophones of various sizes since 1985, the larger of which have bamboo keys to allow for the playing of lower notes.[37]\\r\\nMusic for most saxophones is usually notated using treble clef. The standard written range extends from a B? below the staff to an F or F? three ledger lines above the staff. Most, if not all, intermediate and professional saxophones made today are built with F? keys, with F? included on even student instruments.\\r\\nThere are many models of soprano saxophone that have a key for high G, and most modern models of baritone saxophone have an extended bore and key to produce low A; it is also possible to play a low A on any saxophone by blocking the end of the bell, usually with the foot or inside of the left thigh. Low A keys however were not limited to just the baritone saxophone. For a short time Selmer Paris produced mark VI alto saxophones with the low A key. Notes above F are considered part of the altissimo register of any sax, and can be produced using advanced embouchure techniques and fingering combinations. Sax himself had mastered these techniques; he demonstrated the instrument as having a range of just beyond three octaves up to a (written) high B4. Modern saxophone players have extended this range to over 4 octaves on tenor and alto.\\r\\nBecause all saxophones use the same key arrangement and fingering to produce a given notated pitch, it is not difficult for a competent player to switch among the various sizes when the music has been suitably transposed, and many do so. Since the baritone and alto are pitched in E?, players can read concert pitch music notated in the bass clef by reading it as if it were treble clef and adding three sharps to the key signature. This process, referred to as clef substitution, makes it possible for the Eb instruments to play from parts written for baritone horn, bassoon, euphonium, string bass, trombone, or tuba. This can be useful if a band or orchestra lacks one of those instruments.\\r\\nFrom left to right, an E? alto saxophone, a curved B? soprano saxophone, and a B? tenor saxophone\\r\\nA straight-necked Conn C melody saxophone (Conn New Wonder Series 1)[38] with a serial number that dates manufacture to 1922\\r\\nVintage silver-plated 'Pennsylvania Special' alto saxophone, manufactured by Kohlert & Sons for Selmer[39] in Czechoslovakia, circa 1930\\r\\nConn 6M \\"Lady Face\\"[40] brass alto saxophone (dated 1935) in its original case\\r\\n1950s Grafton alto made of plastic\\r\\nYamaha YAS-25 alto saxophone.

He was the first human to journey into outer space when his Vostok spacecraft completed an orbit of the Earth on 12 April 1961.\\r\\n\\r\\nGagarin became an international celebrity and was awarded many medals and titles, including Hero of the Soviet Union, the nation's highest honour. Vostok 1 marked his only spaceflight, but he served as backup crew to the Soyuz 1 mission (which ended in a fatal crash). Gagarin later became deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow, which was later named after him. Gagarin died in 1968 when the MiG-15 training jet he was piloting crashed. The Fdration Aronautique Internationale awards the Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal in his honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was born 9 March 1934 in the village of Klushino, near Gzhatsk (renamed Gagarin in 1968 after his death).[1] His parents worked on a collective farm:[2] Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin as a carpenter and bricklayer, and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina as a milkmaid.[note 2][3] Yuri was the third of four children: older brother Valentin, older sister Zoya, and younger brother Boris.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike millions of people in the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family suffered during Nazi occupation in World War II. Klushino was occupied in November 1941 during the German advance on Moscow, and an officer took over the Gagarin residence. The family was allowed to build a mud hut, approximately 3 by 3 metres (10 by 10?ft) inside, on the land behind their house, where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation.[5] His two older siblings were deported by the Germans to Poland for slave labour in 1943, and did not return until after the war in 1945.[4][6] In 1946, the family moved to Gzhatsk, where Gagarin continued his secondary education.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1950, Gagarin entered into an apprenticeship at age 16 as a foundryman at the Lyubertsy Steel Plant near Moscow,[4][6] and also enrolled at a local \\"young workers\\" school for seventh grade evening classes.[7] After graduating in 1951 from both the seventh grade and the vocational school with honours in moldmaking and foundry work,[7] he was selected for further training at the Saratov Industrial Technical School, where he studied tractors.[4][6][8] While in Saratov, Gagarin volunteered for weekend training as a Soviet air cadet at a local flying club, where he learned to fly  at first in a biplane and later in a Yak-18 trainer.[6][8] He also earned extra money as a part-time dock laborer on the Volga River.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he graduated from the technical school in 1955, the Soviet Army drafted Gagarin.[7] On a recommendation, Gagarin was sent to the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, and soloed in a MiG-15 in 1957.[4][6][7] After graduation, he was assigned to the Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast, close to the Norwegian border, where terrible weather made flying risky. He became a Lieutenant in the Soviet Air Forces on 5 November 1957; on 6 November 1959 he received the rank of Senior Lieutenant.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960, after an extensive search and selection process, Gagarin was chosen with 19 other pilots for the Soviet space program. Gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the Sochi Six, from which the first cosmonauts of the Vostok programme would be chosen. Gagarin and other prospective candidates were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the twenty selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and Gherman Titov due to their performance during training sessions as well as their physical characteristics? space was limited in the small Vostok cockpit, and both men were rather short. Gagarin was 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in) tall.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1960, when Gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates, a Soviet Air Force doctor evaluated his personality as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nModest; embarrasses when his humor gets a little too racy; high degree of intellectual development evident in Yuriy; fantastic memory; distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings; a well-developed imagination; quick reactions; persevering, prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises, handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics; does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right; appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nGagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers. When the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly, all but three chose Gagarin.[11] One of these candidates, Yevgeny Khrunov, believed that Gagarin was very focused, and was demanding of himself and others when necessary.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nGagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and was a keen sportsman. Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nService in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper... I don't think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to being a keen ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team, as well as being a referee.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 April 1961, the Vostok 3KA-3 (Vostok 1) spacecraft with Gagarin aboard was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Gagarin thus became both the first human to travel into space, and the first to orbit the Earth. His call sign was Kedr (Russian: 椿, Siberian pine or Cedar).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radio communication between the launch control room and Gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch:\\r\\n\\r\\nKorolev: \\"Preliminary stage..... intermediate..... main..... lift off! We wish you a good flight. Everything is all right.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGagarin: \\"楾!\\" (Poyekhali!Let's go!).[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nGagarin's informal poyekhali! became a historical phrase in the Eastern Bloc, used to refer to the beginning of the Space Age in human history.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his post-flight report, Gagarin recalled his experience of spaceflight, having been the first human in space:\\r\\nThe feeling of weightlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with Earth conditions. Here, you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in straps. You feel as if you are suspended.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the flight, Gagarin told the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that during reentry he had whistled the tune \\"The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows\\" (Russian: \\"˾ҷ ְ, ˾ҷ \\").[20][21] The first two lines of the song are: \\"The Motherland hears, the Motherland knows/Where her son flies in the sky\\".[22] This patriotic song was written by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 (opus 86), with words by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome sources have claimed that Gagarin commented during the flight, \\"I don't see any God up here.\\" However, no such words appear in the verbatim record of his conversations with Earth-based stations during the spaceflight.[23] In a 2006 interview, Gagarin's friend Colonel Valentin Petrov stated that the cosmonaut never said such words, and that the quote originated from Nikita Khrushchev's speech at the plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU about the state's anti-religion campaign, saying \\"Gagarin flew into space, but didn't see any god there.\\"[24] Petrov also said that Gagarin had been baptised into the Orthodox Church as a child, and a 2011 Foma magazine article quoted the rector of the Orthodox church in Star City saying, \\"Gagarin baptized his elder daughter Yelena shortly before his space flight; and his family used to celebrate Christmas and Easter and keep icons in the house.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nGagarin's flight was a triumph for the Soviet space program. The announcement on the Soviet radio was made by Yuri Levitan, the same speaker who announced all major events in the Great Patriotic War. Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, and a worldwide celebrity. Newspapers around the globe published his biography and details of his flight. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was second only to World War II Victory Parades. Gagarin was escorted in a long motorcade of high-ranking officials through the streets of Moscow to the Kremlin where, in a lavish ceremony, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, by Nikita Khrushchev.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater on, Gagarin toured widely abroad. He visited Italy, Germany, Canada, Brazil, Japan, Egypt[27] and Finland to promote the Soviet Union's accomplishment of putting the first human in space. He visited the United Kingdom three months after the Vostok 1 mission, going to London and Manchester.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sudden rise to fame took its toll on Gagarin. While acquaintances say Gagarin had been a \\"sensible drinker\\", his touring schedule placed him in social situations where he was always expected to drink. Gagarin was also reportedly caught by his wife in a room with another woman, a nurse named Anna who had aided him after a boating incident earlier in the day, at a Black Sea resort in September 1961. He attempted to escape by leaving through a window and jumping off her second floor balcony, hitting his face on a kerbstone and leaving a permanent scar above his left eyebrow.[4][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1962, he began serving as a Deputy to the Soviet of the Union,[30] and was elected to the Central Committee of the Young Communist League. He later returned to Star City, the cosmonaut facility, where he spent several years working on designs for a reusable spacecraft. He became a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Forces on 12 June 1962, and received the rank of colonel on 6 November 1963.[9] Soviet officials tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident. Gagarin was backup pilot for his friend Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight, which was launched despite Gagarin's protests that additional safety precautions were necessary.[31] When Komarov's flight ended in a fatal crash, Gagarin was permanently banned from training for and participating in further spaceflights.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 20 December 1963, Gagarin had become Deputy Training Director of the Star City cosmonaut training base.[32] Two years later he was re-elected as a deputy to the SSSU, but this time to the Soviet of Nationalities.[30] Next year he began to re-qualify as a fighter pilot.[33] On 17 February 1968 he successfully defended his aerospace engineering thesis on the subject of spaceplane aerodynamic configuration, passing with flying colors.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG-15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach. The bodies of Gagarin and Seryogin were cremated and the ashes were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square.\\r\\n\\r\\nGagarin was survived by his wife Valentina, a graduate of the Orenburg medical school; and two daughters, Yelena (born 1959) and Galina (born 1961).[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cause of the crash that killed Gagarin is not entirely certain, and has been subject to speculation about conspiracy theories over the ensuing decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoviet documents declassified in March 2003 showed that the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations. The KGB's report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of airbase personnel contributed to the crash. The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded that Gagarin's aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother theory, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.[38] A similar theory, published in Air & Space magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude. This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 April 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of Gagarin. Government officials said that they saw no reason to begin a new investigation.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2011, documents from a 1968 commission set up by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to investigate the accident were declassified. Those documents revealed that the commission's original conclusion was that Gagarin or Seryogin had maneuvered sharply either to avoid a weather balloon, leading the jet into a \\"super-critical flight regime and to its stalling in complex meteorological conditions,\\" or to avoid \\"entry into the upper limit of the first layer of cloud cover\\".[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his 2004 book Two Sides of the Moon, Alexey Leonov, who was part of a State Commission established to investigate the death in 1968, recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard \\"two loud booms in the distance.\\" Corroborating other theories, his conclusion is that a Sukhoi jet (which he identifies as a Su-15 'Flagon') was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and \\"without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin's plane while breaking the sound barrier.\\" The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin's plane crashing.[42] In a June 2013 interview with Russian television network RT, Leonov said that a declassified report on the incident revealed the presence of a second, \\"unauthorized\\" Su-15 flying in the area. Leonov states that this aircraft had descended to 450 metres (1,480?ft) and that, while running afterburners, \\"the aircraft reduced its echelon at a distance of 10ÿ15 meters in the clouds, passing close to Gagarin, turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin ÿ a deep spiral, to be precise ÿ at a speed of 750 kilometers per hour.\\" As a condition of being allowed to discuss the report, however, Leonov was required to not disclose the name of the other pilot, who was reported to be 80 years old (as of 2013) and in poor health.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1957, while at the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, Gagarin met Valentina Ivanovna Goryacheva,[3] a medical technician graduate of the Orenburg Medical School.[6][8] They were married on 7 November 1957, the same day Gagarin graduated from Orenburg, and they have two daughters.[3][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nYelena Yurievna Gagarina is an art historian who has worked as the Director-General of the Moscow Kremlin Museums since 2001.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nGalina Yurievna Gagarina is a professor of economics and the department chair at Plekhanov Russian University of Economics in Moscow.[45][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from his short stature at 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in), one of Gagarin's most notable traits was his smile.[48] Many commented on how Gagarin's smile gained the attention of crowds on the frequent tours he did in the months after the Vostok 1 mission success.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nGagarin also garnered a reputation as an adept public figure. When he visited Manchester in the United Kingdom, it was pouring rain. However, Gagarin insisted that the convertible top remain down so that the cheering crowds could catch a glimpse of him. Gagarin stated, \\"If all these people have turned out to welcome me and can stand in the rain, so can I.\\" Gagarin refused an umbrella and remained standing in his open-top Bentley so that the cheering crowds could still see him.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSergei Korolev, one of the masterminds behind the early years of the Soviet space program, later said that Gagarin possessed a smile \\"that lit up the darkness of the Cold War\\".[49]\\r\\n\\r\\n12 April, the date of Gagarin's space flight, has been commemorated as a special date. Since 1962, it has been celebrated in the USSR and later in Russia and other post-Soviet states as the Cosmonautics Day. In 2011 it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2001, Yuri's Night, an international celebration, is held every 12 April to commemorate milestones in space exploration.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of buildings and other sites on Earth have been named for Gagarin.  The Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City was named in 1969. The launch pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome from which Sputnik 1 and Vostok 1 were launched, is now known as Gagarin's Start. Gagarin Raion in the Sevastopol city (Ukraine) was named after him during the period of the Soviet Union. The Air Force Academy was renamed Gagarin Air Force Academy in 1968.\\r\\n\\r\\nGagarin has been honored on the Moon by both astronauts and astronomers. He was honored by the American space program during Apollo 11 in 1969 when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left a memorial satchel containing medals commemorating Gagarin and fellow cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov on the surface.[51][52] In 1971, Apollo 15 astronauts David Scott and James Irwin left the Fallen Astronaut at their landing site as a memorial to all the American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts who died in the Space Race, with Yuri Gagarin listed among 14 others.[53][54] He is memorialized by the official naming of a 265?km crater on the Far Side after him.\\r\\n\\r\\nGagarin is memorialized in music, including a cycle of Soviet patriotic songs The Constellation Gagarin (Russian: Ѿ־^ ҷ, tr. Sozvezdie Gagarina) was written by Alexandra Pakhmutova and Nikolai Dobronravov in 1970ÿ1971.[55] The most famous of these songs referred to Gagarin's poyekhali!: He said \\"let's go!\\" He waved his hand.[17][55] He was the inspiration for the pieces \\"Hey Gagarin\\" by Jean Michel Jarre (on Mtamorphoses), \\"Gagarin\\" by Public Service Broadcasting, and \\"Gagarin, I loved you\\" by Undervud.\\r\\n\\r\\nVessels have been named for him. Soviet tracking ship Kosmonavt Yuri Gagarin was built in 1971. Armenian airline Armavia named their first Sukhoi Superjet 100 in Gagarin's honour in 2011.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two commemorative coins issued in the Soviet Union to honour the 20th and 30th anniversaries of his flight: 1 ruble coin (1981, copper-nickel) and 3 ruble coin (1991, silver). In 2001, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gagarin's flight, a series of four coins bearing his likeness was issued in Russia: 2 ruble coin (copper-nickel), 3 ruble coin (silver), 10 ruble coin (brass-copper, nickel), and 100 ruble coin (silver).[57] In 2011, Russia issued a 1,000 ruble coin (gold) and 3 ruble coin (silver) to mark the 50th anniversary of his flight.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, the Kontinental Hockey League named their championship trophy the Gagarin Cup.[59] In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Gagarin was ranked as the #6 most popular space hero, tied with Star Trek's fictional Capt. James T. Kirk.[60] The Russian docudrama, Gagarin: First in Space, was released in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral statues have been erected in his honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 June 1980, a monument to Gagarin was opened on Gagarin Square in Leninsky Avenue, Moscow. The monument is 42.4 m tall and constructed of titanium. Beside the column is a replica of the descent module used by Gagarin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011 a statue, Yuri Gagarin, was unveiled at the Admiralty Arch end of The Mall in London, opposite the permanent sculpture of James Cook. It is a copy of the statue outside Gagarin's former school in Lyubertsy.[61] In 2013 the statue was moved to a permanent location outside the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012 a statue was unveiled at the site of NASA's original spaceflight headquarters on South Wayside Drive in Houston. The sculpture, completed in 2011 by artist/cosmonaut Alexsei Leonov, was a gift to Houston by various Russian organisations. Houston Mayor Annise Parker, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were present for the dedication.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2018 a bust of Gagarin, erected on the street which bears his name in the Serbian capital Belgrade, was removed, after less than week, following an outcry over the size of its head. Locals said that the tribute, was an \\"insult\\" to Gagarin. A new work will be commissioned.[64] It was revealed that the city had had no prior knowledge of the design, and neither had the Serbian Ministry of Culture, nor the foundation which had financed it.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from these, Gagarin has also statues and monuments for example in Karaganda, Orenburg, Izhevsk, Gagarin-Smolensk Oblast, Yoshkar-Ola, Cheboksary, Druzhkivka, Tiraspol, Irkutsk, Komsomolsk-on-Amur and Nicosia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 50th anniversary of Gagarin's journey into space was marked in 2011 by tributes around the world.  A film titled First Orbit was shot from the International Space Station, combining the original flight audio with footage of the route taken by Gagarin.[66]  The Russian, American, and Italian Expedition 27 crew aboard the ISS sent a special video message to wish the people of the world a \\"Happy Yuri's Night\\", wearing shirts with an image of Gagarin.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwiss-based German watchmaker Bernhard Lederer created a limited edition of 50 Gagarin Tourbillons to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe launch of Soyuz TMA-21 on 4 April 2011 was devoted to the 50th anniversary of the first manned space mission.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nand others.\\r\\n\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was elected an honorary citizen of the following cities:\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was also awarded the golden keys to the gates of the Egyptian cities Cairo and Alexandria.","input":"Who was the first human to orbit earth?"},{"output":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nDance Moms is an American reality television series that debuted on Lifetime on July 13, 2011 and ended on October 24, 2017. Created by Collins Avenue Productions, the show originally followed the early training and careers of children in dance and show business under the tutelage of Abby Lee Miller, as well as the interactions of the instructor and the dancers with their sometimes bickering mothers. Cheryl Burke replaced Laurieann Gibson during the second half of Season 7. Miller will return to the upcoming eighth season of the show and is leading casting development.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSet originally in Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, and later in Los Angeles, California, the show is primarily filmed at the Abby Lee Dance Company (ALDC) studios.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimarily set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and later in Los Angeles, California, the show originally followed the Abby Lee Dance Company's Junior Elite Competition Team of mostly preteen girls as they traveled week-to-week to various dance competitions, winning awards and preparing for Nationals, while at the same time being prepared by Abby Lee Miller to be \\"professional, employable working dancers.\\" The series depicted the doting mothers as rivals of each other on behalf of their own daughters, often arguing with Miller and each other, and sometimes closing ranks against rival teams. Dance performances were creatively conceptualized by Miller and her dance instructors, with input from the show's producers, while choreography was done by Miller, her staff, and occasionally a guest choreographer. Various rival dance teams spurred the team's competitiveness. The show's success was often credited to the drama and conflict among Miller and the moms, along with the weekly dances and the close relationships among the girls as viewers watched them grow up and improve their skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show featured Miller as a strict dance team coach who, over the series, relied more and more on criticism, sometimes personal, to motivate the girls, with an emphasis on hard work and competition against teammates. Every week on the show, Miller used a pyramid of individual headshots and gives feedback to each girl about her ranking, previous week's performance, attitude, effort, and the behavior of the girl herself and her mother. Miller had never used a pyramid in her studio prior to Dance Moms, and when once asked about it, Miller stated, \\"I've never done that in my life. That has nothing to do with me. That's the show; they came up with that whole process.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn season 5, Miller relocated the team to Los Angeles to help build her reputation on the west coast, and while the team continued weekly competitions, the focus shifted somewhat to include preparation for acting and music business careers.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the second half of Season 7, several dancers and their mothers left the ALDC to form \\"The Irreplaceables.\\" Abby left the show several episodes later, followed by the remaining ALDC dancers and mothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral episodes featured controversial costume choices made by Miller, some of which were criticized by the moms, particularly Lukasiak and Frazier. Due to heavy criticism, the season 2 episode \\"Topless Showgirls\\", which aired on March 6, 2012, has been removed from rotation. The episode features the young dancers performing a burlesque-style routine and wearing sequined, flesh-toned bra tops and tights in an effort to make them appear nude. Miller defends her costume choice saying, \\"Everyone in the industry knows the girls are completely covered and everything's harmless.\\" Lifetime confirmed pulling the episode.[32][33] The episode is not included on the season's DVD.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nKelly Hyland was arrested in early January 2014 on charges of assaulting Miller during a dispute backstage at a dance competition held in New York City during filming for the show's fourth season in November 2013. Hyland appeared in court with Miller on January 21, 2014 and pleaded \\"not guilty\\". A hearing was scheduled for March but adjourned to May 5, 2014. Legal expert Rosemarie Arnold opined that because the episode aired on TV, Hyland's defense that the alleged assault was scripted was viable.[35] On a January 29 appearance on The View, Miller announced that Hyland and her daughters Brooke and Paige are no longer contracted with and would no longer appear on Dance Moms.[36][37] The episode featuring the incident between Hyland and Miller aired on February 11, 2014.[38] After the final episode of season 4, Christi and Chloe Lukasiak also left Dance Moms[39] because of continuing insults and dismissive treatment toward Chloe.[40] In October 2014, then-13-year-old Paige Hyland sued Miller, but Hyland's lawsuit was dismissed.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 13, 2015, Abby Lee Miller was indicted in Pittsburgh on charges of concealing her income from her performances on the show in 2012 and 2013. She was charged with bankruptcy fraud, concealment of bankruptcy assets and false bankruptcy declarations in hiding some $755,000.[42][43] In June 2016, Miller pled guilty to the charges, and entered a plea deal with the IRS.[44] In May 2017, Miller was sentenced to one year and a day in prison, followed by two years of supervised release.[45][46] Season 7 B was the last season to feature the original cast members. Christi Lukasiak revealed that the original cast wouldn't be returning for a new season.[47] After filming for Season 7 B wrapped up The Irreplaceables announced that they were going on tour.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nA spin-off series, Dance Moms: Miami, set in Miami, Florida, at Victor Smalley and Angel Armas' Stars Dance Studio, premiered on April 3, 2012,[49] and was cancelled in September 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sister program titled Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition[50] followed Miller and other dance professionals judging twelve young dancers aged 6ÿ13 years on different styles of dance, hoping to find the most versatile dancer of the group. The series premiered on October 9, 2012 and ran for two seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, Miller hosted another sister program titled Abby's Studio Rescue that followed Miller as she visited dance studios across the country to assist them to improve their choreography, studio decor, staff and other aspects.

The actual alcohol content of \\"55\\" is reported to be 2.4% ABV; by comparison, most American lagers have around 5%.\\r\\nBudweiser Brew No. 66 is a 4% alcohol by volume lager that is brewed and distributed in the United Kingdom by InBev UK Limited. Launched in July 2010, Budweiser 66 has 84 Calories in a 300?ml serving (just over 10 oz).[9]\\r\\nA 6% ABV amber lager style introduced in November 2017, inspired by a pre-prohibition recipe.\\r\\nIntroduced in October 1993[10] as \\"Ice by Budweiser\\", it has more alcohol (5.5% ABV) than Budweiser. It is best known for an advertising campaign that involved a malevolent penguin that stalked Bud Ice drinkers and stole their beer, announcing its presence by singing the \\"doo-be-doo-be-doo\\" phrase from \\"Strangers in the Night\\".\\r\\nA beer with caffeine, ginseng, guarana and alcohol. It contains 6.6% ABV. It was marketed as a caffeinated malt beverage, similar to Sparks. On June 26, 2008, Anheuser-Busch announced that it would remove caffeine and guarana from the beverage in response to concerns that the product was being marketed to consumers under the age of 21.\\r\\nA blend of Budweiser or Bud Light and Clamato. This beverage became available nationally in late 2007.[citation needed]\\r\\nA non-alcoholic beer introduced into the Canadian market in 2016. It is anticipated to be available in the United States soon.[11] In 2015, AB InBev committed to ensuring that low-alcohol and nonalcoholic beers would represent at least 20% of its global beer volume by 2025.[12]\\r\\nNon-alcoholic version of Budweiser developed for the Middle Eastern market. Also available in Green Apple and Tropical Fruits versions.\\r\\nBudweiser American Ale debuted in September 2008. The beer claims to offer complex taste without much bitterness. American Ale has a distinctive hoppier flavor than other Anheuser-Busch beers, in an attempt to capture some of the American craft beer market, although most American craft beers are hoppier. American Ale is the first beer under the Budweiser name that is brewed with a top fermenting yeast. The beer's darker color is a departure from the other Budweiser brands. Production was discontinued prior to 2015.\\r\\nBudweiser Brew Masters' Private Reserve is an all-malt lager with a honey color and robust taste. It is based on a \\"Budweiser brewmaster holiday tradition of collecting the richest part of the batch which [clarification needed] is tapped to the brew kettles to toast the holiday season.\\"[13]\\r\\nBud Dry was introduced nationally in the U.S. in April 1990[14] with the slogan of \\"Why ask why? Try Bud Dry.\\" It was originally successful in test markets and was expected to be a popular beer with the rise in light lager popularity. Dry beer is a form of pale lager where the sugars are more fully fermented to give a less sweet beer. It is also known as the Di?t-Pils style. However, after the introduction of Bud Ice in 1994, Bud Dry was not heavily marketed. Production was discontinued in December 2010.\\r\\nBud Ice Light contains 5.0% ABV and 115 calories per 12?US?fl?oz serving (1,360?kJ/L). It undergoes fractional freezing, which Bud Light does not undergo. It was discontinued in 2010.\\r\\nOn October 5, 2009, Budweiser officially released Bud Light Golden Wheat, a response to the increase in the amount of wheat beers produced from craft brewers around the country. This beer had 118 calories per 12?US?fl?oz serving (1,390?kJ/L), 8.3?grams of carbohydrates and 4.1% alcohol by volume. It was an American Hefeweizen which is based on the classic German Hefeweizen style. Production was discontinued in 2012.[15]\\r\\nAn attempt to appeal to the tastes of beer drinkers in the United Kingdom, this specially brewed beer contained 4.2% alcohol by volume. It was discontinued in 2006 after it failed to meet sales expectations.[16]\\r\\nMichelob is a 4.7% ABV pale lager developed by Adolphus Busch in 1896 as a \\"draught beer for connoisseurs\\".[17] In 1961, Anheuser-Busch produced a pasteurized version of Michelob which allowed legal shipment of the beer across state lines. Bottled beer began to be shipped soon after, and the brand was introduced in cans in 1966. Bottled Michelob was originally sold in a uniquely shaped bottle named the teardrop bottle because it resembled a water droplet. The teardrop bottle was awarded a medal from the Institute of Design in 1962. Five years later the bottle was redesigned for efficiency in the production line. This bottle was used until 2002 when it was dropped in favor of a traditional bottle. The teardrop bottle was used again from January 2007 to October 2008.\\r\\nThe company introduced Michelob Light in 1978. Michelob Classic Dark was made available in 1981 in kegs, with a bottled version following three years later. In 1991, Michelob Golden Draft was introduced to compete against Miller Genuine Draft in the Midwest.\\r\\n1997 saw the introduction of several specialty beers under the Michelob marquee. These include:\\r\\nAmberBock is a 5.1% ABV amber lager which uses roasted black barley malt in the ingredients, and which received a World Beer Cup Bronze Medal in 1998.\\r\\nFrom the beginning, the specialty beers have had a very limited distribution. The chief outlet has been through a \\"holiday sampler pack\\" produced during the Christmas holiday season. Other specialty beers that are no longer in production include Michelob Hefeweizen and Michelob Black & Tan. Some (notably Michelob AmberBock) have subsequently gone into larger production, while others have not. The brewery continues to experiment with specialty beersin 2005 an oak-aged vanilla beer was sold under the Michelob logo, available in single pints. In 2006 Michelob added a chocolate beer to the oak-aged vanilla Celebrate holiday season beer released a year earlier. Michelob also brewed Michelob Bavarian Style Wheat and Michelob Porter for its \\"holiday sampler pack\\". In 2007, Michelob launched its Seasonal Specialty Line. These include:\\r\\nThe early 21st century saw in the U.S. a demand for diet beer similar to that of the early 1970s, and in 2002 the Michelob line responded with the introduction of Michelob Ultra, advertised as being low in carbohydrates. Later Michelob Ultra Amber, a darker, more flavorful beer, was added to this sub-line.\\r\\nAccording to a report by Beer Marketer's Insights and published by USA Today on December 9, 2013, sales of Michelob Light declined by nearly 70% between 2007 and 2012. The article listed Michelob Light as one of \\"nine beers many Americans no longer drink.\\"[18]\\r\\nMichelob 5% alcohol; Michelob Golden Draft 4.7% alcohol; Michelob Golden Draft Light 4.3% alcohol; Michelob Ultra 4.2% alcohol; Michelob Ultra Amber 4.0% alcohol; Michelob: ULTRA Lime Cactus A fruit-infused light pilsner with natural lime flavor and a floral essence derived from the cactus; Michelob: ULTRA Pomegranate Raspberry A pilsner with a berry aroma, raspberry flavor, and a hint of pomegranate; Michelob: ULTRA Tuscan Orange Grapefruit A pilsner with fresh juicy orange notes and a slight pink-grapefruit finish.\\r\\nAll fruit flavors have the following nutrition content: 107 calories, 6.0g carbs, 0.5g protein and 0.0g fat, per 12 oz bottle.\\r\\nAdvertisements for Michelob Ultra feature people engaged in sporting activities. The Michelob ULTRA Open at Kingsmill and Michelob Ultra Futures Players Championship, were sponsored by Michelob Ultra. Michelob Ultra serves as a presenting sponsor of the Tour of Missouri bicycle race and sponsors the King of the Mountains jersey. Michelob also sponsors the Rugby Super League, and many of its teams have shirt sponsorships with its AmberBock brand. PGA Tour player Sergio Garca is sponsored by Michelob. Lance Armstrong signed on October 6, 2009 a three-year agreement to become Michelob Ultra's new spokesperson and ambassador, but was dropped by the company in 2012 after being accused of using performance-enhancing drugs.[19]\\r\\nMichelob sponsored several episodes of the Diggnation podcast. The hosts, Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht, sampled the beer during the show and several episodes included interviews with the company's head brew-master to discuss the different products that can be found in the sampler packs. Also, an episode of the show was filmed inside the Michelob brewery.\\r\\nMichelob is most notably famous for its late-1980s TV commercials that used the slogan, \\"The night belongs to Michelob\\", which centered on its \\"night\\" theme and used songs that had the word \\"night\\" or a form of the word \\"night\\" in its title, including \\"Move Better in the Night\\" by Roger Daltrey, \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\" by Genesis, \\"Don't You Know What the Night Can Do?\\" by Steve Winwood and a new recording of \\"After Midnight\\" by Eric Clapton. In the 1980s and 1990s, Michelob used the slogan \\"Some days are better than others\\".\\r\\nRolling Rock is a 4.5% ABV pale lager launched in 1939 by the Latrobe Brewing Company. In May, 2006, Anheuser-Busch purchased the Rolling Rock brand from InBev for $82 million and began brewing Rolling Rock at its Newark facility in mid July, 2006.[20] Other pale lagers marketed under the Rolling Rock brand name are Rock Green Light, 3.7% ABV, and Rock Light, 3.5%; the company also produces a 5% ABV amber lager, Rolling Rock Red. Ingredients are pale barley malt, rice, corn and hops.[21]\\r\\nBusch Beer, a 4.3% ABV economy brand pale lager was introduced in 1955 as Busch Bavarian Beer;[22] the brand name was changed in 1979 to Busch Beer.[23] Other beers marketed under the Busch brand name are Busch Light, a 4.1% pale lager introduced in 1989, Busch Ice, a 5.9% ice beer introduced in 1995,[24] and Busch NA, a non-alcoholic brew. Ingredients are a mix of American-grown and imported hops and a combination of malt and corn.[25] At a slightly lower price point than flagship brand Budweiser, it serves as Anheuser-Busch's second most popular brand.\\r\\nShock Top is a 5.2% ABV Belgian-style wheat ale introduced under the name Spring Heat Spiced Wheat brewed in Fort Collins, Colorado as a seasonal beer in 2006, then all year from 2007.[26][27] The beer is brewed with wheat malt, two-row barley, orange, lemon, lime peel, coriander and Cascade and Willamette hops. Entering as the Spring Heat Spiced Wheat, Shock Top Belgian White won gold and bronze medals in the Belgian Wit (White) category at the 2006 and 2007 North American Beer Awards, earning the reputation as America's Beer respectively. The brand now includes some seasonals and specialties that have replaced the Michelob Seasonals. Such varieties include Shock Top Pumpkin Wheat, Shock Top Raspberry Wheat, Shock Top Wheat IPA, Shock Top Lemon Shandy, Shock Top Honeycrisp Apple Wheat, Shock Top Chocolate Wheat, Ginger Wheat, Pretzel Wheat and Shock Top End of the World Midnight Wheat.[28] It competes directly with the MillerCoors brand Blue Moon.\\r\\nNatural Light is an economy brand 4.2% ABV reduced-calorie pale lager introduced in 1977.[29] The brand was originally called Anheuser-Busch Natural Light. In 2008 The Wall Street Journal listed it as the fifth largest selling beer in the U.S.[30] Natural Ice is an economy brand 5.9% ABV ice beer, introduced in 1995. Nearly two decades after the introduction of Natural Ice, a malt liquor, Natty Daddy (8% and 5.9ABV), was added to the market in 2012.\\r\\nJohnny Appleseed is a 5.5% ABV cider produced by Anheuser-Busch subsidiary Brokenstraw Beverage LLC and introduced in April 2014. Brokenstraw Beverage was created by Anheuser-Busch in 2014 as a corporate identity to manufacture and distribute Johnny Appleseed out of their Baldwinsville, N.Y. brewery.[31]\\r\\nLandShark Lager, brewed in Jacksonville, Florida, is a 4.6% ABV island-style lager launched in 2006 as the house lager for \\"Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville\\" restaurant chain. Under a sponsorship deal, Dolphin Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins, Florida Marlins and the Miami Hurricanes, was renamed \\"Land Shark Stadium\\" for the 2009 football season. The contract ended in early 2010, and the stadium has been renamed \\"Sun Life Stadium\\" as of January 18, 2010, in time for both the 2010 NFL Pro Bowl and Super Bowl XLIV. The stadium was renamed Hard Rock Stadium in 2016.[32][33][34]\\r\\nLandShark also has Bar & Grill locations in Pensacola, Florida, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina,[35] Atlantic City, New Jersey,[36] and Biloxi, Mississippi.\\r\\nThe name is derived from the Jimmy Buffett song \\"Fins\\", where men in a beach town trying to woo a vacationing woman are referred to as \\"sharks that can swim on the land\\".\\r\\nGoose Island started in 1988 as a brewpub in Chicago, and opened a separate bottling plant there in 1995. The brewery and its beers were purchased by Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2011.[37] The Chicago brewery continues to produce and sell small batch beers while their national offerings are made in bulk at various Anheuser-Busch facilities.\\r\\nOn February 5, 2014, it was announced that Blue Point Brewing Company was being sold to Anheuser-Busch InBev for nearly $24 million.

Under common law, the Crown is inherited by a sovereign's children or by a childless sovereign's nearest collateral line. The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701, restrict succession to the throne to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover that are in \\"communion with the Church of England\\".[1] Spouses of Roman Catholics were disqualified from 1689 until the law was amended in 2015. Protestant descendants of those excluded for being Roman Catholics are eligible.[2]\\r\\nQueen Elizabeth II is the sovereign, and her heir apparent is her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. Next in line after him is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is Prince George, the son of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, Princess Charlotte. Fifth in line is Prince Henry, the younger son of the Prince of Wales. Sixth in line is Prince Andrew, Duke of York, the Queen's second-eldest son. The first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21, and the sovereign's consort, may be appointed Counsellors of State. Counsellors of State perform some of the sovereign's duties in the United Kingdom while he or she is out of the country or temporarily incapacitated. Otherwise, individuals in the line of succession need not have specific legal or official roles.\\r\\nThe United Kingdom is one of the 16 Commonwealth realms. Each of those countries has the same person as monarch and the same order of succession. In 2011, the prime ministers of the realms agreed unanimously to adopt a common approach to amending the rules on the succession to their respective Crowns so that absolute primogeniture would apply for persons born after the date of the agreement, instead of male-preference primogeniture, and the ban on marriages to Roman Catholics would be lifted, but the monarch would still need to be in communion with the Church of England. After the necessary legislation had been enacted in accordance with each realm's constitution, the changes took effect on 26 March 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo official, complete version of the line of succession is currently maintained. The exact number, in remoter collateral lines, of the persons who would be eligible is uncertain. In 2001 genealogist William Addams Reitwiesner compiled a list of 4,973 living descendants of the Electress Sophia in order of succession, but did so disregarding Roman Catholic status.[3] When updated in January 2011, the number was more than five thousand.[4]\\r\\nThe annotated list below covers the first part of this line of succession, being limited to descendants of the sons of George V (the present Queen's grandfather). Persons named in italics are unnumbered either because they are deceased or because sources report them to be excluded from the succession. The order of the first sixteen numbered in the list is given on the official website of the British Monarchy;[1] other list numbers and exclusions are explained by annotations (\\"Notes and sources\\" below) and footnotes.\\r\\nNotes and sources:\\r\\nThe current succession law in the United Kingdom evolved from succession law in both England and Scotland. Originally in both countries, there were no fixed rules governing succession to the throne. The individual could have relied on inheritance, statute, election (by Parliament or by another body), nomination (by a reigning sovereign in his or her will), conquest or prescription (de facto possession of the Crown). It was often unclear which of these bases should take precedence; often, the outcome depended not on the legal strength of the claims, but on the political or military power of the claimants.\\r\\nHowever, over time, the default rule became male primogeniture: later monarchs coming to the throne by exception to this rule went to great lengths to explain and justify going against these rules, and to prove their rivals illegitimate. Eventually, Parliament asserted control of succession.\\r\\nIn 1485, Henry Tudor, a female-line descendant of a legitimated branch of the royal house of Lancaster, the House of Beaufort, assumed the English crown as Henry VII, after defeating Richard III, who was killed at the battle of Bosworth when leading a charge against Henry's standard. Richard was the last king of the House of York, and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. Henry declared himself king retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before his victory over Richard at Bosworth Field,[6] and caused Richard's Titulus Regius to be repealed and expunged from the Rolls of Parliament.[7] After Henry's coronation in London in October that year, his first parliament, summoned to meet at Westminster in November, enacted that \\"the inheritance of the crown should be, rest, remain and abide in the most royal person of the then sovereign lord, King Henry VII, and the heirs of his body lawfully coming.\\"[8]\\r\\nHenry VII was followed by his son, Henry VIII. Though his father descended from the Lancastrians, Henry VIII could also claim the throne through the Yorkist line, as his mother Elizabeth was the sister and heiress of Edward V. In 1542 Henry also assumed the title King of Ireland; this would pass down with the monarchs of England, and later Great Britain, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate crowns into that of the United Kingdom.\\r\\nHenry VIII's numerous marriages led to several complications over succession. Henry VIII was first married to Catherine of Aragon, by whom he had a daughter named Mary. His second marriage, to Anne Boleyn, resulted in a daughter named Elizabeth. Henry VIII had a son, Edward, by his third wife, Jane Seymour. An Act of Parliament passed in 1533 declared Mary illegitimate; another passed in 1536 did the same for Elizabeth. Though the two remained illegitimate, an Act of Parliament passed in 1544 allowed reinserting them, providing further \\"that the King should and might give, will, limit, assign, appoint or dispose the said imperial Crown and the other premises  by letters patent or last will in writing.\\" Mary and Elizabeth, under Henry VIII's will, were to be followed by descendants of the King's deceased sister Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk (he however excluded his niece Frances Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk). This will also excluded from the succession the descendants of Henry's eldest sister Margaret Tudor, who were the rulers of Scotland.\\r\\nWhen Henry VIII died in 1547, the young Edward succeeded him, becoming Edward VI. Edward VI was the first Protestant Sovereign to succeed to the rule of England. He attempted to divert the course of succession in his will to prevent his Catholic half-sister, Mary, from inheriting the throne. He excluded Mary and Elizabeth, settling on the Duchess of Suffolk's daughter, Lady Jane Grey. Jane was also originally excluded on the premise that no woman could reign over England. Nonetheless, the will, which originally referred to Jane's heirs-male, was amended to refer to Jane and her heirs-male. Upon Edward VI's death in 1553, Jane was proclaimed Queen of England. She was not universally recognised and after nine days she was overthrown by the popular Mary. As Henry VIII's will had been approved by an Act of Parliament in 1544, Edward's contravening will was unlawful and ignored.\\r\\nMary was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth, who broke with the precedents of many of her predecessors, and refused to name an heir. Whilst previous monarchs (including Henry VIII) had specifically been granted authority to settle uncertain successions in their wills, the Treasons Act 1571 asserted that Parliament had the right to settle disputes, and made it treason to deny Parliamentary authority. Wary of threats from other possible heirs, Parliament further passed the Act of Association 1584, which provided that any individual involved in attempts to murder the Sovereign would be disqualified from succeeding. (The Act was repealed in 1863.)\\r\\nThe House of Stewart (later Stuart) had ruled in Scotland since 1371. It had followed strict rules of primogeniture until the deposition and exile of Mary I in 1567; even then she was succeeded by her son, James VI.\\r\\nElizabeth I of England was succeeded by King James VI of Scotland, her first cousin twice removed, even though his succession violated Henry VIII's will, under which Lady Anne Stanley, heiress of Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk, was supposed to succeed. James asserted that hereditary right was superior to statutory provision, and as King of Scotland was powerful enough to deter any rival. He reigned as James I of England, thus effecting the Union of the Crowns, although England and Scotland remained separate sovereign states until 1707. His succession was rapidly ratified by Parliament.[9]\\r\\nJames's eldest surviving son and successor, Charles I, was overthrown and beheaded in 1649. The monarchy itself was abolished. A few years later, it was replaced by the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell, effectively a monarch with the title of Lord Protector rather than King. Cromwell had the right to name his own successor, which he exercised on his deathbed by choosing his son, Richard Cromwell. Richard was ineffective, and was quickly forced from office. Shortly afterwards, the monarchy was restored, with Charles I's son Charles II as King.\\r\\nJames II and VII, a Roman Catholic, followed his brother Charles II, despite efforts in the late 1670s to exclude him in favour of Charles's illegitimate Protestant son, the Duke of Monmouth. James was deposed when his Protestant opponents forced him to flee from England in 1688. Parliament then deemed that James had, by fleeing the realms, abdicated the thrones and offered the Crowns not to the King's infant son James but to his Protestant daughter Mary and to her husband William, who as James's nephew was the first person in the succession not descended from him. The two became joint Sovereigns (a unique circumstance in British history) as William III of England and Ireland (and II of Scotland) and Mary II of England, Scotland and Ireland. William had insisted on this unique provision as a condition of his military leadership against James.\\r\\nThe English Bill of Rights passed in 1689 determined succession to the English, Scottish and Irish Thrones. First in the line were the descendants of Mary II. Next came Mary's sister Princess Anne and her descendants. Finally, the descendants of William by any future marriage were added to the line of succession. Only Protestants were allowed to succeed to the Thrones, and those who married Roman Catholics were excluded.\\r\\nAfter Mary II died in 1694, her husband continued to reign alone until his own death in 1702. The line of succession provided for by the Bill of Rights was almost at an end; William and Mary never had any children, and Princess Anne's children had all died. Therefore, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement. The Act maintained the provision of the Bill of Rights whereby William would be succeeded by Princess Anne and her descendants, and thereafter by his own descendants from future marriages. The Act, however, declared that they would be followed by James I & VI's granddaughter Sophia, Electress and Dowager Duchess of Hanover (the daughter of James's daughter Elizabeth Stuart), and her heirs. As under the Bill of Rights, non-Protestants and those who married Roman Catholics were excluded.\\r\\nUpon William's death, Anne became Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland. Because the Parliament of England settled on Sophia, Electress of Hanover as Anne's heir-presumptive without consulting Scottish leaders, the Estates of Scotland retaliated by passing the Scottish Act of Security. The Act provided that, upon the death of Anne, the Estates would meet to select an heir to the throne of Scotland, who could not be the same person as the English Sovereign unless numerous political and economic conditions were met. Anne originally withheld the Royal Assent, but was forced to grant it when the Estates refused to raise taxes and sought to withdraw troops from the Queen's army. England's Parliament responded by passing the Alien Act 1705, which threatened to cripple Scotland's economy by cutting off trade with them. Thus, Scotland had little choice but to unite with England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707; the Crown of the new nation (along with the Crown of Ireland) was subject to the rules laid down by the English Act of Settlement.\\r\\nAnne was predeceased by Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and was therefore succeeded by the latter's son, who became George I in 1714.\\r\\nAttempts were made in the risings of 1715 and 1745 to restore Stuart claimants to the Throne, supported by those who recognised the Jacobite succession. The House of Hanover nonetheless remained undeposed, and the Crown descended in accordance with the appointed rules. In 1801, following the Acts of Union 1800, the separate crowns of Great Britain and Ireland were merged and became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Between 1811 and 1820, when George III was deemed unfit to rule, the Prince of Wales (later George IV) acted as his regent. Some years later the Regency Act 1830 made provision for a change in the line of succession had a child been born to William IV after his death, but this event did not come about.\\r\\nThe succession was next called into doubt in 1936, when Edward VIII abdicated in the same year as he succeeded to the throne immediately on his father's death. Edward was proclaimed King in January 1936,[10] and mounted the throne in the House of Lords for the first and last time at the opening of Parliament in November 1936, but he had not yet been crowned when he renounced the throne in December. Edward VIII had desired to marry Wallis Simpson, a divorcee, but the Church of England, of which the British Sovereign is Supreme Governor, would not authorise the marriage of divorcees. Consequently, Parliament passed His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, by which Edward VIII ceased to be Sovereign \\"immediately upon\\" his royal assent as King being signified in Parliament on 11 December. The Act provided that he and his descendants, if any, were not to have any \\"right, title or interest in or to the succession to the Throne\\". (In fact Edward died childless in 1972.)\\r\\nEdward's abdication was \\"a demise of the Crown\\" (in the words of the Act), and the Duke of York, his brother who was then next in the line, immediately succeeded to the throne and to its \\"rights, privileges, and dignities\\", taking the regnal name George VI. He in turn was succeeded in 1952 by his own elder daughter, Elizabeth II. By that time the monarch of the United Kingdom no longer reigned in the greater part of Ireland (which had become a republic in 1949), but was the monarch of a number of independent sovereign states (Commonwealth realms).\\r\\nIn the coronation ceremony the monarch customarily receives homage from peers of the realm, enthroned as sovereign of the United Kingdom on a chair placed for the purpose facing the altar in Westminster Abbey.[11] Each of the Commonwealth realms has the same person as monarch and, to maintain that arrangement, they have agreed to continue the same line of succession; some realms do so through domestic succession laws, while others stipulate whomever is monarch of the United Kingdom will also be monarch of that realm. In February 1952, on her accession, Elizabeth II was proclaimed as sovereign separately throughout her realms. In October 2011, the heads of government of all 16 realms agreed unanimously at a meeting held in Perth, Australia, to proposed changes to the royal succession laws that would see the order of succession for people born after 28 October 2011 governed by absolute primogeniturewherein succession passes to an individual's children according to birth order, regardless of genderinstead of male-preference primogeniture. They also agreed to lift a ban on those who marry Roman Catholics. The ban on Catholics themselves was retained to ensure that the monarch would be in communion with the Church of England.[12] The changes came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015, after legislation was made according to each realm's constitution.[13][14]\\r\\nThe Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement (restated by the Acts of Union) still govern succession to the throne. They were amended in the United Kingdom by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which was passed mainly \\"to make succession to the Crown not depend on gender\\" and \\"to make provision about Royal Marriages\\" (according to its long title), thereby implementing the Perth Agreement in the UK and in those realms that, by their laws, have as their monarch automatically whoever is monarch of the UK. Other realms passed their own legislation.\\r\\nAnyone ineligible to succeed is treated as if they were \\"naturally dead\\". That individual's descendants are not also disqualified, unless they are personally ineligible.\\r\\nThe Act of Settlement 1701 provides that Protestant \\"heirs of the body\\" (that is, legitimate descendants) of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, are eligible to succeed to the throne, unless otherwise disqualified. The meaning of heir of the body is determined by the common law rules of male preference primogeniture (the \\"male-preference\\" criterion is no longer applicable, in respect of succession to the throne, to persons born after 28 October 2011), whereby older children and their descendants inherit before younger children, and a male child takes precedence over a female sibling.[15] Children born out of wedlock and adopted children are not eligible to succeed. Illegitimate children whose parents subsequently marry are legitimated, but remain ineligible to inherit the Crown.[n 3]\\r\\nThe Royal Marriages Act 1772 (repealed by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013) further required descendants of George II to obtain the consent of the reigning monarch to marry. (The requirement did not apply to descendants of princesses who married into foreign families, as well as, from 1936, any descendants of Edward VIII,[n 4] of which there are none.) The Act provided, however, that if a dynast older than twenty-five years notified the Privy Council of his or her intention to marry without the consent of the Sovereign, then he or she may have lawfully done so after one year, unless both houses of Parliament expressly disapproved of the marriage. A marriage that contravened the Royal Marriages Act was void, and the resulting offspring illegitimate and thus ineligible to succeed, though the succession of the dynast who failed to obtain consent was not itself affected. This also had the consequence that marriage to a Roman Catholic without permission was void, so that the dynast was not disqualified from succeeding on account of being married to a Roman Catholic. Thus when the future George IV attempted to marry the Roman Catholic Maria Fitzherbert in 1785 without obtaining permission from George III he did not disqualify himself from inheriting the throne in due course.[2] A marriage voided by the 1772 act prior to its repeal remains void \\"for all purposes relating to the succession to the Crown\\" under the 2013 act.[16]\\r\\nThe constitutional crisis arising from Edward VIII's decision to marry a divorcee in 1936 led to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, which provided that Edward VIII and his descendants would have no claim to the throne.[17] The Act is no longer applicable, because Edward died in 1972 without issue.\\r\\nUnder the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act, the first six persons in line to the throne must obtain the sovereign's approval before marrying.[16] Marriage without the Sovereign's consent disqualifies the person and the person's descendants from the marriage from succeeding to the Crown,[16] but the marriage is still legally valid.\\r\\nRules relating to eligibility established by the Bill of Rights are retained under the Act of Settlement. The preamble to the Act of Settlement notes that the Bill of Rights provides \\"that all and every person and persons that then [at the time of the Bill of Right's passage] were, or afterwards should be reconciled to, or shall hold communion with the see or Church of Rome, or should profess the popish religion, or marry a papist, should be excluded.\\"[18] The Act of Settlement continues, providing \\"that all and every Person and Persons who shall  is, are or shall be reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the See or Church of Rome or shall profess the Popish religion or shall marry a papist shall be subject to such Incapacities\\"[19] as the Bill of Rights established.\\r\\nThe precise meaning of the aforementioned clauses is subject to contention. Under one interpretation, the religion of an individual at the precise moment of succession is relevant. Under another interpretation, anyone who has been a Roman Catholic at any time since 1689 (\\"then  or afterwards\\") is forever ineligible to succeed. The former interpretation allows a Roman Catholic to convert to Protestantism and succeed to the Throne just before a vacancy on the throne occurs devolving the crown on the first dynast in the line of succession; the latter does not. In either case, however, other denominations of faith are not affected; it is clear that any non-Catholic may convert to Protestantism and succeed to the Throne. It is a requirement that the monarch must be a Protestant.[1]\\r\\nThe Act of Settlement further provided that anyone who married a Roman Catholic was ineligible to succeed. The Act did not require that the spouse be Protestant; it only barred those who marry Roman Catholics. Since the passage of the Act it has been determined (in the case of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent) that an individual is not barred because his or her spouse later converts to Roman Catholicism after their marriage. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 removed the bar on individuals married to Roman Catholics, though not on Roman Catholics themselves.\\r\\nUnder the Treason Act 1702 and the Treason (Ireland) Act 1703, it is treason to \\"endeavour to deprive or hinder any person who shall be the next in succession to the crown ... from succeeding ... to the imperial crown of this realm\\". Since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the maximum penalty has been life imprisonment.\\r\\nFollowing the Perth Agreement, changes to the line of succession came into effect on 26 March 2015.[13][14] The positions of the first 27 in line remained unchanged, including Princess Anne and her children and grandchildren, until the birth of Princess Charlotte of Cambridge on 2 May 2015. The first to be affected by the changes, on the day they came into effect in March, were the children of Lady Davina Lewisher son Tne (born 2012) and her daughter Senna (born 2010)who were reversed in the order of succession, becoming 29th and 28th in line respectively.[20]\\r\\nIn the Commonwealth realms, upon the death of a sovereign, the heir apparent or heir presumptive succeeds to the throne immediately, with no need for confirmation or further ceremony.[21][n 5] Nevertheless, the Accession Council meets and decides upon the making of the accession proclamation, which by custom has for centuries been ceremonially proclaimed in public places, in London, York, Edinburgh and other cities. The anniversary is observed throughout the sovereign's reign as Accession Day, including royal gun salutes in the United Kingdom.[23]\\r\\nFormerly, a new sovereign proclaimed his or her own accession. But on the death of Elizabeth I an Accession Council met to proclaim the accession of James I to the throne of England. James was then in Scotland and reigning as King James VI of Scotland. This precedent has been followed since. Now, the Accession Council normally meets in St James's Palace. Proclamations since James I's have usually been made in the name of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Privy Council, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and citizens of the City of London and \\"other principal Gentlemen of quality\\", though there have been variations in some proclamations. The proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II was the first to make mention of representatives of members of the Commonwealth.\\r\\nUpon his or her accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths. The Bill of Rights of 1689 first required the sovereign to make a public declaration of non-belief in Roman Catholicism.[n 6] This declaration, known as the Accession Declaration, is required to be taken at either the first meeting of parliament of his or her reign (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at his or her coronation, whichever occurs first. The current wording of this declaration was adopted in 1910 as the previous wording was deemed to be controversial and overtly anti-Catholic. Rather than denouncing Roman Catholicism, the sovereign now declares him or herself to be a Protestant and that he or she will \\"uphold and maintain\\" the Protestant succession.[24] In addition to the Accession Declaration, the new sovereign is required by the Acts of Union 1707 to make an oath to \\"maintain and preserve\\" the Church of Scotland.[25] This oath is normally made at the sovereign's first meeting of the Privy Council following his or her accession. According to the Regency Act 1937, should the sovereign be under the age of 18, such oaths and declarations required to be taken by the sovereign shall be made upon his attainment of that age.[26]\\r\\nAfter a period of mourning,[27] the new sovereign is usually consecrated and crowned in Westminster Abbey. Normally, the Archbishop of Canterbury officiates, though the sovereign may designate any other bishop of the Church of England. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, Edward VIII was never crowned, yet during his short reign was the undoubted king.","input":"Who are the heirs to the british throne?"},{"output":"November 15, 2005","context":"","input":"When did carrie underwood release her first album?"},{"output":"8 June 793","context":"The Viking Age is the period from the late eighth century to the mid-11th century in European history, especially Northern European and Scandinavian history, following the Germanic Iron Age.[1] It is the period of history when Scandinavian Norsemen explored Europe by its seas and rivers for trade, raids, colonization, and conquest. In this period, the Norsemen settled in Norse Greenland, Newfoundland, and present-day Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Scotland, England, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Ukraine, Russia, and Turkey.\\r\\nViking travellers and colonists were seen at many points in history as brutal raiders. Many historical documents suggest that their invasion of other countries was retaliation in response to the encroachment upon tribal lands by Christian missionaries, and perhaps by the Saxon Wars prosecuted by Charlemagne and his kin to the south,[2][3][4][5][6] or were motivated by overpopulation, trade inequities, and the lack of viable farmland in their homeland.\\r\\nInformation about the Viking Age is drawn largely from what was written about the Vikings by their enemies, and primary sources of archaeology, supplied with secondary sources such as the Icelandic Sagas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn England, the beginning of the Viking Age is dated to 8 June 793,[7][8] when Vikings destroyed the abbey on Lindisfarne, a centre of learning on an island off the northeast coast of England in Northumberland. Monks were killed in the abbey, thrown into the sea to drown, or carried away as slaves along with the church treasures, giving rise to the traditional (but unattested) prayerA furore Normannorum libera nos, Domine, \\"Free us from the fury of the Northmen, Lord.\\"[9]\\r\\nThree Viking ships had beached in Weymouth Bay four years earlier (although due to a scribal error the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dates this event to 787 rather than 789), but that incursion may have been a trading expedition that went wrong rather than a piratical raid. Lindisfarne was different. The Viking devastation of Northumbria's Holy Island was reported by the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York, who wrote: \\"Never before in Britain has such a terror appeared\\".[10]\\r\\nVikings were portrayed as wholly violent and bloodthirsty by their enemies. In medieval English chronicles, they are described as \\"wolves among sheep\\".\\r\\nThe first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century. Pioneering scholarly works on the Viking Age reached a small readership in Britain. Linguistics traced the Viking Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. New dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled more Victorians to read the Icelandic Sagas.\\r\\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars Thomas Bartholin and Ole Worm and Swedish scholar Olaus Rudbeck were the first to use runic inscriptions and Icelandic Sagas as primary historical sources. During the Enlightenment and Nordic Renaissance, historians such as the Icelandic-Norwegian Thormodus Torf?us, Danish-Norwegian Ludvig Holberg, and Swedish Olof von Dalin developed a more \\"rational\\" and \\"pragmatic\\" approach to historical scholarship.\\r\\nBy the latter half of the 18th century, while the Icelandic sagas were still used as important historical sources, the Viking Age had again come to be regarded as a barbaric and uncivilised period in the history of the Nordic countries.\\r\\nScholars outside Scandinavia did not begin to extensively reassess the achievements of the Vikings until the 1890s, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.[11]\\r\\nUntil recently, the history of the Viking Age had largely been based on Icelandic Sagas, the history of the Danes written by Saxo Grammaticus, the Kievan Rus''s Primary Chronicle, and The War of the Irish with the Foreigners. Today, most scholars take these texts as sources not to be understood literally and are relying more on concrete archaeological findings, numismatics, and other direct scientific disciplines and methods.[12][13]\\r\\nThe Vikings who invaded western and eastern Europe were mainly pagans from the same area as present-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. They also settled in the Faroe Islands, Ireland, Iceland, peripheral Scotland (Caithness, the Hebrides and the Northern Isles), Greenland, and Canada.\\r\\nTheir North Germanic language, Old Norse, became the mother-tongue of present-day Scandinavian languages. By 801, a strong central authority appears to have been established in Jutland, and the Danes were beginning to look beyond their own territory for land, trade, and plunder.\\r\\nIn Norway, mountainous terrain and fjords formed strong natural boundaries. Communities remained independent of each other, unlike the situation in Denmark, which is lowland. By 800, some 30 small kingdoms existed in Norway.\\r\\nThe sea was the easiest way of communication between the Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world. In the eighth century, Scandinavians began to build ships of war and send them on raiding expeditions which started the Viking Age. The North Sea rovers were traders, colonisers, explorers, and plunderers.\\r\\nMany theories are posited for the cause of the Viking invasions; the will to explore likely played a major role. At the time, England, Wales, and Ireland were vulnerable to attack, being divided into many different warring kingdoms in a state of internal disarray, while the Franks were well defended. Overpopulation, especially near the Scandes, was perhaps highly influential (although this theory regarding overpopulation is disputed).[14] Technological advance like the use of iron, or a shortage of women due to selective female infanticide also had an impact.[15] Tensions caused by Frankish expansion to the south of Scandinavia, and their subsequent attacks upon the Viking peoples, may have also played a role in Viking pillaging.[citation needed] Harald I of Norway (\\"Harald Fairhair\\") had united Norway around this time and displaced many peoples. As a result, these people sought for new bases to launch counter-raids against Harald.\\r\\nVikings would plant crops after the winter and go raiding as soon as the ice melted on the sea, then return home with their loot in time to harvest the crops.[citation needed]\\r\\nDebate among scholars is ongoing as to why the Scandinavians began to expand from the eighth through 11th centuries.\\r\\nThese models constitute much of what is known about the motivations for and the causes of the Viking Age. In all likelihood, the beginning of this age was the result of some combination of the aforementioned models.\\r\\nThe earliest date given for a Viking raid is 789, when according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a group of men from Norway sailed to the Isle of Portland in Dorset (it was wrongly recorded as 787). They were mistaken for merchants by a royal official. When asked to come to the king's manor to pay a trading tax on their goods, they murdered the official.[26] The beginning of the Viking Age in the British Isles is often set at 793. It was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that the Northmen raided the important island monastery of Lindisfarne (the generally accepted date is actually 8 June, not January[8]):\\r\\nA.D. 793. This year came dreadful fore-warnings over the land of the Northumbrians, terrifying the people most woefully: these were immense sheets of light rushing through the air, and whirlwinds, and fiery dragons flying across the firmament. These tremendous tokens were soon followed by a great famine: and not long after, on the sixth day before the ides of January in the same year, the harrowing inroads of heathen men made lamentable havoc in the church of God in Holy-island (Lindisfarne), by rapine and slaughter.\\r\\nIn 794, according to the Annals of Ulster, a serious attack was made on Lindisfarne's mother-house of Iona, which was followed in 795 by raids upon the northern coast of Ireland. From bases there, the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802, causing great slaughter amongst the Cli D Brethren, and burning the abbey to the ground.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of the Franks under Charlemagne was particularly devastated by these raiders, who could sail up the Seine with near impunity. Near the end of Charlemagne's reign (and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons), a string of Norse raids began, culminating in a gradual Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as Normandy.\\r\\nThe clinker-built longships used by the Scandinavians were uniquely suited to both deep and shallow waters. They extended the reach of Norse raiders, traders, and settlers along coastlines and along the major river valleys of north-western Europe. Rurik also expanded to the east, and in 859 became ruler either by conquest or invitation by local people of the city of Novgorod (which means \\"new city\\") on the Volkhov River. His successors moved further, founding the early East Slavic state of Kievan Rus' with the capital in Kiev. This persisted until 1240, when the Mongols invaded Russia.\\r\\nOther Norse people, particularly those from the area that is now modern-day Sweden and Norway, continued south to the Black Sea and then on to Constantinople. Whenever these Viking ships ran aground in shallow waters, the Vikings reportedly turned them on their sides and dragged them across the shallows into deeper waters. The eastern connections of these \\"Varangians\\" brought Byzantine silk, coins from Samarkand, even a cowrie shell from the Red Sea, to Viking York.\\r\\nIn 884, an army of Danish Vikings was defeated at the Battle of Norditi (also called the Battle of Hilgenried Bay) on the Germanic North Sea coast by a Frisian army under Archbishop Rimbert of Bremen-Hamburg, which precipitated the complete and permanent withdrawal of the Vikings from East Frisia.\\r\\nIn 911, French King Charles the Simple was able to make an agreement with the Viking warleader Rollo, a chieftain of disputed Norwegian or Danish origins.[28] Charles gave Rollo the title of duke and granted his followers and him possession of Normandy. In return, Rollo swore fealty to Charles, converted to Christianity, and undertook to defend the northern region of France against the incursions of other Viking groups. Several generations later, the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers not only identified themselves as Norman, but also carried the Norman language (a Romance language with Germanic influence), and their Norman culture, into England in 1066. With the Norman Conquest, they became the ruling aristocracy of Anglo-Saxon England.\\r\\nIn Scandinavia, the Viking age is considered to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant religion.[citation needed] The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries. The end of the Viking era in Norway is marked by the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. Although Olafr Haraldsson's (later known as Olav the Holy) army lost the battle, Christianity spread, partly on the strength of rumours of miraculous signs after his death. Norwegians would no longer be called Vikings. In Sweden, the reign of king Olov Sk?tkonung (c. 995ÿ1020) is considered to be the transition from the Viking age to the Middle Ages, because he was the first Christian king of the Swedes, and he is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is today southwestern and central Sweden.\\r\\nThe end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by the failed invasion attempted by the Norwegian king Harald III (Haraldr Harerei), who was defeated by Saxon King Harold Godwinson in 1066 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge; in Ireland, the capture of Dublin by Strongbow and his Hiberno-Norman forces in 1171; and 1263 in Scotland by the defeat of King Hkon Hkonarson at the Battle of Largs by troops loyal to Alexander III.[citation needed] Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by another Viking descendant, William, Duke of Normandy (Normandy had been conquered by Vikings (Normans) in 911). Scotland took its present form when it regained territory from the Norse between the 13th and the 15th centuries; the Western Isles and the Isle of Man remained under Scandinavian authority until 1266. Orkney and Shetland belonged to the king of Norway as late as 1469.\\r\\nAccording to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, Viking raiders struck England in 793 and raided Lindisfarne, the monastery that held Saint Cuthbert's relics. The raiders killed the monks and captured the valuables. This raid marks the beginning of the \\"Viking Age of Invasion\\", made possible by the Viking longship. Great but sporadic violence occurred from the last decade of the eighth century on England's northern and eastern shores; Viking raids continued on a small scale across coastal England. While the initial raiding groups were small, a great amount of planning is believed to have been involved. The Norwegians raided during the winter of 840-841, rather than the usual summer, having waited on an island off Ireland. In 850, Vikings overwintered for the first time in England, on the island of Thanet, Kent. In 854, a raiding party overwintered a second time, at the Isle of Sheppey in the Thames estuary. In 864, they reverted to Thanet for their winter encampment.[29]\\r\\nThe following year ,the Great Heathen Army led by the Brothers Ivar the Boneless, Halfdan and Ubba, and also by another Viking Guthrum, arrived in East Anglia. They proceeded to cross England into Northumbria and captured York, establishing the Viking community of Jorvik, where some settled as farmers and craftsmen. Most of the English kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the Vikings. In 867, Northumbria became the northern kingdom of the coalescing Danelaw, after its conquest by the brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, who installed an Englishman, Ecgberht, as a puppet king. By 870 ,the \\"Great Summer Army\\" arrived in England, led by a Viking leader called Bagsecg and his five earls. Aided by the Great Heathen Army (which had already overrun much of England from its base in Jorvik), Bagsecg's forces, and Halfdan's forces (through an alliance), the combined Viking forces raided much of England until 871, when they planned an invasion of Wessex. On 8 January 871, Bagsecg was killed at the Battle of Ashdown along with his earls. As a result, many of the Vikings returned to northern England, where Jorvic had become the centre of the Viking kingdom, but Alfred of Wessex managed to keep them out of his country. Alfred and his successors continued to drive back the Viking frontier and take York. A new wave of Norwegian Vikings appeared in England in 947 when Eric Bloodaxe captured York.\\r\\nIn 1003, the Danish King Sweyn Forkbeard started a series of raids against England. This culminated in a full-scale invasion that led to Sweyn being crowned king of England in 1013.[30][31] Sweyn was also king of Denmark and parts of Norway at this time.[32] The throne of England passed to Edmund Ironside of Wessex after Sweyn's death in 1014. Sweyn's son, Cnut the Great, won the throne of England in 1016 through conquest. When Cnut the Great died in 1035 he was a king of Denmark, England, Norway, and parts of Sweden.[33][34] Harold Harefoot became king of England after Cnut's death and Viking rule of England ceased.\\r\\nThe Viking presence dwindled until 1066, when the invading Norsemen lost their final battle with the English at Stamford Bridge. Nineteen days later, the Normans, themselves descended from Norsemen, invaded England and defeated the weakened English army at the Battle of Hastings.\\r\\nIn 1152, Eystein II of Norway led a plundering raid down the east coast of Britain.[35]\\r\\nThe Vikings pillaged monasteries on Ireland's west coast in 795, and then spread out to cover the rest of the coastline. The north and east of the island were most affected. During the first 40 years, the raids were conducted by small, mobile Viking groups. By 830, the groups consisted of large fleets of Viking ships. From 840, the Vikings began establishing permanent bases at the coasts. Dublin was the most significant settlement in the long term. The Irish became accustomed to the Viking presence. In some cases, they became allies and married each other.\\r\\nIn 832, a Viking fleet of about 120 invaded kingdoms on Ireland's northern and eastern coasts. Some believe that the increased number of invaders coincided with Scandinavian leaders' desires to control the profitable raids on the western shores of Ireland. During the mid-830s, raids began to push deeper into Ireland, as opposed to just touching the coasts. Navigable waterways made this deeper penetration possible. After 840, the Vikings had several bases in strategic locations dispersed throughout Ireland.\\r\\nIn 838, a small Viking fleet entered the River Liffey in eastern Ireland. The Vikings set up a base, which the Irish called a longphort. This longphort eventually became Dublin. After this interaction, the Irish experienced Viking forces for about 40 years. The Vikings also established longphorts in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Wexford. The Vikings could sail through on the main river and branch off into different areas of the country.\\r\\nNorwegian Vikings and other Scandinavians conducted extensive raids in Ireland. They founded Limerick in 812, then established Waterford in 853, founded the only Viking capital city in the world outside the Nordic countries in Dublin, and founded trading ports in Cork in the 9th century. Predominantly Norwegians, and to a smaller extent other Scandinavians, settled down and intermixed with the Irish. Literature, crafts, and decorative styles in Ireland and Britain reflected West Norse culture. Vikings traded at Irish markets in Dublin and solidified Dublin as an important city. Excavations found imported fabrics from England, Byzantium, Persia, and central Asia. Dublin became so crowded by the 11th century that houses were constructed outside the town walls.\\r\\nOne of the last major battles involving Vikings was the Battle of Clontarf on 23 April 1014, in which Vikings fought both for the Irish over-king Brian Boru's army and for the Viking-led army opposing him. Irish and Viking literature depict the Battle of Clontarf as a gathering of this world and the supernatural, including witches, goblins, and demons. A Viking poem portrays the environment as strongly pagan, with chanting Valkyries deciding who would live and who would die.\\r\\nWhile few records are known, the Vikings are thought to have led their first raids in Scotland on the holy island of Iona in 794, the year following the raid on the other holy island of Lindisfarne, Northumbria.\\r\\nIn 839, a large Norse fleet invaded via the River Tay and River Earn, both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the Pictish kingdom of Fortriu. They defeated Eogn mac ܇engusa, king of the Picts, his brother Bran, and the king of the Scots of Dl Riata, ed mac Boanta, along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The sophisticated kingdom that had been built fell apart, as did the Pictish leadership, which had been stable for more than 100 years since the time of ܇engus mac Fergusa (The accession of Cined mac Ailpn as king of both Picts and Scots can be attributed to the aftermath of this event).\\r\\nBy the mid-9th century, the Norsemen had settled in Shetland, Orkney (the Nordreys- Norereyjar), the Hebrides and Isle of Man, (the Sudreys- Suereyjarthis survives in the Diocese of Sodor and Man) and parts of mainland Scotland. The Norse settlers were to some extent integrating with the local Gaelic population (see Norse-Gaels) in the Hebrides and Man. These areas were ruled over by local Jarls, originally captains of ships or hersirs. The Jarl of Orkney and Shetland, however, claimed supremacy.\\r\\nIn 875, King Harald Fairhair led a fleet from Norway to Scotland. In his attempt to unite Norway, he found that many of those opposed to his rise to power had taken refuge in the Isles. From here, they were raiding not only foreign lands but were also attacking Norway itself. He organised a fleet and was able to subdue the rebels, and in doing so brought the independent Jarls under his control, many of the rebels having fled to Iceland. He found himself ruling not only Norway, but also the Isles, Man, and parts of Scotland.\\r\\nIn 876, the Norse-Gaels of Mann and the Hebrides rebelled against Harald. A fleet was sent against them led by Ketil Flatnose to regain control. On his success, Ketil was to rule the Sudreys as a vassal of King Harald. His grandson Thorstein the Red and Sigurd the Mighty, Jarl of Orkney invaded Scotland were able to exact tribute from nearly half the kingdom until their deaths in battle. Ketil declared himself King of the Isles. Ketil was eventually outlawed and fearing the bounty on his head fled to Iceland.\\r\\nThe Norse-Gaelic Kings of the Isles continued to act semi independently, in 973 forming a defensive pact with the Kings of Scotland and Strathclyde. In 1095, the King of Mann and the Isles Godred Crovan was killed by Magnus Barelegs, King of Norway. Magnus and King Edgar of Scotland agreed on a treaty. The islands would be controlled by Norway, but mainland territories would go to Scotland. The King of Norway nominally continued to be king of the Isles and Man. However, in 1156, The kingdom was split into two. The Western Isles and Man continued as to be called the \\"Kingdom of Man and the Isles\\", but the Inner Hebrides came under the influence of Somerled, a Gaelic speaker, who was styled 'King of the Hebrides'. His kingdom was to develop latterly into the Lordship of the Isles.\\r\\nIn eastern Aberdeenshire, the Danes invaded at least as far north as the area near Cruden Bay.[36]\\r\\nThe Jarls of Orkney continued to rule much of northern Scotland until 1196, when Harald Maddadsson agreed to pay tribute to William the Lion, King of Scots, for his territories on the mainland.\\r\\nThe end of the Viking age proper in Scotland is generally considered to be in 1266. In 1263, King Haakon IV of Norway, in retaliation for a Scots expedition to Skye, arrived on the west coast with a fleet from Norway and Orkney. His fleet linked up with those of King Magnus of Man and King Dougal of the Hebrides. After peace talks failed, his forces met with the Scots at Largs, in Ayrshire. The battle proved indecisive, but it did ensure that the Norse were not able to mount a further attack that year. Haakon died overwintering in Orkney, and by 1266, his son Magnus the Law-mender ceded the Kingdom of Man and the Isles, with all territories on mainland Scotland to Alexander III, through the Treaty of Perth.\\r\\nOrkney and Shetland continued to be ruled as autonomous Jarldoms under Norway until 1468, when King Christian I pledged them as security on the dowry of his daughter, who was betrothed to James III of Scotland. Although attempts were made during the 17th and 18th centuries to redeem Shetland, without success,[37] and Charles II ratifying the pawning in the 1669 Act for annexation of Orkney and Shetland to the Crown, explicitly exempting them from any \\"dissolution of His Majesty's lands\\",[38] they are currently considered as being officially part of the United Kingdom.[39][40]\\r\\nIncursions in Wales were decisively reversed at the Battle of Buttington in Powys, 893, when a combined Welsh and Mercian army under ?thelred, Lord of the Mercians, defeated a Danish band.\\r\\nWales was not colonised by the Vikings as heavily as eastern England. The Vikings did, however, settle in the south around St. David's, Haverfordwest, and Gower, among other places. Place names such as Skokholm, Skomer, and Swansea remain as evidence of the Norse settlement.[41] The Vikings, however, did not subdue the Welsh mountain kingdoms.\\r\\nAccording to Sagas, Iceland was discovered by Naddodd, a Viking from the Faroe Islands, after which it was settled by mostly Norwegians fleeing the oppressive rule of Harald Fairhair (late 9th century). While harsh, the land allowed for a pastoral farming life familiar to the Norse. According to the saga of Erik the Red, when Erik was exiled from Iceland, he sailed west and pioneered Greenland.\\r\\nThe Viking-Age settlements in Greenland were established in the sheltered fjords of the southern and western coast. They settled in three separate areas along roughly 650?km (350?nmi; 400?mi) of the western coast. While harsh, the microclimates along some fjords allowed for a pastoral lifestyle similar to that of Iceland, until the climate changed for the worse with the Little Ice Age around 1400.[42]\\r\\nKvenland, known as Cwenland, K?nland, and similar terms in medieval sources, is an ancient name for an area in Scandinavia and Fennoscandia. A contemporary reference to Kvenland is provided in an Old English account written in the 9th century. It used the information provided by the Norwegian adventurer and traveller named Ohthere. Kvenland, in that or close to that spelling, is also known from Nordic sources, primarily Icelandic, but also one that was possibly written in the modern-day area of Norway.\\r\\nAll the remaining Nordic sources discussing Kvenland, using that or close to that spelling, date to the 12th and 13th centuries, but some of themin part at leastare believed to be rewrites of older texts. Other references and possible references to Kvenland by other names and/or spellings are discussed in the main article of Kvenland.\\r\\nThe Varangians or Varyags (Russian, Ukrainian: , Varyagi; Belarusian: ?, Varahi; Greek: ?ϫ, ϫ?, Varangoi) sometimes referred to as Variagians were Scandinavians, often Swedes, who migrated eastwards and southwards through what is now Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine mainly in the 9th and 10th centuries. Engaging in trade, piracy, and mercenary activities, they roamed the river systems and portages of Gardariki, reaching the Caspian Sea and Constantinople. Contemporary English publications also use the name \\"Viking\\" for early Varangians in some contexts.[43][44]\\r\\nThe term Varangian remained in usage in the Byzantine Empire until the 13th century, largely disconnected from its Scandinavian roots by then. Having settled Aldeigja (Ladoga) in the 750s, Scandinavian colonists were probably an element in the early ethnogenesis of the Rus' people, and likely played a role in the formation of the Rus' Khaganate.[45][46] The Varangians (Varyags, in Old East Slavic) are first mentioned by the Primary Chronicle as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay Danegeld in 859, and the Curonians of Grobin faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\\r\\nIn 862, the Finnic and Slavic tribes rebelled against the Varangian Rus, driving them overseas back to Scandinavia, but soon started to conflict with each other[citation needed]. The disorder prompted the tribes to invite back the Varangian Rus \\"to come and rule them\\" and bring peace to the region[citation needed]. This was a somewhat bilateral relation with the Varagians defending the cities that they ruled. Led by Rurik and his brothers Truvor and Sineus, the invited Varangians (called Rus') settled around the town of Novgorod (Holmgard).\\r\\nIn the 9th century, the Rus' operated the Volga trade route, which connected Northern Russia (Gardariki) with the Middle East (Serkland). As the Volga route declined by the end of the century, the Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks rapidly overtook it in popularity. Apart from Ladoga and Novgorod, Gnezdovo and Gotland were major centres for Varangian trade.[47]\\r\\nWestern historians tend to agree with the Primary Chronicle that these Scandinavians founded Kievan Rus' in the 880s and gave their name to the land.[48] Many Slavic scholars are opposed to this theory of Germanic[clarification needed] influence on the Rus' and have suggested alternative scenarios for this part of Eastern European history.\\r\\nIn contrast to the intense Scandinavian influence in Normandy and the British Isles, Varangian culture did not survive to a great extent in the East. Instead, the Varangian ruling classes of the two powerful city-states of Novgorod and Kiev were thoroughly Slavicised by the end of the 10th century. Old Norse was spoken in one district of Novgorod, however, until the 13th century.\\r\\nViking Age Scandinavian settlements were set up along the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, primarily for trade purposes. Their appearance coincides with the settlement and consolidation of the Slavic tribes in the respective areas.[49] Scandinavians had contacts to the Slavs since their very immigration, these first contacts were soon followed by both the construction of Scandinavian emporia and Slavic burghs in their vicinity.[50] The Scandinavian settlements were larger than the early Slavic ones, their craftsmen had a considerably higher productivity, and in contrast to the early Slavs, the Scandinavians were capable of seafaring.[50] Their importance for trade with the Slavic world however was limited to the coastal regions and their hinterlands.[51]\\r\\nScandinavian settlements at the Mecklenburgian coast include Reric (Gro? Str?mkendorf) on the eastern coast of Wismar Bay,[52] and Dierkow (near Rostock).[53] Reric was set up around the year 700,[52] but following later warfare between Obodrites and Danes, the merchants were resettled to Haithabu.[53] Dierkow prospered from the late 8th to the early 9th century.[50]\\r\\nScandinavian settlements at the Pomeranian coast include Wolin (on the isle of Wolin), Ralswiek (on the isle of Rgen), Altes Lager Menzlin (at the lower Peene river),[54] and Bardy-?wielubie near modern Ko?obrzeg.[55] Menzlin was set up in the mid-8th century.[52] Wolin and Ralswiek began to prosper in the course of the 9th century.[53] A merchants' settlement has also been suggested near Arkona, but no archeological evidence supports this theory.[56] Menzlin and Bardy-?wielubie were vacated in the late 9th century,[57] Ralswiek made it into the new millennium, but at the time when written chronicles reported the site in the 12th century it had lost all its importance.[53] Wolin, thought to be identical with legendary Vineta and semilegendary Jomsborg, base of the Jomsvikings, was destroyed by the Danes in the 12th century.\\r\\nScandinavian arrowheads from the 8th and 9th centuries were found between the coast and the lake chains in the Mecklenburgian and Pomeranian hinterlands, pointing at periods of warfare between the Scandinavians and Slavs.[53]\\r\\nScandinavian settlements existed along the southeastern Baltic coast in Truso and Kaup (Old Prussia), and in Grobin (Courland, Latvia).\\r\\nThe French region of Normandy takes its name from the Viking invaders who were called Normanni, which means men of the North'. Today, nordmann (pron. Norman) in the Norwegian language, denotes a Norwegian person.\\r\\nThe first Viking raids began between 790 and 800 along the coasts of western France. They were carried out primarily in the summer, as the Vikings wintered in Scandinavia. Several coastal areas were lost to Francia during the reign of Louis the Pious (814ÿ840). But the Vikings took advantage of the quarrels in the royal family caused after the death of Louis the Pious to settle their first colony in the south-west (Gascony) of the kingdom of Francia, which was more or less abandoned by the Frankish kings after their two defeats at Roncevaux. The incursions in 841 caused severe damage to Rouen and Jumiges. The Viking attackers sought to capture the treasures stored at monasteries, easy prey given the monks' lack of defensive capacity. In 845 an expedition up the Seine reached Paris. The presence of Carolingian deniers of ca 847, found in 1871 among a hoard at Mullaghboden, County Limerick, where coins were neither minted nor normally used in trade, probably represents booty from the raids of 843ÿ6.[58] After 851, Vikings began to stay in the lower Seine valley for the winter. Twice more in the 860s Vikings rowed to Paris, leaving only when they acquired sufficient loot or bribes from the Carolingian rulers.\\r\\nThe Carolingian kings tended to have contradictory politics, which had severe consequences. In 867, Charles the Bald signed the Treaty of Compigne, by which he agreed to yield the Cotentin Peninsula to the Breton king Salomon, on the condition that Salomon would take an oath of fidelity and fight as an ally against the Vikings. Nevertheless, in 911 the Viking leader Rollo forced Charles the Simple to sign the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, under which Charles gave Rouen and the area of present-day Upper Normandy to Rollo, establishing the Duchy of Normandy. In exchange, Rollo pledged vassalage to Charles in 940, agreed to be baptised, and vowed to guard the estuaries of the Seine from further Viking attacks, even though the exact opposite was often the case. The Duchy of Normandy also annexed further areas in Northern France, expanding the territory which was originally negotiated.\\r\\nWhile many buildings were pillaged, burned, or destroyed by the Viking raids, ecclesiastical sources may have been overly negative as no city was completely destroyed.[citation needed] On the other hand, many monasteries were pillaged and all the abbeys were destroyed. Rollo and his successors brought about rapid recoveries from the raids.\\r\\nThe Scandinavian colonization was principally Norwegian and Danish under the leadership of Rollo. A few Swedes were present. The merging of the Scandinavian and native elements contributed to the creation of one of the most powerful feudal states of Western Europe. The naval ability of the Normans would allow them to conquer England and southern Italy, and play a key role in the Crusades.\\r\\nIn 860, according to an account by the Norman monk Dudo of Saint-Quentin, a Viking fleet, probably under Bj?rn Ironside and Hastein, landed at the Ligurian port of Luni and sacked the city. The Vikings then moved another 60 miles down the Tuscan coast to the mouth of the Arno, sacking Pisa and then, following the river upstream, also the hill-town of Fiesole above Florence; and others victory around the Mediterranean (including in Sicily and North Africa).[59]\\r\\nMany Anglo-Danish and Varangian mercenaries fought in Southern Italy, including Harald Hardrada and William de Hauteville who conquered parts of Sicily between 1038 and 1040,[60][61] and Edgar the ?theling who participated in the Norman conquest of southern Italy.[62] Runestones were raised in Sweden in memory of warriors who died in Langbarealand (Land of the Lombards), the Old Norse name for southern Italy.[63]\\r\\nAfter 842, when the Vikings set up a permanent base at the mouth of the Loire river, they could strike as far as northern Spain.[64] They attacked Cdiz in 844. In some of their raids they were crushed either by Kingdom of Asturias or Emirate armies. These Vikings were Hispanicised in all Christian kingdoms, while they kept their ethnic identity and culture in Al-Andalus.[65]\\r\\nIn 1015, a Viking fleet entered the river Minho and sacked the episcopal city of Tui (Galicia); no new bishop was appointed until 1070.[66]\\r\\nIn 844, many dozens of drakkars appeared in the \\"Mar da Palha\\" (\\"the Sea of Straw\\", mouth of the Tagus river). After a siege, the Vikings conquered Lisbon (at the time, the city was under Muslim rule and known as Lashbuna). They left after 13 days, following a resistance led by Alah Ibn Hazm and the city's inhabitants. Another raid was attempted in 966, without success.\\r\\nIn about 986, the Norwegian Vikings Bjarni Herj܇lfsson, Leif Ericson and T܇rfinnr Karlsefni from Greenland reached North America, over 500 years before Christopher Columbus, and they attempted to settle the land they called Vinland. They created a small settlement on the northern peninsula of present-day Newfoundland, near L'Anse aux Meadows. Conflict with indigenous peoples and lack of support from Greenland brought the Vinland colony to an end within a few years. The archaeological remains are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[67]\\r\\nThe long-term linguistic effect of the Viking settlements in England was threefold: over a thousand Old Norse words eventually became part of Standard English; numerous places in the East and North-east of England have Danish names, and many English personal names are of Scandinavian origin.[68] Scandinavian words that entered the English language included landing, score, beck, fellow, take, busting and steersman.[68] The vast majority of loan words did not appear in documents until the early 12th century; these included many modern words which used sk- sounds, such as skirt, sky, and skin; other words appearing in written sources at this time included again, awkward, birth, cake, dregs, fog, freckles, gasp, law, moss, neck, ransack, root, scowl, sister, seat, sly, smile, want, weak and window from Old Norse meaning \\"wind-eye\\".[68] Some of the words that came into use are among the most common in English, such as to go, to come, to sit, to listen, to eat, both, same, get and give. The system of personal pronouns was affected, with they, them and their replacing the earlier forms. Old Norse influenced the verb to be; the replacement of sindon by are is almost certainly Scandinavian in origin, as is the third-person-singular ending -s in the present tense of verbs.[68]\\r\\nThere are more than 1,500 Scandinavian place names in England, mainly in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (within the former boundaries of the Danelaw): over 600 end in -by, the Scandinavian word for \\"village\\"for example Grimsby, Naseby and Whitby;[69] many others end in -thorpe (\\"farm\\"), -thwaite (\\"clearing\\"), and -toft (\\"homestead\\").[68]\\r\\nThe distribution of family names showing Scandinavian influence is still, as an analysis of names ending in -son reveals, concentrated in the north and east, corresponding to areas of former Viking settlement. Early medieval records indicate that over 60% of personal names in Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire showed Scandinavian influence.[68]\\r\\nThe Vikings were equipped with the technologically superior longships; for purposes of conducting trade however, another type of ship, the knarr, wider and deeper in draft, were customarily used. The Vikings were competent sailors, adept in land warfare as well as at sea, and they often struck at accessible and poorly defended targets, usually with near impunity. The effectiveness of these tactics earned Vikings a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates. Chroniclers paid little attention to other aspects of medieval Scandinavian culture. This slant was accentuated by the absence of contemporary primary source documentation from within the Viking Age communities themselves. Little documentary evidence was available until later, when Christian sources began to contribute. As historians and archaeologists have developed more resources to challenge the one-sided descriptions of the chroniclers, a more balanced picture of the Norsemen has become apparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vikings used their longships to travel vast distances and attain certain tactical advantages in battle. They could perform highly efficient hit-and-run attacks, in which they quickly approached a target, then left as rapidly as possible before a counter-offensive could be launched. Because of the ships' negligible draft, the Vikings could sail in shallow waters, allowing them to invade far inland along rivers. Not only were the ships light and agile, but they were light enough to be carried over land from one river system to another. \\"Under sail, the same boats could tackle open water and cross the unexplored wastes of the North Atlantic.\\". [70].The ships' speed was also prodigious for the time, estimated at a maximum of 14ÿ15 knots (26ÿ28?km/h). The use of the longships ended when technology changed, and ships began to be constructed using saws instead of axes. This led to a lesser quality of ships.\\r\\nWhile battles at sea were rare, they would occasionally occur when Viking ships attempted to board European merchant vessels in Scandinavian waters. When larger scale battles ensued, Viking crews would rope together all nearby ships and slowly proceed towards the enemy targets. While advancing, the warriors hurled spears, arrows, and other projectiles at the opponents. When the ships were sufficiently close, melee combat would ensue using axes, swords, and spears until the enemy ship could be easily boarded. The roping technique allowed Viking crews to remain strong in numbers and act as a unit, but this uniformity also created problems. A Viking ship in the line could not retreat or pursue hostiles without breaking the formation and cutting the ropes, which weakened the overall Viking fleet and was a burdensome task to perform in the heat of battle. In general, these tactics enabled Vikings to quickly destroy the meagre opposition posted during raids.[71]\\r\\nTogether with an increasing centralisation of government in the Scandinavian countries, the old system of leidanga fleet mobilisation system, where every skipen (ship community) had to deliver one ship and crewwas discontinued. Changes in shipbuilding in the rest of Europe led to the demise of the longship for military purposes. By the 11th and 12th centuries, European fighting ships were built with raised platforms fore and aft, from which archers could shoot down into the relatively low longships.\\r\\nThe nautical achievements of the Vikings were exceptional, partly as it is thought that they made use of calcite \\"sunstones\\" to find the sun's location while at sea, even on cloudy or foggy days.[72] For instance, they made distance tables for sea voyages that were remarkably precise. They have been found to differ only 2ÿ4% from modern satellite measurements, even on such long distances as across the Atlantic Ocean.[citation needed].\\r\\nThe archaeological find known as the Visby lenses from the Swedish island of Gotland may be components of a telescope. It appears to date from long before the invention of the telescope in the 17th century.[73] Recent evidence suggests that the Vikings also made use of an optical compass as a navigation aid, using the light-splitting and polarisation-filtering properties of Iceland spar to find the location of the sun when it was not directly visible.[74]\\r\\nAn archaeological find in Sweden consists of a bone fragment fixated with in-operated material[clarification needed]; the piece is as yet undated. These bones might be the remains of a trader from the Middle East.\\r\\nSome of the most important trading ports founded by the Norse during the period, include both existing and former cities such as Aarhus (Denmark), Ribe (Denmark), Hedeby (Germany), Vineta (Pomerania), Truso (Poland), Bj?rgvin (Norway), Kaupang (Norway), Skiringssal (Norway), Birka (Sweden), Bordeaux (France), York (England), Dublin (Ireland) and Aldeigjuborg (Russia).\\r\\nOne important centre of trade was at Hedeby. Close to the border with the Franks, it was effectively a crossroads between the cultures, until its eventual destruction by the Norwegians in an internecine dispute around 1050. York was the centre of the kingdom of J܇rvk from 866, and discoveries there (e.g. a silk cap, a counterfeit of a coin from Samarkand and a cowry shell from the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf) suggest that Scandinavian trade connections in the 10th century reached beyond Byzantium. However, those items could also have been Byzantine imports, and there is no reason to assume that the Varangians travelled significantly beyond Byzantium and the Caspian Sea.\\r\\nEngland\\r\\nIreland\\r\\nIsle of Man\\r\\nScotland\\r\\nAnd they came to the church of Lindisfarne, laid everything waste with grievous plundering, trampled the holy places with polluted feet, dug up the altars, and seized all the treasures of the holy church. They killed some of the brothers; some they took away with them in fetters; many they drove out, naked and loaded with insults; and some they drowned in the sea.\\"\\r\\nMagnus Magnusson, Vikings!, p. 32.","input":"When did the vikings first come to britain?"},{"output":"Oregon","context":"The solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, dubbed \\"The Great American Eclipse\\" by the media,[1][2][3][4][5] was a total eclipse visible within a band across the entire contiguous United States, passing from the Pacific to the Atlantic coasts. As a partial solar eclipse, it was visible on land from Nunavut in northern Canada to as far south as northern South America. In northwestern Europe and Africa, it was partially visible in the late evening. In Asia it was visible only at the eastern extremity, the Chukchi Peninsula.\\r\\nPrior to this event, no solar eclipse had been visible across the entire contiguous United States since June 8, 1918; not since the February 1979 eclipse had a total eclipse been visible from anywhere in the mainland United States.[6] The path of totality touched 14 states, and the rest of the U.S. had a partial eclipse.[6] The area of the path of totality was about 16 percent of the area of the United States,[7] with most of this area over the ocean, not land. The event's shadow began to cover land on the Oregon coast as a partial eclipse at 4:05?p.m. UTC (9:05?a.m. PDT), with the total eclipse beginning there at 5:16?p.m. UTC (10:16?a.m. PDT); the total eclipse's land coverage ended along the South Carolina coast at about 6:44?p.m. UTC (2:44?p.m. EDT).[6] Visibility as a partial eclipse in Honolulu, Hawaii began with sunrise at 4:20?p.m. UTC (6:20?a.m. HST) and ended by 5:25?p.m. UTC (7:25?a.m. HST).[8]\\r\\nThis total solar eclipse marked the first such event in the smartphone and social media era in America. Information, personal communication, and photography were widely available as never before, capturing popular attention and enhancing the social experience.\\r\\nLogistical problems were expected with the influx of visitors, especially for smaller communities.[9] The sale of counterfeit eclipse glasses was also anticipated to be a hazard for eye injuries.[10]\\r\\nFuture total solar eclipses will cross the United States in April 2024 (12 states) and August 2045 (10 states), and annular solar eclipseswherein the Moon appears smaller than the Sunwill occur in October 2023 (9 states) and June 2048 (9 states).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total eclipse had a magnitude of 1.0306 and was visible within a narrow corridor 70 miles (110?km) wide, crossing fourteen of the contiguous United States: Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.[11][12] It was first seen from land in the U.S. shortly after 10:15?a.m. PDT (17:15?UTC) at Oregon's Pacific coast, and then it progressed eastward through Salem, Oregon; Idaho Falls, Idaho; Casper, Wyoming; Lincoln, Nebraska; Kansas City, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; Hopkinsville, Kentucky; Nashville, Tennessee; Columbia, South Carolina about 2:41?p.m.;[13] and finally Charleston, South Carolina. A partial eclipse was seen for a greater time period, beginning shortly after 9:00?a.m. PDT along the Pacific Coast of Oregon. Weather forecasts predicted clear skies in Western U.S. and some Eastern states, but clouds in the Midwest and East Coast.[14]\\r\\nThe longest ground duration of totality was 2 minutes 41.6 seconds at about 37350N 8970W? / ?37.58333N 89.11667W? / 37.58333; -89.11667 in Giant City State Park, just south of Carbondale, Illinois, and the greatest extent (width) was at 36580N 874018W? / ?36.96667N 87.67167W? / 36.96667; -87.67167 near the village of Cerulean, Kentucky, located in between Hopkinsville and Princeton.[15] This was the first total solar eclipse visible from the Southeastern United States since the solar eclipse of March 7, 1970. Two NASA WB-57F flew above the clouds, prolonging the observation time spent in the umbra.[16] A partial solar eclipse was seen from the much broader path of the Moon's penumbra, including all of North America, particularly areas just south of the totality pass, where the eclipse lasted about 3ÿ5 hours, northern South America, Western Europe, and some of Africa and north-east Asia.\\r\\nDuring the eclipse for a long span of its path of totality, several bright stars and four planets were visible. The star-system Regulus was visible slightly to the west of the Sun. Mars was 8 degrees to the right, and Venus 34 degrees right. Mercury was 10 degrees left, and Jupiter 51 degrees left.[17]\\r\\nThis was the first total solar eclipse visible from the United States since that of July 11, 1991[18]which was seen only from part of Hawaii[19]and the first visible from the contiguous United States since 1979.[20] An eclipse of comparable length (up to 3 minutes, 8 seconds, with the longest eclipse being 6 minutes and 54 seconds) occurred over the contiguous United States on March 7, 1970 along the southern portions of the Eastern Seaboard, from Florida to Virginia.[21]\\r\\nThe path of totality of the solar eclipse of February 26, 1979 crossed only the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and North Dakota. Many enthusiasts traveled to the Pacific Northwest to view the eclipse, since it would be the last chance to view such an eclipse in the contiguous United States for almost four decades.[22][23]\\r\\nSome American scientists and interested amateurs who wanted to experience a total eclipse participated in a four-day Atlantic Ocean cruise to view the solar eclipse of July 10, 1972 as it passed near Nova Scotia. (This is referenced in the Carly Simon hit song \\"You're So Vain\\" in the lyric, \\"Then you flew your Lear Jet up to Nova Scotia to see the total eclipse of the Sun.\\") Organizers of the cruise advertised in astronomical journals and in planetarium announcements, emphasizing the rarity of the event.[24]\\r\\nThe August 2017 eclipse was the first with a path of totality crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the U.S. since 1918. Also, its path of totality made landfall exclusively within the United States, making it the first such eclipse since the country's declaration of independence in 1776. Prior to this, the path of totality of the eclipse of June 13, 1257, was the last to make landfall exclusively on lands currently part of the United States.[25]\\r\\nThe path of the 2017 eclipse crosses with the path of the upcoming total solar eclipse of April 8, 2024, with the intersection of the two paths being in southern Illinois in Makanda Township at Cedar Lake, just south of Carbondale. An area of about 9,000 square miles, including the cities of Makanda, Carbondale, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Paducah, Kentucky, will thus experience two total solar eclipses within a span of less than seven years.[citation needed] The cities of Benton, Carbondale, Chester, Harrisburg, Marion, and Metropolis in Illinois; Cape Girardeau, Farmington, and Perryville in Missouri, as well as Paducah, Kentucky, will also be in the path of the 2024 eclipse, thereby earning the distinction of witnessing two total solar eclipses in seven years.\\r\\nThe solar eclipse of August 12, 2045 will have a very similar path of totality over the U.S. to the 2017 eclipse: about 400?km (250?mi) to the southwest, also crossing the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the country; however, totality will be more than twice as long.[26]\\r\\nA partial eclipse was visible across the width of Canada, ranging from 89 percent in Victoria, British Columbia to 11 percent in Resolute, Nunavut.[83] In Ottawa viewing parties were held at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum.[84] In Toronto, viewing parties were held at the CNE and the Ontario Science Centre[85]\\r\\nA partial eclipse was visible from Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean islands, and ships and aircraft in and above the adjacent oceans,[86] as well as the northern countries of South America such as Colombia, Venezuela, and several others.[citation needed]\\r\\nA partial eclipse was visible only in the Chukchi Peninsula.[87] In Anadyr, the maximum obscuration was 27,82%.[88]\\r\\nIn some locations in West Africa and western North Africa, a partial eclipse was seen just before and during sunset.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn northwestern Europe, the eclipse was only visible partially, in the evening or at sunset. Only those in Iceland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and the Portuguese Azores archipelago saw the eclipse from beginning to end; in the rest of the UK, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, and Portugal, sunset occurred before the end of the eclipse. In Germany, the beginning of the eclipse was visible just at sunset only in the extreme northwest of the country. In all regions east of the orange line in the map, the eclipse was not visible.[89]\\r\\nA large number of media outlets broadcast coverage of the eclipse, including television and internet outlets. NASA announced plans to offer streaming coverage through its NASA TV and NASA Edge outlets, using cameras stationed on the ground along the path of totality, along with cameras on high-altitude balloons, jets, and coverage from the International Space Station; NASA stated that \\"never before will a celestial event be viewed by so many and explored from so many vantage pointsfrom space, from the air, and from the ground.\\"[90] ABC, CBS, and NBC announced that they would respectively broadcast live television specials to cover the eclipse with correspondents stationed across the path of totality, along with CNN, Fox News Channel, Science, and The Weather Channel. The PBS series Nova presented streaming coverage on Facebook hosted by Miles O'Brien, and aired a special episode chronicling the event\\"Eclipse Over America\\"later in the day (which marked the fastest production turnaround time in Nova history).[91][92]\\r\\nOther institutions and services also announced plans to stream their perspectives of the eclipse, including the Exploratorium in San Francisco, the Elephant Sanctuary of Hohenwald, Tennessee, the Slooh robotic telescope app, and The Virtual Telescope Project. The Eclipse Ballooning Project, a consortium of schools and colleges that sent 50 high-altitude balloons into the sky during the eclipse to conduct experiments, provided streams of footage and GPS tracking of its launches.[90][93] Contact with one balloon with $13,000 of scientific equipment, launched under the aegis of the LGF Museum of Natural History near Vale, Oregon, was lost at 20,000 feet (6,100?m). Given that the balloon was believed to have burst at 100,000 feet (30,000?m) it could have parachuted down anywhere from eastern Oregon to Caldwell, Idaho (most likely) to Sun Valley, Idaho; a $1,000 reward is offered for its recovery.[94]\\r\\nThe National Solar Observatory organized Citizen CATE volunteers to man 60 identical telescopes and instrumentation packages along the totality path to study changes in the corona over the duration of the eclipse.\\r\\nIn orbit, the satellites Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the International Space Station, the Solar Dynamics Observatory, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, and Hinode gathered data from the eclipse.[95]\\r\\nA viewing party was held at the White House, during which President Donald Trump appeared on the Truman Balcony with First Lady Melania Trump. With the sun partially eclipsed, President Trump looked briefly in the general direction of the sun before using solar viewing glasses.[96]\\r\\nThe rapper Joey Badass boasted of watching the solar eclipse without viewing glasses, considering that \\"our ancestors ain't have no fancy eyewear [and] they ain't all go blind\\". Unlike the US president, he did not wear viewing glasses during the entire eclipse. Later, he complained of vision problems and had to cancel his Cleveland, Chicago & Toronto shows on the Everybody Tour, due to \\"unforeseen circumstances\\".[97]\\r\\nThe eclipse generated reports of abnormal behavior in animal and plant life. Some farm animals including domestic chickens came out from under their coops and began grooming, usually an evening activity. Horses also displayed increased whinnying, running, and jumping after the event. Cicadas were reported to grow louder before going silent during totality. Various birds were also observed flying in unusually large formations. Flowers such as the Hibiscus closed their petals which typically happens at night, before opening again after the solar event.[98]\\r\\nNASA reported over 90 million page views of the eclipse on its websites, making it the agency's biggest online event ever, beating the previous web traffic record about seven times over.[99]\\r\\nIn the months leading up to the eclipse, many counterfeit glasses were put up for sale. Effective eclipse glasses must not only block most visible light, but most UV and infrared light as well. For visible light, the user should only be able to see the Sun, sunglint reflected off shiny metal, halogen bulbs, the filament in unfrosted incandescent bulbs, and similarly intense sources. Determining whether the glasses effectively block enough UV and infrared light requires the use of spectrophotometer, which is a rather expensive piece of lab equipment.[10][100]\\r\\nThe eye's retina lacks pain receptors, and thus damage can occur without one's awareness.[101][102]\\r\\nThe American Astronomical Society (AAS) said products meeting the ISO 12312-2 standard avoid risk to one's eyes, and issued a list of reputable vendors of eclipse glasses. The organization warned against products claiming ISO certification or even citing the same number, but not tested by an accredited laboratory. Another problem was counterfeits of reputable vendors' products, some even claiming the company's name such as with American Paper Optics which published information detailing the differences between its glasses and counterfeits.[103][101]\\r\\nAndrew Lund, the owner of a company which produces eclipse glasses, noted that not all counterfeit glasses were necessarily unsafe. He stated to Quartz that the counterfeits he tested blocked the majority of harmful light spectrum, concluding that \\"the IP is getting ripped off, but the good news is there are no long-term harmful effects.\\"[100] As one example, the Springdale Library in metropolitan Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, accidentally passed out dozens of pairs of counterfeit eclipse glasses, but as of August 23 had not received any reports of eye damage.[104]\\r\\nOn July 27, 2017, Amazon required all eclipse viewing products sold on its website have a submission of origin and safety information, and proof of an accredited ISO certification. In mid-August 2017, Amazon recalled and pulled listings for eclipse viewing glasses that \\"may not comply with industry standards\\", and gave refunds to customers who had purchased them.[105][10]\\r\\nShort-term damage includes solar keratitis, which is similar to sunburn of the cornea. Symptoms usually occur within twenty-four hours and include eye pain and light sensitivity.[106]\\r\\nLong-term or permanent damage includes solar retinopathy, which occurs when the sun burns a hole in the retina, usually at the fovea (the focus of the retina). Symptoms can occur as long as several weeks after the incident, and can include loss of central vision and/or other vision, as well as eye pain and light sensitivity, afterimages, and changes in color vision.[107]\\r\\nDepending on the severity of damage, vision problems can last for several months or be permanent.[106]\\r\\nDr. Avnish Deobhakta, an ophthalmologist in New York, states that, \\"If youre looking at the sun youre actually focusing, intentionally, the light of the sun onto the spot [fovea] where you want the most precise vision.[108]\\r\\nFollowing a total eclipse in the United Kingdom in 1999, at least 14 cases of permanent damage were confirmed.[109]\\r\\nOne story of solar eclipse danger was illustrated by the case of Mr. Tomososki, who damaged his eyesight when viewing a 1962 eclipse, leaving him with a pea-sized blind spot for the rest of his life.[110] During the 2017 eclipse he warned the country to not make the mistake he did.[110] While some can recover, the danger of an eclipse comes in part because the excitement can override the instinct to not look at the sun.[111]\\r\\nOfficials inside and near the path of totality planned?ÿ sometimes for years?ÿ for the sudden influx of people.[112] Smaller towns struggled to arrange viewing sites and logistics for what could have been a tourism boom or a disaster.[113]\\r\\nIn the American West, illegal camping was a major concern, including near cities like Jackson Hole, Wyoming.[9] Idaho's Office of Emergency Management said Idaho was a prime viewing state, and advised jurisdictions to prepare for service load increases; nearly every hotel and motel room, campground, and in some cases backyards for nearly 100 miles (160?km) north and south of the path of totality had been reserved several months, if not years, in advance.[114] The state anticipated up to 500,000 visitors to join its 1.6?million residents.[115]\\r\\nOregon deployed six National Guard aircraft and 150 soldiers because the influx of visitors coincided with the state's fire season.[116] Hospital staffing, and supplies of blood and antiÿsnake bite antidote, were augmented along the totality line.[117]\\r\\nIn Oregon, there were reports of hoteliers canceling existing reservations made at the regular market rate and increasing their rate, sometimes threefold or more, for guests staying to view the eclipse.[118] The Oregon Department of Justice (DOJ) investigated various complaints and reached settlements with affected customers of at least 10 hotels in the state.[119] These settlements included refunds to the customers and fines paid to the DOJ.[120]\\r\\nAlthough traffic to areas within the path of totality was somewhat spread out over the days prior to the eclipse,[121] there were widespread traffic problems across the United States after the event ended. Michael Zeiler, an eclipse cartographer, had estimated that between 1.85?million and 7.4?million people would travel to the path of the eclipse.[122]\\r\\nIn Oregon, an estimated one million people were expected to arrive that the Oregon National Guard was called in to help manage traffic in Madras along US 26 and US 97.[123] Madras Municipal Airport received more than 400 mostly personal planes that queued for hours while waiting to leave after the eclipse.[124]\\r\\nOfficials in Idaho, where the totality path crossed the center of the state, began planning for the eclipse a year in advance. The state Transportation Department suspended construction projects along Interstate 15, which traverses Eastern Idaho, from August 18ÿ22 in order to have all lanes open;[125] their counterparts in neighboring Utah, where many were expected to travel the 220 miles (350?km) north via the highway from the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, did the same. On the morning of the eclipse, many drivers left before dawn, creating traffic volume along I-15 normally not seen until morning rush hour; northbound traffic on the interstate in Box Elder County north of Salt Lake City slowed to 10ÿ15 miles per hour (16ÿ24?km/h).[126] The Idaho State Police (ISP) stationed a patrol car along I-15 every 15 miles (24?km) between Shelley and the Utah border.[127]\\r\\nAfter the eclipse, traffic more than doubled along I-15 southbound, with extensive traffic jams continuing for eight hours as viewers who had traveled north into the totality path from Utah returned there and to points south. The ISP tweeted a picture of bumper-to-bumper traffic stalled on the interstate just south of Idaho Falls. Motorists reported to local news outlets that it was taking them two hours to travel the 47 miles (76?km) from that city to Pocatello to the south, a journey that normally takes 45 minutes.[126] Others reported that it took three hours to travel from Idaho Falls to the closer city of Blackfoot, 30 miles (48?km) farther north of Pocatello.[128]\\r\\nIn the rest of the state the impact was less severe. Traffic nearly doubled on US 93, and was up 55 percent on US 20.[129]\\r\\nFor some northbound travelers on I-15, the Montana Department of Transportation had failed to make similar plans to those in Idaho, scheduling a road construction project to begin on August 21 that narrowed a section of the highway to a single northbound lane, near the exit to Clark Canyon Dam south of Dillon. Though that stretch of highway generally has a traffic count of less than 1,000 vehicles per day, on the day of the eclipse there were over a thousand vehicles per hour at peak times. As a result, traffic backed up as far as Lima, creating a delay of at least an hour for travelers heading northward. Further, as construction had not yet begun, drivers observed cones set up but no workers present on the road. While the state traditionally halts construction projects during high traffic periods, a state official admitted \\"we ... probably made a bad mistake here in this regard.\\"[121]\\r\\nIn Wyoming, estimates were that the population of the state, officially 585,000, may have doubled or even tripled, with traffic counts on August 21 showing 536,000 more cars than the five-year average for the third Monday in August; a 68 percent increase. One official offered an estimate of \\"two people in every car\\" to arrive at a one-million-visitor figure, and others noted that one million was a conservative estimate based on a one-day traffic count of limited portions of major highways. There were additional arrivals by aircraft, plus travelers who arrived early or stayed for additional days.[130] Two days before the eclipse, traffic increased 18 percent over a five-year average, with an additional 131,000 vehicles on the road.[131] Sunday saw an additional 217,000-vehicle increase.[130]\\r\\nFollowing the eclipse, more than 500,000 vehicles traveled Wyoming roads, creating large traffic jams, particularly on southbound and eastbound highways.[132] Drivers reported that it took up to 10 hours to travel 160 miles (260?km) into northern Colorado.[130] There was one traffic fatality,[133] and another fatality related to an off-highway ATV accident, but in general there were far fewer incidents and traffic citations than authorities had anticipated.[134]\\r\\nIn Tennessee, the Knoxville News Sentinel described the traffic problems created by the eclipse as the worst ever seen in that part of the state. One backup along Interstate 75 reached 34 miles (55?km) in length, between Niota and the Interstate 40 interchange at Farragut. A spokesman for the state's Department of Transportation allowed that the traffic jams were the worst he had seen in six and a half years on the job, noting that accidents had aggravated the already heavy traffic flows, attributed the I-75 congestion to Knoxville-area residents heading for the totality path at Sweetwater and returning during what was the city's normal afternoon rush hour.[135]\\r\\nBefore the eclipse, state officials had described their traffic expectations as equivalent to that generated by the Bonnaroo Music Festival, the twice-a-season NASCAR Monster Energy Cup races at Bristol or the formerly-held Boomsday fireworks festival. \\"Maybe they should have considered a tsunami of traffic combining all three of those heavily attended events\\", the News Sentinel commented. The Tennessee Highway Patrol made sure that \\"[e]very trooper not on sick leave or military leave or pre-approved leave [wa]s working\\" the day of the eclipse; the state DOT made sure its full complement of emergency-aid HELP trucks were available as well. Alert signs on the highways also warned motorists not to pull over onto the shoulders to watch the eclipse as it could increase the risk of dangerous accidents and block the path of emergency vehicles.[135]\\r\\nIn North Carolina, the Department of Transportation added cameras, message boards and safety patrols in the counties where the total eclipse would take place, as well as stopping road work. The department warned that due to \\"unprecedented\\" traffic ordinary activities requiring driving might prove difficult, and advised people to act as if there were snow.[136]\\r\\nAn eclipse causes a reduction of solar power generation where the Moon shadow covers any solar panel, as do clouds.\\r\\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corporation predicted minor impacts,[137] and attempted to measure the impact of the 2017 eclipse.[138] In California, solar power was projected to decrease by 4ÿ6,000 megawatts[139] at 70 MW/minute, and then ramp up by 90 MW/minute as the shadow passes. CAISO's typical ramp rate is 29 megawatts per minute.[140] Around 4 GW mainly in North Carolina and Georgia were expected to be 90 percent obscured.[139]\\r\\nAfter the 2017 eclipse, grid operators in California reported having lost 3,000ÿ3,500 megawatts of utility-scale solar power, which was made up for by hydropower and gas reliably and as expected,[141][142] mimicking the usual duck curve. Energy demand management was also used to mitigate the solar drop.[143]\\r\\nNV Energy prepared for the solar eclipse months in advance and collaborated with 17 western states. When the eclipse began covering California with partial darkness, which reduced its usual amount of solar-generated electricity, NV Energy sent power there. Likewise, when Nevada received less sunlight, other west coast states supplied electricity to it. During the solar eclipse, the state of Nevada lost about 450 megawatts of electricity, the amount used by about a quarter million typical residences.[144]\\r\\nThe 2015 eclipse caused manageable solar power decreases in Europe;[145] in Germany, solar power dropped from 14 GW to 7 GW, of a 38 GW solar power capacity.[146]\\r\\nOn June 20, 2017,[147] the United States Postal Service released the first application of thermochromic ink to postage stamps in its Total Eclipse of the Sun Forever stamp[148] to commemorate the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. When pressed with a finger, body heat turns the black circle in the center of the stamp into an image of the full moon. The stamp image is a photo of the solar eclipse of March 29, 2006 seen in Jalu, Libya.

Founded in 1916 in Rochester, Wegmans has appeared on Fortune's annual \\"100 Best Companies to Work For\\" list since the list first appeared in 1998, and has ranked among the top 10 for eight consecutive years.[7] In 2017, the company celebrated 20 years on the list, and has been ranked #2,[8] behind Google.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWegmans is a privately owned company, founded in 1916 by John and Walter Wegman as the Rochester Fruit and Vegetable Company.[10] Wegmans is headquartered in the Rochester suburb of Gates. Danny Wegman is the Chairman. His daughter, Colleen Wegman, is President and CEO; his other daughter, Nicole Wegman, is senior vice-president.[10] Danny's father, Robert Wegman, who died in 2006, was previously chairman. Robert was the son of co-founder Walter Wegman. During his life, Robert Wegman was a pioneer in the retail food business, as well as a generous donor to educational institutions and other charities.[11][12]\\r\\nIn 1968, the chain expanded beyond the Rochester area, with a store in Syracuse,[13] and again in 1977 with its first Buffalo store.[13] The first store outside New York opened in 1993 in Erie, Pennsylvania,[13] and the expansion continued into New Jersey in 1999,[13] Virginia in 2004, and Maryland in 2005.[13][14] As a part of the company's continued expansion efforts, Wegmans opened its fifth Maryland location in Columbia on June 17, 2012.[15] Its sixth Maryland location opened in Crofton on October 28, 2012, followed by a Germantown location on September 15, 2013.[16] Wegmans opened a store at the Montgomery Mall in North Wales, Pennsylvania, on November 3, 2013, the first store to be part of a shopping mall since the closing of the Midtown Plaza store in Rochester.[17][18]\\r\\nWegmans, having long planned to expand into New England,[19][20] opened their first store in that region in Northborough, Massachusetts, on October 16, 2011.[21][22] 2014 saw Wegmans opening two more Massachusetts stores, in Newton on April 27,[23] and in Burlington on October 26.[24] Its fourth Massachusetts store opened in Westwood on October 11, 2015.[25] The eighth Maryland store opened in Owings Mills, Maryland in September 2016.[26] In late 2016, Wegmans opened Virginia stores in Short Pump (August),[27] Midlothian,[27] and Charlottesville (November).[28] The Hanover Township, New Jersey location opened in July 2017. More locations are scheduled to open soon, including, Medford, Massachusetts, in fall 2017, Montvale, New Jersey, in fall 2017, Chantilly, Virginia, in 2018, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 2018,[29] and Natick, Massachusetts, in 2018. Nine other locations are currently in the works, including one in Brooklyn's Navy Yard, the chain's first location in New York City, Tysons Corner, Virginia, Harrison, New York in Westchester County, the first four North Carolina locations, which are in Cary, Chapel Hill, Raleigh, and West Cary, Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Washington, DC.[30][31][32][33][34][35]\\r\\nIn 2009, Wegmans ranked 29th on the Supermarket News list of the Top 75 North American Food Retailers based on sales volume,[36] up from number 32 on the 2007 Supermarket News list,[3] and 7th among privately held U.S. supermarkets.[citation needed] In 2009 Stores Magazine showed it to be the 74th-largest retailer in the United States with estimated revenues of $4.67 billion[37] As of 2006, it was the 66th largest privately held company, as determined by Forbes.[38] On Forbes's 2005 list, Wegmans ranked 54th.[39]\\r\\nMost of Wegmans' newer stores are of the \\"superstore\\" or \\"megamarket\\" type, with a large area, a variety of foods aimed at an upscale clientele, and in many stores, Market Caf in-store dining areas. From 2002-2009m Wegmans owned and operated Tastings, a full-service restaurant at its Pittsford, New York.[10] Tastings was replaced with The Food Bar, a 'seafood shack'-styled restaurant in the same space, and is now The Burger Bar, which serves hamburgers. Next Door by Wegmans, a stand-alone restaurant operated by Wegmans, opened across the street from the Pittsford store in 2009.\\r\\nIn January 2007, Wegmans announced two business ventures: (1) opening a 19,000?sq?ft (1,800?m2) liquor store in Pittsford (adding to its two existing wine centers, in Virginia and New Jersey); and (2) the creation of a $28 million \\"Culinary Innovation Center\\" (in Chili, New York), a corporate research and development facility that will house a new central kitchen (replacing some of the operations at its meat center).[40] The liquor store opened in April 2008 as Century Pittsford Wines. It is not owned by the company, but independently owned directly by a member of the Wegman family due to New York liquor laws. The store is 45,000?sq?ft (4,200?m2).[41][42] This business model has been replicated at three other New York Wegmans locations in Buffalo, DeWitt and Johnson City. Ownership of each liquor store is held by different members of the Wegman family due to New York State regulations prohibiting individuals from owning multiple liquor stores.[43]\\r\\nAfter Wegmans updated their logo to a script font, in November 2010, Walgreens filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Wegmans, claiming the \\"W\\" in the Wegman's logo is too similar to Walgreens'.[44] The lawsuit was settled in April 2011, with Wegmans agreeing to discontinue use of its \\"W\\" logo by June 2012, although the supermarket retains the right to use the \\"Wegmans\\" name in script.[45] According to Jo Natale, Wegmans director of media relations, \\"The cost of making relatively minor changes to a limited number of products was much less than the cost of litigating this case to the end.\\"[46]\\r\\nWegmans offers a pick-up service called \\"Personal Shopping\\" at selected locations.[47] In June 2017, Wegmans partnered with Instacart to provide home delivery service[48].

On October 4, 2005, Wegmans announced that it would close all Chase-Pitkin stores by early 2006[57] and focus on its supermarket operations. The decision to exit the home improvement business was reportedly due to the increasing dominance of national chains such as Lowe's and The Home Depot.[57] Chase-Pitkin stores closed individually at various points throughout March 2006.\\r\\nIn January 2008, Wegmans announced that it would no longer sell tobacco products because of their negative effects on human health and the environment[58] and would offer smoking cessation programs to all employees.[59] The decision drew praise from the American Lung Association of New York State, which presented Wegmans with the \\"Lung Champion Award\\".[59]\\r\\nWegmans began branding its products in 1979, offering basic commodities with a lower price than the national brands. The \\"Wegmans\\" brand has gradually expanded. In 1992, it began a line of health products, \\"Food You Feel Good About\\". The next sub-brand to be launched was \\"Italian Classics\\". In 1995, Wegmans introduced its imported pastas, canned tomatoes, and olive oils. Many of the products are from Italy. In 2002, Wegmans launched a line of organic products.\\r\\nWegmans stores offer a prepared foods section called \\"Chefs Creations\\". Here, prepared entrees ranging in price from $6 to $10 are paired with two side dishes of the customers choosing. These meals can also come pre-packaged by the store for easy selection. In 2016, Wegmans began pushing their \\"EZ Meals\\" line of ready-to-eat, ready-to-cook, and fresh-cut entrees and dinners. These products are created in-store with the benefit of offering an easy to prepare meal.\\r\\nThe Wegmans brand has been used extensively in the American sitcom The Office; the program is set in the city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, which does have a Wegmans store, despite being filmed in suburban Los Angeles.[60][61]","input":"Where was the first wegmans grocery store built?"},{"output":"around 1280 CE","context":"","input":"When did humans first settle in new zealand?"},{"output":"about 200 CE","context":"The Pyramid of the Sun is the largest building in Teotihuacan, believed to have been constructed about 200 CE,[6] and one of the largest in Mesoamerica. Found along the Avenue of the Dead, in between the Pyramid of the Moon and the Ciudadela, and in the shadow of the massive mountain Cerro Gordo, the pyramid is part of a large complex in the heart of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Pyramid of the Sun comes from the Aztecs, who visited the city of Teotihuacan centuries after it was abandoned; the name given to the pyramid by the Teotihuacanos is unknown. It was constructed in two phases. The first construction stage, around 100 CE, brought the pyramid to nearly the size it is today. The second round of construction resulted in its completed size of 224.942 meters (738 feet) across and 75 meters (246 feet) high,[clarification needed] making it the third largest pyramid in the world,[7] though still just over half the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza (146 metres). The second phase also saw the construction of an altar atop of the pyramid which has not survived into modern times. The Adosada platform was added to the pyramid in the early third century, at around the same time that the Ciudadela and the Temple of the Feathered Serpent were constructed.\\r\\nOver the structure the ancient Teotihuacanos finished their pyramid with lime plaster imported from surrounding areas, on which they painted brilliantly colored murals. While the pyramid has endured for centuries, the paint and plaster have not and are no longer visible. Jaguar heads and paws, stars, and snake rattles are among the few images associated with the pyramids.\\r\\nIt is thought that the pyramid venerated a deity within Teotihuacan society, however, little evidence exists to support this hypothesis. The destruction of the temple on top of the pyramid, by both deliberate and natural forces prior to the archaeological study of the site, has so far prevented identification of the pyramid with any particular deity.\\r\\nThe orientation of the structure may hold some anthropological significance. The pyramid is oriented slightly northwest of the horizon point of the setting sun on two days a year, August 12 and April 29, which are about one divinatory calendar year apart for the Teotihuacanos. The day of August 12 is significant because it would have marked the date of the beginning of the present era and the initial day of the Maya long-count calendar. In addition, many important astronomical events can be viewed from the location of the pyramid that are important in terms of both agriculture and belief systems of the ancient society.\\r\\nThe pyramid was built over a man-made tunnel leading to a \\"cave\\" located six metres down beneath the centre of the structure. Originally this was believed to be a naturally formed lava tube cave and interpreted as possibly the place of Chicomoztoc, the place of human origin according to Nahua legends. More recent excavations have suggested that the space is man-made and could have served as a royal tomb.[9] Recently scientists have used muon detectors to try to find other chambers within the interior of the pyramid[10], but substantial looting has prevented the discovery of a function for the chambers in Teotihuacan society.[citation needed]\\r\\nOnly a few caches of artifacts have been found in and around the pyramid. Obsidian arrowheads and human figurines have been discovered inside the pyramid and similar objects have been found at the nearby Pyramid of the Moon and Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent in the Ciudadela. These objects may have represented sacrificial victims. A unique historical artifact discovered near the foot of the pyramid at the end of the nineteenth century was the Teotihuacan Ocelot, which is now in the British Museum's collection.[11] In addition, burial sites of children have been found in excavations at the corners of the pyramid. It is believed that these burials were part of a sacrificial ritual dedicating the building of the pyramid.\\r\\nCoordinates: 194135N 985038W? / ?19.693N 98.844W? / 19.693; -98.844","input":"When was the pyramid of the sun built?"},{"output":"August 1, 1774","context":"The Virginia Conventions have been the assemblies of delegates elected for the purpose of establishing constitutions of fundamental law for the Commonwealth of Virginia superior to General Assembly legislation.

The Burgesses declared support for Massachusetts and called for a congress of all the colonies, the Continental Congress. The Burgesses, convened as the First Convention, met on August 1, 1774, and elected officers, banned commerce and payment of debts with Britain, and pledged supplies. They elected Peyton Randolph, the Speaker of the House of Burgesses, as the President of the Convention (a position he held for subsequent conventions until his death in October 1775).[2]\\r\\nThe Second Convention met in Richmond at St. John's Episcopal Church on March 20, 1775. Delegates again chose a presiding officer and they elected delegates to the Continental Congress. At the convention, Patrick Henry proposed arming the Virginia militia and delivered his \\"give me liberty or give me death\\" speech to rally support for the measure. It was resolved that the colony be \\"put into a posture of defence: and that Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee, Robert Carter Nicholas, Benjamin Harrison, Lemuel Riddick, George Washington, Adam Stephen, Andrew Lewis, William Christian, Edmund Pendleton, Thomas Jefferson and Isaac Zane, Esquires, be a committee to prepare a plan for the embodying arming and disciplining such a number of men as may be sufficient for that purpose.\\"[3]\\r\\nBetween conventions in April 1775, Randolph, who was both the Speaker of the House of Burgesses and President of the Virginia Conventions, negotiated with Lord Dunmore for gunpowder removed from the Williamsburg arsenal to a British warship during the Gunpowder Incident, which was a confrontation between the Governor's forces and Virginia militia, led by Patrick Henry. The House of Burgesses was called back by Lord Dunmore one last time in June 1775 to address British Prime Minister Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution. Randolph, who was a delegate to the Continental Congress, returned to Williamsburg to take his place as Speaker. Randolph indicated that the resolution had not been sent to the Congress (it had instead been sent to each colony individually in an attempt to divide them and bypass the Continental Congress). The House of Burgesses rejected the proposal, which was also later rejected by the Continental Congress.[4]\\r\\nThe Third Convention met on July 17, 1775, also at St. John's Church, after Lord Dunmore had fled the capital (following the rejection of North's resolution) and taken refuge on a British warship. Peyton Randolph continued to serve as the President of the Convention.[5] The convention created a Committee of Safety to govern as an executive body in the absence of the royal governor (Dunmore). Members of the committee were Edmund Pendleton, George Mason, John Page, Richard Bland, Thomas Ludwell Lee, Paul Carrington, Dudley Digges, William Cabell, Carter Braxton, James Mercer, and John Tabb.[6] The convention also divided Virginia into 16 military districts and resolved to raise regular regiments. The convention ended August 26, 1775, while the Committee of Safety would continue to meet and govern between Convention sessions.[7]\\r\\nThe Fourth Convention in Williamsburg met in December 1775 following November's declaration that the colony was in revolt by Lord Dunmore and fighting between his royal forces and militia forces in the Hampton Roads area.[8] Edmund Pendleton served as President of the Convention, succeeding Peyton Randolph who had died in October 1775. The Convention declared that Virginians were ready to defend themselves \\"against every species of despotism.\\" The convention passed another ordinance to raise additional troops.[9]\\r\\nBack in Britain, in December 1775, the King's Proclamation of Rebellion had declared the colonies outside his protection,[10] but throughout the first four Virginia Conventions, there was no adopted expression in favor of independence from the British Empire.[11]\\r\\nPeyton Randolph\\r\\n1774, 1775\\r\\nEdmund Pendleton\\r\\n1776, 1788\\r\\nPhilip P.

Virginia patriots had defeated an advancing British expeditionary force at the Battle of Great Bridge southeast of Norfolk in December.[12]\\r\\nThe newly elected Fifth Convention met in Williamsburg from May 6 to July 5, 1776. It elected Edmund Pendleton its presiding officer after his return as president of the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. There were three parties in the Fifth Convention. The first was mainly made up of wealthy planters, including Robert Carter Nicholas Sr.[13] The second party was made up of the more intellectual types. These included the older generation of George Mason, George Wythe, Edmund Pendleton, and the younger Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.[14] The third party was a minority of young men mainly from western Virginia. This party was led by Patrick Henry and included \\"radicals\\" who had supported independence earlier than 1775.[15]\\r\\nOn May 15, the Convention declared that the government of Virginia as \\"formerly exercised\\" by King George in Parliament was \\"totally dissolved\\".[16] The Convention adopted a set of three resolutions: one calling for a declaration of rights for Virginia, one calling for the establishment of a republican constitution, and a third calling for federal relations with whichever other colonies would have them and alliances with whichever foreign countries would have them. It also instructed its delegates to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia to declare independence.[17]\\r\\nOn June 7, Richard Henry Lee, one of Virginia's delegates to Congress, carried out the instructions to propose independence in the language the convention had commanded him to use: that \\"these colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states.\\" The resolution was followed in Congress by the adoption of the American Declaration of Independence, which reflected its ideas.[18]\\r\\nThe convention amended, and on June 12 adopted, George Mason's Declaration of Rights, a precursor to the United States Bill of Rights. On June 29, the convention approved the first Constitution of Virginia. The convention chose Patrick Henry as the first governor of the new Commonwealth of Virginia, and he was inaugurated on June 29, 1776. Thus, Virginia had a functioning republican constitution before July 4, 1776.[19]\\r\\nThe Constitutional Convention convened by the Articles of Confederation Congress in 1787 provided for a ratification process in the states that was duly transmitted by Congress to each state. As Virginians went to the polls to elect delegates to its state convention, six states had ratified including the two other largest states of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. But Virginia bisected the new nation from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River; its admission into the prospective union was critical if the United States as a nation-state were to have contiguous continental territory.[20]\\r\\nThe Convention met from June 2ÿ27, 1788, in the wooden \\"Old Capitol\\" building at Richmond VA, and elected Edmund Pendleton its presiding officer.[21] The Virginia Ratifying Convention narrowly approved joining the proposed United States under a constitution of supreme national law as authorized by \\"We, the people\\" of the United States. James Madison led those in favor, Patrick Henry, delegate to the First Continental Convention and Revolutionary wartime governor, led those opposed. Governor Edmund Randolph, who had refused to sign the U.S. Constitution, now chose to support adoption for the sake of national unity. George Mason who had refused to sign the U.S. Constitution due to the lack of a Bill of Rights continued in his opposition.[22] The Virginia ratification included a recommendation for a Bill of Rights, and Madison subsequently led the First Congress to send the Bill of Rights to the states for ratification.[23]\\r\\nPatrick Henry questioned the authority of the Philadelphia Convention to presume to speak for \\"We, the people\\" instead of \\"We, the states\\". In his view, delegates should have only recommended amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Edmund Randolph had changed from his opposition in the Philadelphia Convention to now supporting adoption for the sake of preserving the Union. He noted that the Confederation was \\"totally inadequate\\".[25] George Mason countered that a national, consolidated government would overburden Virginians with direct taxes in addition to state taxes, and that government of an extensive territory must necessarily destroy liberty.[26] Madison pointed out that the history of Confederations like that provided in the Articles of Confederation government were inadequate in the long run, both with the ancients and with the modern (1700s) Germans, Dutch and Swiss. They brought \\"anarchy and confusion\\", disharmony and foreign invasion. Efficient government can only come from direct operation on individuals, it can never flow from negotiations among a confederation's constituent states.[27]\\r\\nThe Virginia Ratification (Federal) Convention narrowly ratified the U.S. Constitution 89 to 79. Virginians reserved the right to withdraw from the new government as \\"the People of the United States\\", \\"whenever the powers granted unto it should be perverted to their injury or oppression,\\" but it also held that failings in the constitution should be remedied by amendment.[28] Unlike the Pennsylvania Convention where the Federalists railroaded the Anti-federalists in an all or nothing choice, in the Virginia Convention the Federalists made efforts to reconcile with the Anti-federalists by recommending amendments to the Federal Constitution like that of Virginia's Bill of Rights preamble to its 1776 Constitution.[29]\\r\\nAlmost immediately, the Constitution of 1776 was recognized as flawed both for its restriction of the suffrage by property requirements, and for its malapportionment favoring the smaller eastern counties. Between 1801 and 1813, petitioners called on the Assembly to initiate a constitutional convention ten times.[30] Malapportionment in the Assembly was seen by reformers as \\"an usurpation of the minority over the majority\\" by the slave-owning eastern aristocracy. Partisans argued for apportionment by white population, versus \\"federal numbers\\" combining white population with three-fifths slaves, versus the existing system counting whites and slaves equally to favor the slave-holding eastern counties.[31]\\r\\nThe Convention met from October 5, 1829 ÿ January 15, 1830, and elected Philip Pendleton Barbour its presiding officer. The last \\"gathering of giants\\"[32] from the Revolutionary generation included former presidents James Madison and James Monroe, and sitting Chief Justice John Marshall. But three generations were represented among those who would serve in public office including three presidents, seven U.S. senators, fifteen U.S. representatives and four governors. The other delegates to the convention were sitting judges or members of the Virginia General Assembly.[33]\\r\\nConservatives among the Old Republicans such as John Randolph of Roanoke feared any change from the Founders' 1776 Constitution would lead to an ideological anarchy of \\"wild abstractions\\" imposed by egalitarian \\"French Jacobins\\" through \\"this maggot of innovation\\". In answer, John Marshall advanced his view with a petition from the freeholders of Richmond which observed that, \\"Virtue, intelligence, are not among the products of the soil. Attachment to [slave] property, often a sordid sentiment, is not to be confounded with the sacred flame of patriots.\\" Any white male who had served in the War of 1812 or who would serve in the militia in their future defense of the country deserved the right to vote.[34]\\r\\nReformers' efforts to adopt direct popular election of the governor were defeated in favor of continuing election by the General Assembly.[35] Thomas Jefferson Randolph, Thomas Jefferson's grandson, proposed gradual emancipation, a suggestion which never made it out of committee onto the convention floor.[36] The reformers lost on almost every issue. Nevertheless, even with the exaggerated Virginia Senate representation apportioning the delegates, the three most important roll calls were close. The \\"white\\" population basis of apportioning the General Assembly failed by two votes. The extension of the vote to all free white males failed by two votes. When the popular election of governor passed on its first vote, it failed on reconsideration. The divisions which would lead to West Virginia's split were evident. Regardless of the various ideologies represented or delegate political affiliation, the final vote 55 for the proposed constitution to 40 against was along an east-west divide. Only one delegate voted yes from west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.[37]\\r\\nFollowing the 1830 Constitution, Virginia began to change politically under the pressure of party competition. Though the planter elite and their representatives in the ruling Democratic \\"Richmond Junto\\" continued to resist any change, western Democrats and Whigs were more inclined to a white population basis for apportionment in their determination to expand suffrage and to find a more equitable representation between east and west.[38]\\r\\nThe Convention delegates were a younger generation raised in the Second American Party System of Democrat Jefferson Davis and Whig Henry Clay. Unlike the three generation Convention of 1829ÿ30, the delegates were primarily in their twenties and thirties at the beginning of their careers in the professions and industry, without large land holdings, and without gentry family ties.[39]\\r\\nThe Convention met from October 14, 1850 ÿ August 1, 1851, and elected John Y. Mason its presiding officer. The Convention featured fierce debates; the arguments raged throughout Virginia in the press and they were widely reported nationally. Direct popular election of the governor was supported by Whig Congressman John Minor Botts. He was opposed by Richmond Junto Democrat Richard L.T. Beale who argued against the natural equality of all men, and the \\"plundering propensities\\" of the multitude seeking a \\"majority of mere numbers\\".[40] Although he was for direct election of the Governor, Henry A. Wise was more fearful of the eastern slave-holders' loss of control in the General Assembly. He believed that \\"protection of slavery, not the liberalizing of Virginia's Constitution, was the most significant business before the convention.\\"[41]\\r\\nAfter almost six months of wrangling, the question of apportionment was brought up for a vote. The compromise was to apportion the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. In the remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder would be limited to one term. Constitutional provision for public education was voted down.[42] Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.[43]\\r\\nAbraham Lincoln's constitutional election reflected the nations sectional divide, though 82 percent of the electorate had split among the Unionists, Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas and John Bell. Even before Lincolns inauguration, the Deep South states that had cast Electoral College votes for John C. Breckinridge resolved to secede from the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The Virginia Assembly called a special convention for the sole purpose of considering secession from the United States. Virginia was deeply divided, returning a convention of delegates amounting to about one-third for secession and two thirds Unionist. But the Unionists would prove to be further divided between those who would be labelled Conditional Unionists who would favor Virginia in the Union only if Lincoln made no move at coercion, and those who would later be called Unconditional Unionists who would be unwavering in their loyalty to the constitutional government of the United States.[44]\\r\\nThe Convention met from February 3 ÿ December 6, 1861, and elected John Janney its presiding officer. The majority at first voted to remain in the Union, but stayed in session awaiting events. At first, the speeches were mixed between Secessionists advocating leaving the Union, Conditional Unionists holding onto the patriotism of earlier times, and Unconditional Unionists insisting that secession was bad policy and unlawful.[45] On March 4, Abraham Lincolns inauguration day, Jefferson Davis called up 100,000 militia to serve a year and sent besieging troops to surround Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Fort Pickens in Florida. That same day Waitman T. Willey from trans-Alleghany Monongalia County answered secessionists with a Unionist speech. He defended Virginia's institutions from Northern attacks against slavery, but there is no constitutional right of secession?... He warned that secession would bring about war, taxes and the abolition of slavery in Virginia.[46]\\r\\nJohn S. Barbour Jr. of the Piedmonts Culpeper County was the first Unionist to break away into the secessionist camp. While resolutely protecting slave labor he was for encouraging manufacturing and commercial interests in Virginia against those of the North. He asked what would do more to promote Virginia's growth, participation in a hostile confederacy in which your [legislative] power will be but 11 out of 150 [with he North], or in a friendly confederacy where it will be 21 out of 89 [with the South]? In the South was a government to join \\"in full working order, strong, powerful and efficient ...\\" Henry A. Wise tried to move the Convention into a \\"Spontaneous Southern Rights Convention\\" to immediately install a secessionist government in Virginia, but on April 4, almost two-thirds of the Convention voted against secession, and a three-man delegation was sent to consult with Lincoln who had resolved to protect Federal property in the South.[47]\\r\\nWith the fall of Fort Sumter, Lincoln matched Jefferson Davis call up of 100,000 men for a year with a call for 75,000 for three months, including 3,500 Virginians to restore Federal property taken in the South by force.[48] But the Unionist bloc lost its Conditional Unionist faction with Lincoln's requisition of troops.[49] The next day, former Governor Henry Wise announced that he had set the \\"wheels of revolution\\" against the U.S. Government in motion with loyal Virginians seizing both the federal Harper's Ferry Armory and the Gosport Navy Yard at Norfolk. His exhortation resulted in a resolution to secede with a vote 88 for, 55 against.[50]\\r\\nThe Virginia Secession Ordinance was to repeal the ratification of the Constitution of the United States of America, by the State of Virginia.[51] Two days after the secession resolution and a month before the referendum, the Confederate flag was raised over Virginia's capitol building, a delegation was sent to vote in the Confederate Congress, state militias were activated and a Confederate army was invited to occupy Richmond. Though the ballots from Unionist counties were lost, the total referendum votes counted numbered more than that of the 1860 presidential election by including men voting viva voce aloud in Confederate army camps, approving secession by 128,884 to 32,134.[52]\\r\\nVirginia's second Convention of 1861 was a Unionist response to the secessionist movement in Virginia. The First Wheeling Convention meeting at Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), sat on May 13ÿ15. It called for elections to another meeting if Virginia's Ordinance of Secession were to pass referendum. After the vote was taken on May 23, the First Session of the Second Wheeling Convention met from June 11 June 25 to establish the Restored Government of Virginia, electing Arthur I. Boreman its presiding officer.[53] The Second Session of the Second Wheeling Convention met from August 6 to August 21 to call for a new state from the territory of Virginia to be named Kanawha.[54]\\r\\nThe Second Wheeling Convention included 32 western counties, Alexandria and Fairfax County.[55] Twenty-nine of the convention delegates were members of the Virginia General Assembly as state Delegates or state Senators, such as John J.Davis of Harrison County and Lewis Ruffner of Kanawha County.[56]\\r\\nJohn S. Carlile who had represented transmontane Harrison County as an Unconditional Unionist at the Richmond Secession Convention, was the floor leader at the Second Wheeling Convention who shepherded in the creation of the Restored Virginia Government. On June 14 he expanded on his view of state and federal relations, \\" the people of Virginia in establishing government for themselves deemed it best to create two agents. The Federal Government is one, and the State Government is the other?...\\" Referencing Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, Carlile observed, \\"Any act done or performed by the State agent in conflict with the powers conferred upon the Federal agent is to be null and void?... [the Constitution] provides for its own alteration, amendment or change?... But [the right of secession] was never intended?...\\"[57]\\r\\nOn June 17, Carlile attacked the rebellion as treason, he then accounted events at the Richmond Secession Convention in which he had been an Unconditional Unionist. \\"For several days before the Convention passed the Ordinance of Secession, it was absolutely besieged; members were threatened with being hung to the lamp posts; their lives were jeopardized; the mob was marching up and down the streets, and surrounding the Capitol, and everything was terror and dismay.\\"[58] Carlile continued to impeach the legitimacy of Virginia's referendum on secession.[59]\\r\\nRepublican Francis H. Pierpont of Marion County was elected by the Convention as Governor of the Restored Government of Virginia which was recognized by the Lincoln Administration. Unlike in Kentucky and Missouri, the Union armies were unable to reclaim most of the eastern Virginia counties for incorporation into the Restored Government by 1863, and West Virginia was made into its own state.[60]\\r\\nFollowing the creation of West Virginia, the remnant of Restored Virginian government held a Convention of delegates from a few periphery counties occupied by Union forces. The Convention met in Alexandria's U.S. District Court Room from February 13 ÿ April 11, 1864, and elected LeRoy G. Edwards, a slaveholder with three sons in the Confederacy as its presiding officer. The Convention sought direction from President Lincoln whether the General Government would sustain the civil authority, or \\"whether the civil is to become, as it is now, subordinate to the military\\", so that the convened delegates could support the Administration's war effort in the midst of Grant's Wilderness Campaign. Debate ensued over whether to seek to disenfranchise all supporters of the rebellion, but with an eye to governing after cessation of hostilities, it limited disenfranchisement only to those who had held office in rebel state or Confederate governments.[61]\\r\\nAfter debating whether abolition of slavery would best proceed gradually or at once, with compensation to loyal Union men or without, the Convention resolved to abolish slavery immediately without compensation on April 10, 1864. It abolished the viva voce voting and called for secret balloting for electing state officials. Immediately on its proclamation, the Constitution of 1864 was enforceable only in areas under Union control, but it would serve as Virginia's fundamental law until the Constitution of 1870 went into force.[62]\\r\\nA fifty-two-page journal of convention proceedings was published, but the debates were not formally recorded. W. J. Cowing, secretary of the convention and editor of the pro-Union Alexandria, Virginia State Journal, featured accounts of some debate, but only one edition of the Journal survives covering the convention.[63]\\r\\nDuring Congressional Reconstruction, U.S. General John Schofield administered Virginia as Military District One. After 1866, according to the Radical Reconstruction Acts, a rebelling state which had vacated its delegation in the U.S. Congress was required to incorporate the 14th Amendment into its state constitution before it was allowed to participate again.[64] By the time Schofield called a new state constitutional convention for 1868, three distinct parties had coalesced in Virginia. Radical Republicans, including most ex-slave freedmen, organized to advocate full political and social equality for blacks, but they wanted to exclude ex-Confederates from political participation either in government or at the ballot box. Moderate Unionists including many pre-war Whigs, sought political equality for blacks, but believed that ex-Confederates had to be included in the political community because of their majority in the white population. Conservatives wanted to ensure white control of the state without Radical influence on issues such as public education.[65]\\r\\nThe convention met from December 3, 1867 to April 17, 1868, at Richmond in the Capitol Building, and elected John C. Underwood its presiding officer. A convention of enfranchised Unionists, freedmen and ex-Confederates was dominated by Radical Republicans. The convention proposed two \\"obnoxious clauses\\" that provoked widespread opposition, meant to restrict suffrage among ex-Confederates. Negotiations with President Grant resulted in separating the two more controversial proposals, and the remaining constitution was ratified by referendum. It provided for the vote for African-Americans and public education.[66]\\r\\nThe convention concerned itself with federal-state relations, with the convention's Committee on the Preamble and Bill of Rights initially stating that, \\"\\"the General Government of the United States is paramount to that of an individual state, except as to rights guaranteed to each State by the Constitution of the United States.\\" But Jacob N. Liggett of Rockingham County voiced the ex-Confederate doctrine that \\"the Federal Government is the creature of the acts of the States.\\" Christopher Y. Thomas of Henry County proposed a compromise, to simply assert Article VI of the U.S. Constitution for Virginia's Bill of Rights, Section 2, that \\"the Constitution of the United States, and the laws of Congress passed in pursuance thereof, constitute the supreme law of the land, to which paramount allegiance and obedience are due from every citizen?...\\" That was not enough for the Radical majority. Linus M. Nickerson of Fairfax County who had served in a New York infantry regiment successfully added \\"this State shall ever remain a member of the United States of America?... and that all attempts from whatever source, or upon whatever pretext, to dissolve said Union?... are unauthorized, and ought to be resisted with the whole power of the State.\\"[67]\\r\\nRadicals in the convention, against the protests of General Schofield, were able to martial an uncompromised majority in their desire to disenfranchise the white ex-Confederate majority in the state. Instead of the moderate Republican position limiting voter restrictions to former U.S. officeholders who had supported rebellion, they sought to guarantee a future government of Union men only. The convention wrote two \\"obnoxious clauses\\" as they were widely known, that went beyond federal requirements to deny the vote to any office holder in rebel government and an \\"iron-clad oath\\" testifying that a prospective voter had never \\"voluntarily borne arms against the United States.\\"[68] Following the convention, General Schofield successfully negotiated with President Ulysses S. Grant to propose the referendum on the Radical \\"Underwood\\" Constitution, but separating its two disenfranchisement \\"obnoxious clauses\\", allowing voters to decide on them apart from the Constitution.[69] While the referendum on the main body of the Constitution was overwhelmingly approved, the two \\"obnoxious clauses\\" were defeated by a narrower margin.[70]\\r\\nAfter the end of Reconstruction in the 1870s, Virginia and other states of the former Confederacy restricted the suffrage by segregationist Jim Crow laws. By 1890 Southern states began to hold conventions that constitutionally removed large numbers of whites and most blacks from voter registration. Reformers among the Progressive Democrats seeking to expand the influence of the \\"better sort\\" of voters gained a majority by appealing to the electorate to overthrow the 1868 Underwood Constitution, which the Richmond Dispatch characterized as \\"that miserable apology to organic law which was forced upon Virginians by carpetbaggers, scalawags and Negroes supported by Federal bayonets\\".[71]\\r\\nIn May 1900, the increasing public dismay over the electoral fraud and corruption of the Democratic political machine under the control of U.S. Senator Thomas S. Martin manipulating poor white and black voters led to a narrow victory over his entrenched \\"court house crowd\\" in a referendum to call a constitutional convention.[72]\\r\\nThe convention met from June 12, 1901 to June 26, 1902, at Richmond in the Capitol Building and elected John Goode, Jr. its presiding officer, a former delegate to the 1861 Secessionist Convention. Progressives sought to reform corrupt political practices of the ruling Martin machine and to regulate railroads and big corporations. Martin delegates agreed to restrict suffrage of African-Americans and illiterate whites, and a State Corporation Commission was established.[73] When the railroads challenged the State Corporation Commission's constitutionality on the grounds it violated separation of powers, the commission was upheld in the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.[74]\\r\\nThe convention imposed a system of poll taxes along with literacy and understanding requirements to vote that had the effect of restricting the electorate. The outcome was almost immediate disenfranchising of blacks and half the previous number of whites voting.[75]\\r\\nFollowing the unlimited Convention of 1901ÿ02, twentieth century constitutional activity turned to a mixture of Governor-appointed constitutional commissions in 1927 and 1968, and limited constitutional conventions called by the General Assembly for very specific purpose. After the century's earliest convention disenfranchising voters in a constitution that was proclaimed, each modification of the Virginia Constitution has been sent to the voters for referendum approval. Virginia's women suffrage movement was unsuccessful until the national ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, and the General Assembly did not ratify until 1952, but women could vote beginning in 1920.[76]\\r\\nThe Commission met from July 7, 1926 ÿ February 16, 1927, and Virginia Chief Justice Robert R. Prentis was appointed its chair. Governor Harry F. Byrd, Sr., the successor boss of the Democratic Organization in Virginia, sought and gained governmental reform streamlining local government and increasing the power of the governor over the executive, as well as implementing constitutional restrictions on the General Assembly's ability to incur debt.[77]\\r\\nThe convention met on October 25, 1933, and adjourned that day. It elected C. OConnor Goolrick as its presiding officer. To answer Congressional legislation, it ratified the 21st Amendment repealing the 18th Amendment so as to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages. The 21st Amendment is the only amendment that required state convention ratification as of that time. The Amendment was ratified nationally by three-fourths of the states on December 5, 1933.[78]\\r\\nThe convention met from April 30 ÿ May 1, 2, 22, 1945, and elected John J. Wicker, Jr., its presiding officer. During World War II, Virginia held a constitutional convention called for the limited purpose of expanding the franchise to members of the armed forces during wartime. Efforts by some delegates to expand the scope of the convention to reduce the voting age below 21 failed.[79]\\r\\nThe convention met from March 5ÿ7, 1956, and elected John C. Parker its presiding officer. When the Supreme Court ruled segregated public schools unconstitutional, proponents of \\"massive resistance\\" to racial integration in schools secured a limited constitutional convention for the purpose of state financing of non-sectarian private schools, resulting in segregation academies supported by public funds.[80]\\r\\nThe Commission met from April 1968 ÿ January 1, 1969, and former Governor Albertis S. Harrison, Jr. was appointed its chair. After seven decades since the previous unlimited convention, a constitutional commission was called by Governor Mills E. Godwin, Jr. to consolidate piecemeal amendments and to conform with U.S. statutory and constitutional law, especially in the areas of education, voter rights and representation in Congressional and General Assembly districts.[81]\\r\\nAfter the Convention of 1901ÿ02, the General Assembly did not call another general convention in the twentieth century. Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s that might have been passed by the General Assembly and sent to the voters for ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the only state to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it is only one of two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.[82]\\r\\nSince 1971, additional piecemeal amendments have been added in response to federal developments. Amendments ratified by the voters reduced the voting age to eighteen to conform with the Twenty-sixth Amendment, removed residency requirements for voting, and conformed voter registration to the Motor Voter Act. A legislative session now may be called after a Governor's veto. Virginia joined thirty-two other states in 1996 by amending its Constitution to provide for rights of victims of crime. Since 1996 Virginia and other states have adopted a provision protecting the right of the people to hunt, fish and harvest game.[83]\\r\\nIn 2006, Virginians aligned with twenty-nine other states seeking to ban homosexual marriage by constitutional amendment. The amendment limited marriage to \\"unions between one man and one woman\\".[84] This Virginian constitutional provision ran afoul of the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment in both its due process and equal protections clauses in Obergefell v.

It spread to encompass much of Afghanistan,[9] present-day Pakistan and then the northern parts of India at least as far as Saketa and Sarnath near Varanasi (Benares), where inscriptions have been found dating to the era of the Kushan Emperor Kanishka the Great.[10] Kanishka was a great patron of Buddhism; however, as Kushans expanded southward toward the Indian subcontinent the deities of their later coinage came to reflect its new Hindu majority.[11][12]\\r\\nThe Kushans were one of five branches of the Yuezhi confederation,[13][14] a possibly Iranic[15][16] or Tocharian,[17][18][19][20][21][22] Indo-European[21][23][24][25] nomadic people who migrated from Gansu and settled in ancient Bactria.[14] The Kushans possibly used the Greek language initially for administrative purposes, but soon began to use Bactrian language.[3] Kanishka sent his armies north of the Karakoram mountains, capturing territories as far as Kashgar, Khotan and Yarkant, in the Tarim Basin of modern-day Xinjiang, China. A direct road from Gandhara to China remained under Kushan control for more than a century, encouraging travel across the Karakoram and facilitating the spread of Mahayana Buddhism to China.\\r\\nThe Kushan dynasty had diplomatic contacts with the Roman Empire, Sasanian Persia, the Aksumite Empire and Han Dynasty of China. While much philosophy, art, and science was created within its borders, the only textual record of the empire's history today comes from inscriptions and accounts in other languages, particularly Chinese.[26]\\r\\nThe Kushan empire fragmented into semi-independent kingdoms in the 3rd century AD, which fell to the Sasanians invading from the west, establishing the Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom in the areas of Sogdiana, Bactria and Gandhara. In the 4th century, the Guptas, an Indian dynasty also pressed from the east. The last of the Kushan and Kushano-Sasanian kingdoms were eventually overwhelmed by invaders from the north, known as the Kidarites, and then the Hepthalites.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese sources describe the Guishuang (ߑ), i.e. the Kushans, as one of the five aristocratic tribes of the Yuezhi, with some people claiming they were a loose confederation of Indo-European peoples,[27] though many scholars are still unconvinced that they originally spoke an Indo-European language. As the historian John E. Hill has put it: \\"For well over a century ... there have been many arguments about the ethnic and linguistic origins of the Great Yuezhi or Da Yuezhi (Έَ), Kushans (ߑ), and the Tochari, and still there is little consensus\\".[28]\\r\\nThe Yuezhi were described in the Records of the Great Historian }? and the Book of Han ?h?? as living in the grasslands of Gansu, in the northwest of modern-day China, until their King was beheaded by the Huns from Siberia (the Xiongnu H) who were also at war with China, which eventually forced them to migrate west in 176ÿ160?BCE.[29] The five tribes constituting the Yuezhi are known in Chinese history as Xim (), Gushung (ߑ), Shungm (юC), Xdn (Zު), and Dm ().\\r\\nThe Yuezhi reached the Hellenic kingdom of Greco-Bactria (in northern Afghanistan and Uzbekistan) around 135?BC. The displaced Greek dynasties resettled to the southeast in areas of the Hindu Kush and the Indus basin (in present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan), occupying the western part of the Indo-Greek Kingdom.\\r\\nSome traces remain of the presence of the Kushans in the area of Bactria and Sogdiana. Archaeological structures are known in Takht-I-Sangin, Surkh Kotal (a monumental temple), and in the palace of Khalchayan. Various sculptures and friezes are known, representing horse-riding archers,[30] and, significantly, men with artificially deformed skulls, such as the Kushan prince of Khalchayan[31] (a practice well attested in nomadic Central Asia). The Chinese first referred to these people as the Yuezhi and said they established the Kushan Empire, although the relationship between the Yuezhi and the Kushans is still unclear. On the ruins of ancient Hellenistic cities such as Ai-Khanoum, the Kushans are known to have built fortresses.\\r\\nThe earliest documented ruler, and the first one to proclaim himself as a Kushan ruler, was Heraios. He calls himself a \\"tyrant\\" in Greek on his coins, and also exhibits skull deformation. He may have been an ally of the Greeks, and he shared the same style of coinage. Heraios may have been the father of the first Kushan emperor Kujula Kadphises.\\r\\nBan Gu's Book of Han tells us the Kushans (Kuei-shuang) divided up Bactria in 128?BC. Fan Ye's Book of the Later Han \\"relates how the chief of the Kushans, Ch'iu-shiu-ch'ueh (the Kujula Kadphises of coins), founded by means of the submission of the other Yueh-chih clans the Kushan Empire, known to the Greeks and Romans under the name of Empire of the Indo-Scythians.\\"[32]\\r\\nThe Chinese Hou Hanshu ?h?? chronicles gives an account of the formation of the Kushan empire based on a report made by the Chinese general Ban Yong to the Chinese Emperor c. 125?AD:\\r\\nMore than a hundred years later [than the conquest of Bactria by the Da Yuezhi], the prince [xihou] of Guishuang (Badakhshan) established himself as king, and his dynasty was called that of the Guishuang (Kushan) King. He invaded Anxi (Indo-Parthia), and took the Gaofu (Kabul) region. He also defeated the whole of the kingdoms of Puda (Paktiya) and Jibin (Kapisha and Gandhara). Qiujiuque (Kujula Kadphises) was more than eighty years old when he died. His son, Yangaozhen [probably Vema Tahk (tu) or, possibly, his brother Sada?ka?a], became king in his place. He defeated Tianzhu [North-western India] and installed Generals to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang [Kushan] king, but the Han call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi.\\r\\nIn the 1st century BCE, the Guishuang (Ch: ߑ) gained prominence over the other Yuezhi tribes, and welded them into a tight confederation under yabgu (Commander) Kujula Kadphises. The name Guishuang was adopted in the West and modified into Kushan to designate the confederation, although the Chinese continued to call them Yuezhi.\\r\\nGradually wresting control of the area from the Scythian tribes, the Kushans expanded south into the region traditionally known as Gandhara (an area primarily in Pakistan's Pothowar and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region but going in an arc to include the Kabul valley and part of Qandahar in Afghanistan)[citation needed] and established twin capitals in Begram[35] and Peshawar, then known as Kapisa and Pushklavati respectively.\\r\\nThe Kushans adopted elements of the Hellenistic culture of Bactria. They adopted the Greek alphabet to suit their own language (with the additional development of the letter T \\"sh\\", as in \\"Kushan\\") and soon began minting coinage on the Greek model. On their coins they used Greek language legends combined with Pali legends (in the Kharoshthi script), until the first few years of the reign of Kanishka. After that date,[vague][when?][dubious ÿ discuss] they used Kushan language legends (in an adapted Greek script), combined with legends in Greek (Greek script) and legends in Prakrit (Kharoshthi script).\\r\\nThe Kushans \\"adopted many local beliefs and customs, including Zoroastrianism and the two rising religions in the region, the Greek cults and Buddhism\\".[36] From the time of Vima Takto, many Kushans started adopting aspects of Buddhist culture, and like the Egyptians, they absorbed the strong remnants of the Greek culture of the Hellenistic Kingdoms, becoming at least partly Hellenised. The great Kushan emperor Vima Kadphises may have embraced Saivism (a sect of Hinduism), as surmised by coins minted during the period. The following Kushan emperors represented a wide variety of faiths including Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and possibly Saivism.\\r\\nThe rule of the Kushans linked the seagoing trade of the Indian Ocean with the commerce of the Silk Road through the long-civilized Indus Valley. At the height of the dynasty, the Kushans loosely ruled a territory that extended to the Aral Sea through present-day Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into northern India.\\r\\nThe loose unity and comparative peace of such a vast expanse encouraged long-distance trade, brought Chinese silks to Rome, and created strings of flourishing urban centers.\\r\\nRosenfield notes that archaeological evidence of a Kushan rule of long duration is present in an area stretching from Surkh Kotal, Begram, the summer capital of the Kushans, Peshawar, the capital under Kanishka I, Taxila, and Mathura, the winter capital of the Kushans.[37]\\r\\nOther areas of probable rule include Khwarezm,[37] Kausambi (excavations of Allahabad University),[37] Sanchi and Sarnath (inscriptions with names and dates of Kushan kings),[37] Malwa and Maharashtra,[38] and Odisha (imitation of Kushan coins, and large Kushan hoards).[37]\\r\\nKushan invasions in the 1st century CE had been given as an explanation for the migration of Indians from the Indian Subcontinent toward Southeast Asia according to proponents of a Greater India theory by 20th-century Indian nationalists. However, there is no evidence to support this hypothesis.[39]\\r\\nThe recently discovered Rabatak inscription confirms the account of the Hou Hanshu, Weile, and inscriptions dated early in the Kanishka era (incept probably 127 CE), that large Kushan dominions expanded into the heartland of northern India in the early 2nd century CE. Lines 4 to 7 of the inscription[40] describe the cities which were under the rule of Kanishka, among which six names are identifiable: Ujjain, Kundina, Saketa, Kausambi, Pataliputra, and Champa (although the text is not clear whether Champa was a possession of Kanishka or just beyond it).[41][42][43] The Kushan state was bounded to the south by the Prata state of Balochistan, western Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan was known for the kushan Buddhist city of Merv.[37] As late as the 3rd century AD, decorated coins of Huvishka were dedicated at Bodh Gaya together with other gold offerings under the \\"Enlightenment Throne\\" of the Buddha, suggesting direct Kushan influence in the area during that period.[44]\\r\\nNorthward, in the 2nd century AD, the Kushans under Kanishka made various forays into the Tarim Basin, where they had various contacts with the Chinese. Both archaeological findings and literary evidence suggest Kushan rule, in Kashgar, Yarkand and Khotan.[45]\\r\\n...the prince [elavoor] of Guishuang, named thilac [Kujula Kadphises], attacked and exterminated the four other xihou. He established himself as king, and his dynasty was called that of the Guishuang [Kushan] King. He invaded Anxi [Indo-Parthia] and took the Gaofu [Kabul] region. He also defeated the whole of the kingdoms of Puda [Paktiya] and Jibin [Kapisha and Gandhara]. Qiujiuque [Kujula Kadphises] was more than eighty years old when he died.\\"\\r\\nThese conquests probably took place sometime between 45 and 60 and laid the basis for the Kushan Empire which was rapidly expanded by his descendants.\\r\\nKujula issued an extensive series of coins and fathered at least two sons, Sada?ka?a (who is known from only two inscriptions, especially the Rabatak inscription, and apparently never ruled), and seemingly Vima Takto.\\r\\nKujula Kadphises was the great-grandfather of Kanishka.\\r\\nVima Takto (Ancient Chinese: ?ԏ Yangaozhen) is mentioned in the Rabatak inscription (another son, Sadashkana, is mentioned in an inscription of Senavarman, the King of Odi). He was the predecessor of Vima Kadphises, and Kanishka I. He expanded the Kushan Empire into the northwest of South Asia. The Hou Hanshu says:\\r\\n\\"His son, Yangaozhen [probably Vema Tahk (tu) or, possibly, his brother Sada?ka?a], became king in his place. He defeated Tianzhu [North-western India] and installed Generals to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang [Kushan] king, but the Han call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi.\\"\\r\\nVima Kadphises (Kushan language: Ѯ ϫѴ򿼻?) was a Kushan emperor from around 90ÿ100 CE, the son of Sadashkana and the grandson of Kujula Kadphises, and the father of Kanishka I, as detailed by the Rabatak inscription.\\r\\nVima Kadphises added to the Kushan territory by his conquests in Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan. He issued an extensive series of coins and inscriptions. He issued gold coins in addition to the existing copper and silver coinage.\\r\\nThe rule of Kanishka the Great, fifth Kushan king, lasted for about 13 years from c.?127. Upon his accession, Kanishka ruled a huge territory (virtually all of northern India), south to Ujjain and Kundina and east beyond Pataliputra, according to the Rabatak inscription:\\r\\nIn the year one, it has been proclaimed unto India, unto the whole realm of the governing class, including Koonadeano (Kaundiny, Kundina) and the city of Ozeno (Ozene, Ujjain) and the city of Zageda (Saketa) and the city of Kozambo (Kausambi) and the city of Palabotro (Pataliputra) and so long unto (i.e., as far as) the city of Ziri-tambo (Sri-Champa).\\r\\nHis territory was administered from two capitals: Purushapura (now Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan) and Mathura, in northern India. He is also credited (along with Raja Dab) for building the massive, ancient Fort at Bathinda (Qila Mubarak), in the modern city of Bathinda, Indian Punjab.\\r\\nThe Kushans also had a summer capital in Bagram (then known as Kapisa), where the \\"Begram Treasure\\", comprising works of art from Greece to China, has been found. According to the Rabatak inscription, Kanishka was the son of Vima Kadphises, the grandson of Sadashkana, and the great-grandson of Kujula Kadphises. Kanishkas era is now generally accepted to have begun in 127 on the basis of Harry Falks ground-breaking research.[46][47] Kanishkas era was used as a calendar reference by the Kushans for about a century, until the decline of the Kushan realm.\\r\\nVsishka was a Kushan emperor who seems to have had a 20-year reign following Kanishka. His rule is recorded as far south as Sanchi (near Vidisa), where several inscriptions in his name have been found, dated to the year 22 (the Sanchi inscription of \\"Vaksushana\\" ÿ i.e., Vasishka Kushana) and year 28 (the Sanchi inscription of Vasaska ÿ i.e., Vasishka) of the Kanishka era.\\r\\nHuvishka (Kushan: Ѯ?, \\"Ooishki\\") was a Kushan emperor from about 20 years after the death of Kanishka (assumed on the best evidence available to be in 140) until the succession of Vasudeva I about thirty years later. His rule was a period of retrenchment and consolidation for the Empire. In particular he devoted time and effort early in his reign to the exertion of greater control over the city of Mathura.\\r\\nVasudeva I (Kushan: ϫѴ \\"Bazodeo\\", Chinese:  \\"Bodiao\\") was the last of the \\"Great Kushans.\\" Named inscriptions dating from year 64 to 98 of Kanishkas era suggest his reign extended from at least 191 to 225?AD. He was the last great Kushan emperor, and the end of his rule coincides with the invasion of the Sasanians as far as northwestern India, and the establishment of the Indo-Sasanians or Kushanshahs in what is nowadays Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwestern India from around 240?AD.\\r\\nThe Kushan religious pantheon is extremely varied, as revealed by their coins that were made in gold, silver, and copper. These coins contained more than thirty different gods, belonging mainly to their own Iranic, Greek, and Indo-Aryan worlds as well. Kushan coins had images of Kushan Kings, Buddha, and figures from the Indo-Aryan and Iranian pantheons.[48] Greek deities, with Greek names are represented on early coins. During Kanishka's reign, the language of the coinage changes to Bactrian (though it remained in Greek script for all kings). After Huvishka, only two divinities appear on the coins: Ardoxsho and Oesho (see details below).\\r\\nThe Iranic entities depicted on coinage include:\\r\\nRepresentation of entities from Greek mythology and Hellenistic syncretism are:\\r\\nThe Indic entities represented on coinage include:\\r\\nThe Kushans inherited the Greco-Buddhist traditions of the Indo-Greek Kingdom they replaced, and their patronage of Buddhist institutions allowed them to grow as a commercial power.[56] Between the mid-1st century and the mid-3rd century, Buddhism, patronized by the Kushans, extended to China and other Asian countries through the Silk Road.\\r\\nKanishka is renowned in Buddhist tradition for having convened a great Buddhist council in Kashmir. Along with his predecessors in the region, the Indo-Greek king Menander I (Milinda) and the Indian emperors Ashoka and Harsha Vardhana, Kanishka is considered by Buddhism as one of its greatest benefactors.\\r\\nDuring the 1st century AD, Buddhist books were being produced and carried by monks, and their trader patrons. Also, monasteries were being established along these land routes that went from China and other parts of Asia. With the development of Buddhist books, it caused a new written language called Gandhara. Gandhara consists of eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. Scholars are said to have found many Buddhist scrolls that contained the Gandhari language.[57]\\r\\nThe reign of Huvishka corresponds to the first known epigraphic evidence of the Buddha Amitabha, on the bottom part of a 2nd-century statue which has been found in Govindo-Nagar, and now at the Mathura Museum. The statue is dated to \\"the 28th year of the reign of Huvishka\\", and dedicated to \\"Amitabha Buddha\\" by a family of merchants. There is also some evidence that Huvishka himself was a follower of Mahyna Buddhism. A Sanskrit manuscript fragment in the Sch?yen Collection describes Huvishka as one who has \\"set forth in the Mahyna.\\"[58]\\r\\nThe art and culture of Gandhara, at the crossroads of the Kushan hegemony, continued the traditions of Greco-Buddhist art and are the best known expressions of Kushan influences to Westerners. Several direct depictions of Kushans are known from Gandhara, where they are represented with a tunic, belt and trousers and play the role of devotees to the Buddha, as well as the Bodhisattva and future Buddha Maitreya.\\r\\nDuring the Kushan Empire, many images of Gandhara share a strong resemblance to the features of Greek, Syrian, Persian and Indian figures. These Western-looking stylistic signatures often include heavy drapery and curly hair,[59] representing a composite (the Greeks, for example, often possessed curly hair).\\r\\nIn the iconography, they are never associated however with the very Hellenistic \\"Standing Buddha\\" statues, which might therefore correspond to an earlier historical period.\\r\\nSeveral Roman sources describe the visit of ambassadors from the Kings of Bactria and India during the 2nd century, probably referring to the Kushans.\\r\\nHistoria Augusta, speaking of Emperor Hadrian (117ÿ138) tells:\\r\\nReges Bactrianorum legatos ad eum, amicitiae petendae causa, supplices miserunt\\r\\n\\"The kings of the Bactrians sent supplicant ambassadors to him, to seek his friendship.\\"\\r\\nAlso in 138, according to Aurelius Victor (Epitome? XV, 4), and Appian (Praef., 7), Antoninus Pius, successor to Hadrian, received some Indian, Bactrian, and Hyrcanian ambassadors.\\r\\n\\"Precious things from Da Qin [the Roman Empire] can be found there [in Tianzhu or Northwestern India], as well as fine cotton cloths, fine wool carpets, perfumes of all sorts, sugar candy, pepper, ginger, and black salt.\\"\\r\\nThe summer capital of the Kushan Empire in Begram has yielded a considerable amount of goods imported from the Roman Empire--in particular, various types of glassware.\\r\\nDuring the 1st and 2nd century, the Kushan Empire expanded militarily to the north and occupied parts of the Tarim Basin, their original grounds, putting them at the center of the profitable Central Asian commerce with the Roman Empire. They are related to have collaborated militarily with the Chinese against nomadic incursion, particularly when they collaborated with the Han Dynasty general Ban Chao against the Sogdians in 84, when the latter were trying to support a revolt by the king of Kashgar.[61] Around 85, they also assisted the Chinese general in an attack on Turpan, east of the Tarim Basin.\\r\\nIn recognition for their support to the Chinese, the Kushans requested a Han princess, but were denied,[61][62] even after they had sent presents to the Chinese court. In retaliation, they marched on Ban Chao in 86 with a force of 70,000, but were defeated by a smaller Chinese force.[61][62] The Yuezhi retreated and paid tribute to the Chinese Empire during the reign of emperor He of Han (89ÿ106).\\r\\nLater, around 116, the Kushans under Kanishka established a kingdom centered on Kashgar, also taking control of Khotan and Yarkand, which were Chinese dependencies in the Tarim Basin, modern Xinjiang. They introduced the Brahmi script, the Indian Prakrit language for administration, and expanded the influence of Greco-Buddhist art which developed into Serindian art.\\r\\nThe Kushans are again recorded to have sent presents to the Chinese court in 158ÿ159 during the reign of emperor Huan of Han.\\r\\nFollowing these interactions, cultural exchanges further increased, and Kushan Buddhist missionaries, such as Lokaksema, became active in the Chinese capital cities of Loyang and sometimes Nanjing, where they particularly distinguished themselves by their translation work. They were the first recorded promoters of Hinayana and Mahayana scriptures in China, greatly contributing to the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism.\\r\\nAfter the death of Vasudeva I in 225, the Kushan empire split into western and eastern halves. The Western Kushans (in Afghanistan) were soon subjugated by the Persian Sasanian Empire and lost Sogdiana, Bactria and Gandhara to them. The Sasanians deposed the Western dynasty and replaced them with Persian vassals known as the Kushanshas (also called Indo-Sasanians or Kushano-Sasanians).\\r\\nThe Eastern Kushan kingdom was based in the Punjab. Around 270 their territories on the Gangetic plain became independent under local dynasties such as the Yaudheyas. Then in the mid-4th century they were subjugated by the Gupta Empire under Samudragupta.\\r\\nIn 360 a Kidarite Hun named Kidara overthrew the Indo-Sasanians and remnants of the old Kushan dynasty, and established the Kidarite Kingdom. The Kushan style of Kidarite coins indicates they claimed Kushan heritage.

Infectious body fluids include blood, sweat, semen, breast milk, saliva, tears, feces, urine, vaginal secretions, vomit, and diarrhea.[11]\\r\\nEven after a successful recovery from an Ebola infection, semen may contain the virus for at least two months.[12] Breast milk may contain the virus for two weeks after recovery, and transmission of the disease to a consumer of the breast milk may be possible.[13] By October 2014 it was suspected that handling a piece of contaminated paper may be enough to contract the disease.[14] Contamination on paper makes it harder to keep records in Ebola clinics, as data about patients written on paper that gets written down in a \\"hot\\" zone is hard to pass to a \\"safe\\" zone, because if there is any contamination it may bring Ebola into that area.[14]\\r\\nOne aspect of Sierra Leone that is alleged to have aided the disease, is the strong desire of many to have very involved funeral practices.[15] For example, for the Kissi people who inhabit part of Sierra Leone, it is important to bury the bodies of the dead near them.[15] Funeral practices include rubbing the corpses down with oil, dressing them in fine clothes, then having those at the funeral hug and kiss the dead body.[15] This may aid the transmission of Ebola, because those that die from Ebola disease are thought to have high concentrations of the virus in their body, even after they have died.[15]\\r\\nFor the 2001 outbreak of Sudan virus in Uganda, attending a funeral of an Ebola victim was rated by the CDC as one of the top three risk factors for contracting Ebola, along with contact with a family member with Ebola or providing medical care to someone with a case of Ebola virus disease.[16] The main start of the outbreak in Sierra Leone was linked to a single funeral in which the WHO estimates as many as 365 died from Ebola disease after getting the disease at the funeral.[17]\\r\\nBushmeat has also been implicated in spreading Ebola disease, either by handling the raw meat or through droppings from the animals.[18] It is the raw blood and meat that is thought to be more dangerous, so it is those that hunt and butcher the raw meat that are more at risk as opposed to cooked meat sold at market.[19] Health care workers in Sierra Leone have been warned not to go to markets.[20]\\r\\nIn late March 2014 there were suspected but not confirmed cases in Sierra Leone.[21] The government announced on 31 March 2014 that there were no cases in Sierra Leone.[22]\\r\\nThe epidemic is thought to have started in late May when 14 people returned from a funeral of a traditional healer, who had been trying to cure others with Ebola in Guinea.[3] The first person reported infected was a tribal healer. She had treated an infected person(s) and died on 26 May. According to tribal tradition, her body was washed for burial and this appears to have led to infections in women from neighboring towns.[23]\\r\\nThe corpses were highly contagious immediately after death, so precautions such as hazmat suits were needed.[24] In this region the practice of kissing and touching the dead was implicated in helping to spread Ebola.[25] However, two U.S. doctors who \\"followed all CDC and WHO protocols to the letter\\" still managed to contract the disease and it is not clear how they got the disease.[26]\\r\\nBy 27 May 2014 it was reported 5 people died from the Ebola virus and there were 16 new cases of the disease.[27][28] Between 27 May 2014 and 30 May the number of confirmed, probable, or suspected cases of Ebola went from 16 to 50.[29] By 9 June, the number of cases had risen to 42 known and 113 being tested, with a total of 16 known to have died from the disease by that time.[30]\\r\\nThe disease spread rapidly in the area, and the local government hospital was overwhelmed.[17] At that hospital 12 nurses died despite having the world's only Lassa fever isolation ward, according to the U.N.[17] The hospital proved instrumental early on, detecting the first case in the country and supporting the release of a research paper on Ebola.[31] However, the growing number of cases there led to infection and loss of Sierra Leone's hemorrhagic fever expert, Doctor Khan, and the normal functioning of the hospital was disrupted because of the danger of getting infected by the disease.[31]\\r\\nOn 12 June the country declared a state of emergency in the Kailahun District, where it announced the closure of schools, cinemas, and nightlife places; the district borders both Guinea and Liberia, and all vehicles would be subject to screening at checkpoints.[32][33] The government declared on 11 June that its country's borders would be closed to Guinea and Liberia; but many local people cross the borders on unofficial routes which were difficult for authorities to control.[34][35] Seasonal rains that fall between June and August interfered with the fight against Ebola, and in some cases caused flooding in Sierra Leone.[36]\\r\\nBy July 11, 2014 the first case was reported in the capital of Sierra Leone, Freetown, however the person had traveled to the capital from another area of the country.[37] By this time there were over 300 confirmed cases and 99 were confirmed to have died from Ebola.[37] There was another case before the end of the month.[38]\\r\\nOn 29 July, well-known physician Sheik Umar Khan, Sierra Leone's only expert on hemorrhagic fever, died after contracting Ebola at his clinic in Kenema. Khan had long worked with Lassa fever, a disease that kills over 5,000 a year in Africa. He had expanded his clinic to accept Ebola patients. Sierra Leone's President, Ernest Bai Koroma, celebrated Khan as a \\"national hero\\".[23] On 30 July, Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency and deployed troops to quarantine hot spots.[39]\\r\\nIn August, awareness campaigns in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital, were delivered over the radio and through loudspeakers.[40] Also in August, Sierra Leone passed a law that subjected anyone hiding someone believed to be infected to two years in jail. At the time the law was enacted, a top parliamentarian was critical of failures by neighboring countries to stop the outbreak.[41] Also in early August Sierra Leone cancelled league football (soccer) matches.[42]\\r\\nWithin 2 days of 12 September 2014, there were 20 lab-confirmed cases discovered in Freetown, Sierra Leone.[43] One issue was that residents were leaving dead bodies in the street.[43] By 6 September 2014 there were 60 cases of Ebola in Freetown, out of about 1100 nationwide at this time.[44] However, not everyone was bringing cases to doctors, and they were not always being treated.[44] One doctor said the Freetown health system was not functioning, and during this time, respected Freetown Doctor Olivette Buck fell ill and died from Ebola by 14 September 2014.[44][45] The population of Freetown in 2011 was 941,000.[46]\\r\\nBy 18 September 2014 teams of people that buried the dead were struggling to keep up, as 20ÿ30 bodies needed to be buried each day.[47] The teams drove on motor-bikes to collect samples from corpses to see if they died from Ebola.[47] Freetown, Sierra Leone had one laboratory that could do Ebola testing.[47]\\r\\nWHO estimated on 21 September that Sierra Leone's capacity to treat Ebola cases fell short by the equivalent of 532 beds.[48] Experts pushed for a greater response at this time noting that it could destroy Sierra Leone and Liberia.[49] At that time it was estimated that if it spread through both Liberia and Sierra Leone up to 5 million could be killed;[50] the population of Liberia is about 4.3 million and Sierra Leone is about 6.1 million.\\r\\nIn an attempt to control the disease, Sierra Leone imposed a three-day lockdown on its population from 19 to 21 September. During this period 28,500 trained community workers and volunteers went door-to-door providing information on how to prevent infection, as well as setting up community Ebola surveillance teams.[51] The campaign was called the Ouse to Ouse Tock in Krio language.[52] There was concern the 72-hour lock-down could backfire.[53]\\r\\nOn 22 September, Stephen Gaojia said that the three-day lock down had obtained its objective and would not be extended. Eighty percent of targeted households were reached in the operation. A total of around 150 new cases were uncovered, but the exact figures would only be known on the following Thursday as the health ministry was still awaiting reports from remote locations.[54] One incident during the lock-down was when a burial team was attacked.[55]\\r\\nOn 24 September, President Ernest Bai Koroma added three more districts under \\"isolation,\\" in an effort to contain the spread. The districts included Port Loko, Bombali, and Moyamba. In the capital, Freetown, all homes with identified cases would be quarantined. This brought the total areas under isolation to 5, including the outbreak \\"hot spots\\" Kenema and Kailahun which were already in isolation. Only deliveries and essential services would be allowed in and out. A sharp rise in cases in these areas was also noted by WHO.[56]\\r\\nAs of late September about 2 million people were in areas of restricted travel,[57] which included Kailahun, Kenema, Bombali, Tonkolili, and Port Loko Districts.[58] The number of cases seemed to be doubling every 20 days, which led to the estimate that by January 2015 the number of cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone could grow to 1.4 million.[59]\\r\\nOn 25 September there were 1940 cases and 587 deaths officially, however, many acknowledged under-reporting and there was an increasing number of cases in Freetown (the capital of Sierra Leone).[60]\\r\\nWHO estimated on 21 September that Sierra Leone's capacity to treat Ebola cases fell short by the equivalent of 532 beds.[48] There were reports that political interference and administrative incompetence had hindered the flow of medical supplies into the country.[61]\\r\\nBy 2 October 2014, it was estimated 5 people an hour were being infected with the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.[62] By this time it was estimated the number of infected had been doubling every 20 days.[63] On 4 October, Sierra Leone recorded 121 fatalities, the largest number in a single day.[64] On 8 October, Sierra Leone burial crews went on strike.[65] On 12 October, it was reported that the UK would begin providing military support to Sierra Leone in addition to a major UK civilian operation in support of the Government of Sierra Leone.[66]\\r\\nIn October it was noted hospitals were running out of supplies in Sierra Leone.[67] There were reports that political interference and administrative incompetence hindered the flow of medical supplies into the country.[61] In the week prior to 2 October there were 765 new cases, and Ebola was spreading rapidly.[68] At the start of October there were nearly 2200 laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola and over 600 had died from it.[69] The epidemic also had claimed the life of 4 doctors and at least 60 nurses by the end of September 2014.[70] Sierra Leone limited its reported deaths to laboratory confirmed cases in facilities, so the actual number of losses was known to be higher.[14]\\r\\nSierra Leone was considering making reduced care clinics, to stop those sick with Ebola from getting their families sick with the disease and to provide something in between home-care and the full-care clinics.[71] These \\"isolation centers\\" would provide an alternative to the overwhelmed clinics.[71] The problem the country was facing was 726 new Ebola cases but less than 330 beds available.[72]\\r\\nMore than 160 additional medical personnel from Cuba arrived in early October, building on about 60 that had been there since September.[citation needed] At that time there were about 327 beds for patients in Sierra Leone.[73] Canada announced it was sending a 2nd mobile lab and more staff to Sierra Leone on 4 October 2014.[74]\\r\\nThere were reports of drunken grave-diggers making graves for Ebola patients too shallow, and as a result wildlife came and dug up and ate at the corpses.[75] In addition, in some cases bodies were not buried for days, because no one came to collect them.[76] One problem was that it was hard to care for local health care workers, and there was not enough money to evacuate them.[77] Meanwhile, other diseases like malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea were not being treated properly because the health system was trying to deal with Ebola patients.[78] On 7 October 2014 Canada sent a C-130 loaded with 128,000 face shields to Freetown.[79]\\r\\nIn early October 2014, a burial team leader said there were piles of corpses south of Freetown.[80] On October 9 the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated on Sierra Leone's behalf, the first time that its charitably repurposed satellite imaging assets had been deployed in an epidemiological role.[81][82] On 14 October 2014, 800 Sierra Leone peacekeepers due to relieve a contingent deployed in Somalia, were placed under quarantine when one of the soldiers tested positive for Ebola.[83]\\r\\nThe last district in Sierra Leone untouched by the Ebola virus declared Ebola cases. According to Abdul Sesay, a local health official, 15 suspected deaths with 2 confirmed cases of the deadly disease were reported on 16 October in the village of Fakonya. The village is 60 miles from the town of Kabala in the center of the mountainous region of the Koinadugu district. This was the last district free from the virus in Sierra Leone. All of the districts in this country had then confirmed cases of Ebola.[84]\\r\\nIn late October 2014, the United Kingdom sent one of their hospital ships, the Royal Navy's Argus, to help Sierra Leone.[85] By late October Sierra Leone was experiencing more than twenty deaths a day from Ebola.[86] In October 2014, officials reported that very few pregnant women were surviving Ebola disease.[87] In previous outbreaks pregnant women were noted to have a higher rate of death with Ebola.[88]\\r\\nOfficials struggled to maintain order in one town after a medical team trying to take a blood sample from a corpse were blocked by an angry machete-wielding mob. They allegedly believed the person had died from high-blood pressure and did not want the body being tested for Ebola. When security forces tried to defend the medical team, a riot ensued leaving two dead. The town was placed on a 24-hour curfew and authorities tried to calm the situation down.[89] Despite this several buildings were attacked.[90]\\r\\nOn 30 October the ship Argus arrived in Sierra Leone.[91] It carried 32 off-road vehicles to support Ebola treatment units.[92] The ship also carried three transport helicopters to support operations against the epidemic.[93] By the end of October 2014 there were over 5200 laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease in Sierra Leone.[94]\\r\\nOn 31 October 2014 an ambulance driver in Bo District died of Ebola. His ambulance picked up Ebola patients (or suspected Ebola cases) and took them to treatment centers.[96]\\r\\nOn 1 November, the United Kingdom announced plans to build three more Ebola laboratories in Sierra Leone. The labs helped to determine if a patient had been infected by the Ebola virus. At that time, it took as much as five days to test a sample because of the volume of samples that needed to be tested.[97]\\r\\nOn 2 November, a person with Ebola employed by the United Nations was evacuated from Sierra Leone to France for treatment. On 4 November, it was reported that thousands violated quarantine in search for food, in the town of Kenema.[98] On 6 November, it was reported that the situation was \\"getting worse\\" due to \\"intense transmission\\" in Freetown as a contributing factor; the capital city reported 115 cases in the previous week alone. Food shortages and aggressive quarantines were reported to be making the situation worse, according to the Disaster Emergency Committee.[99] Sierra Leone established call centers in Port Loko and Kambia, according to MSSL Communications as reported on November 21;[100] this was in addition to the June hotline originally established.[101]\\r\\nOn 12 November, more than 400 health workers went on strike over salary issues at one of the few Ebola treatment centers in the country.[102] On 18 November, the supply ship Karel Doorman of the Royal Netherlands Navy (Koninklijke Marine) arrived in Freetown, with supplies. Its Captain-Commander, Peter van den Berg, took steps to reduce the chance of the crew contracting Ebola virus disease.[103]\\r\\nThe Neini Chiefdom in Koinadugu District was subject to isolation after Ebola cases.[104] On 19 November, it was reported that the Ebola virus was spreading intensely; \\"much of this was driven by intense transmission in the country's west and north,\\" the WHO said.[105]\\r\\nA British-built Ebola Treatment Centre which started in Kerry Town during November generated some controversy because of its initially limited capacity. However, this was because they were following guidelines of how to safely open an Ebola treatment unit. This was the first of six planned treatment centres which, when completed, would be staffed by a number of NGOs.[106]\\r\\nIn mid-November the WHO reported that while all cases and deaths continued to be under-reported, \\"there is some evidence that case incidence is no longer increasing nationally in Guinea and Liberia, but steep increases persist in Sierra Leone\\".[107] On 19 November, it was reported that the Ebola virus was spreading intensely; \\"much of this was driven by intense transmission in the country's west and north\\", the WHO said.[105] The first Cuban doctor to be infected with the virus was flown to Geneva.[108] On 26 November, it was reported that due to Sierra Leone's increased Ebola transmission, the country would surpass Liberia in the total cases count.[109] On 27 November, Canada announced it would deploy military health staff to the infected region.[110] On 29 November, the President of Sierra Leone canceled a planned three-day shutdown in Freetown to curb the virus.[111]\\r\\nOn 2 December, it was reported that the Tonkolili district had begun a two-week lockdown, \\"which was agreed in a key stakeholders meeting of cabinet ministers, parliamentarians and paramount chiefs of the district as part of efforts to stem the spread of the disease,\\" according to a ministry spokesman. The move meant that a total of six districts, containing more than half of the population, were locked down.[citation needed]\\r\\nSierra Leone indicated, in a report on 5 December, that about 100 cases of the virus were now being reported daily.[112] On the same day, it was further reported that families caught taking part in burial washing rituals, which can spread the virus, would be taken to jail.[113] On 6 December, a report indicated that the Canadian Armed Forces would send a medical team to the country of Sierra Leone to help combat the Ebola virus epidemic.[114]\\r\\nOn 8 December, the doctors in Sierra Leone went on strike, demanding better treatment for health care workers, according to Health Ministry spokesman Jonathan Abass Kamara.[115]\\r\\nOn 9 December, Sierra Leone authorities placed the Eastern Kono District in a two-week lock-down following the alarming rate of infection and deaths there. The lock down lasted until 23 December.[116] This followed the grim discovery of bodies piling up in the district. The WHO reported fear of a major breakout in the area. The district with 350,000 inhabitants buried 87 bodies in 11 days, with 25 patients dying in 5 days before the WHO arrived.[117]\\r\\nOn 12 December, Sierra Leone banned all public festivities for Christmas or New Year, because of the outbreak.[118] On 13 December, it was reported that the first Australian facility had been opened; \\"operations will be gradually scaled up to full capacity at 100 beds under strict guidelines to ensure infection control procedures are working effectively and trained staff?... are in place\\", one source indicated.[119]\\r\\nMdecins Sans Frontires/Doctors Without Borders, in partnership with the Ministry of Health, carried out during December the largest-ever distribution of antimalarials in Sierra Leone. Teams distributed 1.5 million antimalarial treatments in Freetown and surrounding districts with the aim of protecting people from malaria during the disease's peak season. A spokesman said \\"In the context of Ebola, malaria is a major concern, because people who are sick with malaria have the same symptoms as people sick with Ebola. As a result, most people turn up at Ebola treatment centres thinking that they have Ebola, when actually they have malaria. It's a huge load on the system, as well as being a huge stress on patients and their families.\\"[120]\\r\\nBetween 14 December and 17 December Sierra Leone reported 403 new cases with a total of 8,759 cases on the latter date.[121][122] On 25 December, Sierra Leone put the north area of the country on lockdown.[123] By the end of December Sierra Leone again reported a surge in numbers, with 9,446 cases reported.[124][125]\\r\\nOn 29 December 2014, Pauline Cafferkey, a British aid worker who had just returned to Glasgow from working at the treatment centre in Kerry Town, was diagnosed with Ebola at Glasgow's Gartnavel General Hospital.[126][127]\\r\\nOn January 4, the lockdown was extended for two weeks.[128] On this day the country reported 9780 cases with 2943 deaths. Among healthcare workers there were 296 cases with 221 fatalities reported.[129]\\r\\nOn 8 January MSF admitted its first patients to a Treatment Centre (ETC) in Kissy, an Ebola hotspot on the outskirts of Freetown. Once the ETC is fully operational it will include specialist facilities for pregnant women.[130] By 9 January the case load in the country exceeded 10,000, with 10,074 cases and 3,029 deaths reported.[131] On 9 January, it was reported that South Korea would send a medical team to Goderich.[132]\\r\\nOn 10 January Sierra Leone declared its first Ebola-free district. The Pujehun district in the south east of the country reported no new cases for 42 days.[133]\\r\\nA worker at Kerry Town clinic was evacuated to the United Kingdom on February 2, 2015, after a needlestick injury.[134] On 5 February, it was reported that there was a rise in weekly cases for the first time this year.[135][136] The U.N. indicated that the sharp drop in cases had \\"flattened out\\" raising concern about the virus.[137]\\r\\nOn 5 March, a report indicated cases in Sierra Leone continued to rise.[138] The government of Sierra Leone declared a three-day country-wide lock-down including 2.5 million people on 18 March.[139][140] The U.N. indicates the outbreak will be over by August of this year.[141]\\r\\nThe 3-day lock-down of over 6 million inhabitants revealed a 191% increase in possible Ebola cases. In Freetown alone 173 patients meeting the criteria for Ebola were discovered according to Obi Sesay from the National Ebola Response Center.[142]\\r\\nAs of 12 May, Sierra Leone had gone 8 days without an Ebola case, and was down to two confirmed cases of Ebola.[143] The WHO weekly update for 29 July reported a total of only three new cases, the lowest total in more than a year.[144] On 17 August, the country had its first week with no new cases,[145] and one week later the last patients were released.[146]\\r\\nA new death was reported on 1 September after a patient from Sella Kafta village in Kambia District was tested positive for the disease after her death.[147] On 5 September another case of Ebola was identified in the village among the approximately 1000 people currently under quarantine. A woman tested positive for the virus. The \\"Guinea ring vaccine\\" has been administered by a WHO team in the village since Friday 5 September.[148] On 8 September the head of the National Ebola Response Center confirmed new cases of Ebola. This brought the total from the village to four cases, with all of them being under the \\"high risk\\" contact cases with the death of the new index case in the village. In total four cases were then confirmed including the dead woman.[149]\\r\\nOn 14 September, the National Ebola Response Center confirmed the death of a 16-year-old in a village in the Bombali district. Swabs taken from the body tested positive for the disease. The village was placed under quarantine.[150] She had no history of traveling outside the village, and it is suspected that she contracted the disease from the semen of an Ebola survivor who was discharged in March 2015. Seven of her immediate contacts were taken to an Ebola treatment center, with a further three patients she had contact with at a health clinic.[151] A new study to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates the possibility that the virus may lurk in the semen of survivors for up to six months. Nearly half of 200 patients tested had traces of the virus in their semen six months after surviving the disease.[152] On 7 November, the World Health Organization declared Sierra Leone Ebola-free.[citation needed]\\r\\nSierra Leone entered a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance which was scheduled to conclude on 5 February 2016, but due to a new case in mid-January it did not.[153] On 14 January, it was reported there had been a fatality linked to the Ebola virus. The case occurred in the Tonkolili district.[154] Prior to this case WHO had advised, \\"we anticipate more flare-ups and must be prepared for them?... massive effort is underway to ensure robust prevention, surveillance and response capacity across all three countries by the end of March.\\"[155] On 16 January, it was reported that the woman who died of the virus may have exposed several individuals; the government announced that 100 people had been quarantined.[156] On the same day, WHO released a statement, indicating that originally the 90-day enhanced surveillance period was to end on 5 February. Investigations indicate the female case was a student at Lunsar in Port Loko district, who had gone to Kambia district on December the 28th until returning symptomatic. Bombali district was visited by the individual, for consultation with an herbalist, later going to a government hospital in Magburaka. WHO indicates there are 109 contacts, 28 of which are high risk, furthermore, there are three missing contacts.The source or route of transmission which caused the fatality is still unknown.[157] A second new case was confirmed on 20 January; the patient had contact with the previous fatality.[158] On 17 March, the WHO declared the country Ebola-free.[159]\\r\\nLong-term political factors contributed to the Ebola crisis including the acute dependency on external health assistance, patron-client politics, corruption and a weak state capacity.[160] Prior to the Ebola epidemic Sierra Leone had about 136 doctors and 1,017 nurses/midwives for a population of about 6 million people.[161] On 26 August, the WHO shut down one of two laboratories after a health worker became infected. The laboratory was situated in the Kailahun district, one of the worst-affected areas. It was thought by some that this move would disrupt efforts to increase the global response to the outbreak of the disease in the district.[162]\\r\\n\\"It's a temporary measure to take care of the welfare of our remaining workers,\\" WHO spokesperson Christy Feig announced. He did not specify how long the closure would last, but said they would return after an assessment of the situation by the WHO. The medical worker, one of the first WHO staff infected by the Ebola Virus, was treated at a hospital in Kenema and then evacuated to Germany.[162][163] By 4 October 2014, it was announced he has recovered and left Germany.[164]\\r\\nAs the Ebola epidemic grew it damaged the health care infrastructure, leading to increased deaths from other health issues including malaria, diarrhoea, and pneumonia because they were not being treated.[165] The WHO estimated on 21 September that Sierra Leone's capacity to treat Ebola cases fell short by the equivalent of 532 beds.[48]\\r\\nOn 27 August 2014 Dr. Sahr Rogers died from Ebola after contracting it working in Kenema.[167] Sierra Leone lost three of its top doctors by the end of August to Ebola.[168]\\r\\nA fourth doctor, Dr. Olivette Buck, became ill with Ebola in September and died later that month.[169] Dr. Olivette Buck was a Sierra Leone doctor who worked in Freetown, who tested positive for Ebola on 9 September 2014 and died on 14 September 2014.[45] Her staff believes she was exposed in August. She eventually went to Lumley Hospital on 1 September 2014 with a fever, thinking it was malaria.[45] After a few more days of illness she was admitted to Connaught Hospital.[45]\\r\\nBy 23 September 2014, out of 91 health workers known to have been infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone, approximately 61 had died.[170]\\r\\nOn 19 October the WHO reported 129 cases with 95 deaths of healthcare workers (125 / 91 confirmed).[171] On 2 November 2014, a fifth doctor, Dr. Godfrey George, a medical superintendent of Kambia Government Hospital died as a result of Ebola infection.[172] On 17 November 2014, a sixth doctor, Dr Martin Salia, died as a result of Ebola infection, after being transported by medevac to Nebraska Medical Center in the United States.[173]\\r\\nOn 18 November 2014 a seventh doctor, Dr Michael Kargbo, died in Sierra Leone. He worked at the Magburaka Government Hospital.[174]\\r\\nDr. Aiah Solomon Konoyeima was reported to have Ebola in late November 2014, which would make him the eighth physician to contract Ebola.[175] He was reported to have died from the disease on December 7, 2014, becoming what was reported as the tenth doctor to die from Ebola.[176]\\r\\nOn 26 November 2014 a ninth doctor, Dr. Songo Mbriwa, was reported to be sick with Ebola disease.[177] He was working at an Ebola treatment centre in Freetown.[177] He was one of the doctors that cared for the late Dr Martin Salia, who experienced a false-negative Ebola test, but did indeed have it and may have exposed others.[178]\\r\\nOn Friday 5 December a senior health official announced the death of two of the country's doctors in one day. This brings the total number of doctors who have succumbed to the disease in Sierra Leone to ten. Dr Dauda Koroma and Dr Thomas Rogers are the latest deaths among healthcare workers.[179] The two doctors were not in the front line of the Ebola battle and did not work in an Ebola treatment hospital.[180]\\r\\nOn 18 December Dr. Victor Willoughby died from the disease after being tested positive for the disease on Saturday 6 December. The doctor died hours before he was to receive ZMAb, an experimental treatment from Canada, according to Dr. Brima Kargbo the country's chief medical officer. Dr. Victor Willoughby is the 11th doctor, and a top physician, to succumb to the disease.[181]\\r\\nSince the beginning of the outbreak in Sierra Leone in late May 2014, several people have been evacuated. An increasing lack of hospital beds, medical equipment, and health care personnel made treatment difficult.[citation needed]On 24 August William Pooley, a British nurse, was evacuated from Sierra Leone. He was released on September 3, 2014.[182][183] In October 2014 he announced he would return to Sierra Leone.[184]\\r\\nOn 21 September 2014 Spain evacuated a Catholic priest who had contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone with Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios.[185] He died on the 25th September in Madrid.[186] On 6 October 2014 a nurse who treated the priest tested positive for Ebola.[187] By 20 October 2014 the nurse seemed to have recovered after many days battling the disease in the hospital, with tests coming back negative.[188]\\r\\nA doctor from Senegal contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone for the WHO, and was evacuated to Germany at the end of August 2014.[189] By 4 October 2014, it was announced he has recovered and returned to Senegal.[164]\\r\\nIn late September, a doctor working for an International Aid organization in Sierra Leone, was evacuated to Switzerland after potentially being exposed. He later tested negative for the disease.[190]\\r\\nIn late September 2014, an American doctor working in Sierra Leone was evacuated to Maryland, USA, after being exposed to Ebola.[191] \\"Just because someone is exposed to the deadly virus, it doesnt necessarily mean they are infected\\", said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH.[191] He was evacuated after a needle sticking accident and even developed a fever, but he was determined not to have Ebola and was released the first week in October 2014. After being discharged he remained at home under medical observation, checking his temperature twice a day for 21 days.[192]\\r\\nIn early October, a Ugandan doctor who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone was evacuated for treatment to Frankfurt, Germany.[193] The doctor was working at Lakaa Hospital and flown out from Lungi Airport.[194]\\r\\nOn 6 October 2014, a female Norwegian MSF worker tested positive for Ebola virus and was subsequently evacuated to Norway.[195] Norwegian authorities reported that they had been granted a dose of the experimental biopharmaceutical drug ZMAb, a variant of ZMapp.[196][197][198] ZMapp has previously been used on 3 Liberian health workers, of which 2 survived.[199] It was also used on 4 evacuated westerners, of which 3 survived.[200][201][202][203][204][205] A U.N. employee was evacuated to France in early November 2014 after contracting Ebola.[206]\\r\\nOn 12 November 2014 Dr Martin Salia, a permanent resident of the United States, tested positive for Ebola while working as a specialist surgeon at the Connaught Hospital in Freetown. He is the sixth Sierra Leone doctor to have contracted Ebola virus disease. Initially he preferred to be treated at the Hastings Holding Centre by Sierra Leonean medical personnel, however on 15 November 2014 he was evacuated to the Nebraska Medical Center where his condition was reported as \\"still extremely critical\\" on Sunday 16 November.[207][208][209] On Monday, 16 November the hospital released a statement that he \\"passed away as a result of the advanced symptoms of the disease.\\"[173]\\r\\nOn 18 November a Cuban doctor, Felix Baez, tested positive for Ebola and was due to be sent to Geneva for treatment. He later recovered. Baez was one of 165 Cuban doctors and nurses in Sierra Leone helping treat Ebola patients. There were a further 53 Cubans in Liberia and 38 in Guinea, making this the largest single country medical team mobilized during the outbreak.[210][211]\\r\\nOn October 5, the New York Times reported that a shipping container full of protective gowns, gloves, stretchers, mattresses and other medical supplies had been allowed to sit unopened on the docks in Freetown, Sierra Leone, since August 9.[212] The $140,000 worth of equipment included 100 bags and boxes of hospital linens, 100 cases of protective suits, 80 cases of face masks and other items, and were donated by individuals and institutions in the United States.[212]\\r\\nThe shipment was organised by Mr Chernoh Alpha Bah, a Sierra Leonean opposition politician, who comes from Sierra Leonean President Ernest Bai Koroma's hometown, Makeni.[212] The New York Times reported that political tensions may have contributed to the government delay in clearing the shipping container, to prevent the political opposition from trumpeting the donations.[212]\\r\\nGovernment officials stated that the shipping container could not be cleared through customs, as proper procedures had not been followed.[212] The Sierra Leonean government refused to pay the shipping fee of $6,500.[212] New York Times noted that the government had already received well over $40 million in cash from international donors to fight Ebola.[212] The New York Times noted that in the 2 months that the shipping container remained on the docks in Freetown, health workers in Sierra Leone endured severe shortages of protective supplies, with some nurses having to wear street clothes.[212]\\r\\nDavid Tam-Baryoh, a radio journalist, was held for 11 days when he and a talk show guest, an opposition party spokesperson, criticised how President Ernest Bai Koroma handled the Ebola outbreak in a live broadcast on 1 November 2014. The weekly show Monologue was taken off-air mid-show from the independently run Citizen FM.[213] He was arrested on 3 November and sent to the Pademba Road jail, after an executive order was signed by the president. On 14 November Sierra Leone's Deputy Information Minister Theo Nicol gave a statement that Baryoh had \\"been put on a ten thousand dollar bail by the Criminal Investigation Department after a statement has been taken from him\\".[214]\\r\\nAmid concerns for his health, Tam-Baryoh apparently signed a confession to ensure his release from the prison, engineered by a committee made up of his lawyer, 2 journalists and a peace studies lecturer of the University of Sierra Leone. Rightsway International, an independent human rights group, has condemned President Koroma for allegedly dictating to the committee about obtaining the confession. A statement later released by the group read:[215]\\r\\n\\"Rightsway is disappointed that Tam Baryoh's forced confession has been published widely by pro-government media outlets and social networks. The publication of forced confessions is often used to discredit dissident news and information providers. This is a media propaganda tool used by dictatorial regimes, to avoid being exposed, investigated and punished for the grave violations of human rights.\\"\\r\\nOn October 21, there was Ebola related violence and rioting in the eastern town of Koidu, with police imposing a curfew.[218] Local youth fired at police with shotguns after a former youth leader refused health authorities permission to take her relative for an Ebola test.[218] Several buildings were attacked and youth gangs roamed the streets shouting \\"No more Ebola!\\"[219]\\r\\nA local leader reported seeing two bodies with gunshot wounds in the aftermath. Police denied that anyone had been killed.[218] Doctors reported two dead.[219] The local district medical officer said he had been forced to abandon the local hospital because of the rioting.[218]\\r\\nThere are various restrictions and quarantines within Sierra Leone, and a state of emergency was declared on July 31, 2014.[220] Countries at higher risk for Ebola in Africa include Benin, Burkina Faso, C?te d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, and Senegal.[221]\\r\\nThe outbreak was noted for increasing hand washing stations, and reducing the prevalence of physical greetings such as hand-shakes between members of society.[237]\\r\\nIn June 2014 all schools were closed because of the spread of Ebola.[238]\\r\\nIn August 2014 the S.L.

A former basketball and American football player, LaVar is the founder and CEO of the sports apparel company Big Baller Brand.[5]\\r\\nBall played basketball and American football while at Canoga Park High School. He then played basketball at the collegiate level for West Los Angeles College, Washington State and Cal State Los Angeles. He continued to play American football at Long Beach City College for one season. He later had a short professional career with the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football, and as a practice squad member of the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers in 1995.\\r\\nFollowing a series of bold statements in the spring of 2017, Ball consistently began making national sports headlines for his statements. His early remarks included saying that his son Lonzo is better than Stephen Curry and claiming that he himself could defeat Michael Jordan one-on-one. He was subject to both praise and criticism as he continued making similar comments, some of which involved his company, Big Baller Brand. Ball has made several appearances on national TV and has routinely drawn attention from major sports media outlets like ESPN and Fox Sports.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBall was born on October 23, 1968, and was brought up in South Los Angeles, California.[6][7] He has four brothers, named LaFrance, LaValle, LaRenzo, and LaShon.[7] LaVar attended Canoga Park High School in Canoga Park, Los Angeles, where he was a prominent quarterback on the football team and played basketball as a forward.[8][9] In one season, Ball grabbed a total of 316 rebounds to break the school record.[9] He stood 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) and weighed 225 lbs (102 kg) by college.[8] Aside from sports, Ball majored in criminal justice at college and had hopes of being a U.S. Marshall.[10]\\r\\nBall first began playing college basketball at West Los Angeles College in the low-tier Western State Conference despite having little experience at the prep level. In the season opener in 1986, he recorded 33 points and 18 rebounds against Porterville College.[9] Ball then transferred to NCAA Division I side Washington State and became a starting forward.[11] In 36 games for the Cougars, however; he averaged only 2.2 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 1.0 assists per game.[12] After one season, Ball transferred again to Cal State Los Angeles, which competed in the NCAA Division II, playing alongside three of his four brothers.[13] After his college basketball career had ended, he continued to play American football at Long Beach City College for one season.\\r\\nFollowing college, Ball was invited to a football tryout and eventually made a return to the sport.[1] After finishing his college basketball career, he would play a single year of college football at Long Beach City College as a tight end.[14] On May 1, 1994, Ball signed with the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL) as a defensive end. He returned to the Jets on March 7, 1995 as a tight end and was immediately loaned to the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football (WLAF) the same year.[15] In the 1995 season for the Monarchs, Ball recorded 28 yards in kick returns.[16] During his NFL career, he was also a part of the practice squads of both the Jets and Carolina Panthers, remaining with the latter team until late November 1995, albeit with no yards played due to injury.[17][18] After Ball rose to fame in 2017, his former Monarchs teammate Kenny McEntyre said that he was \\"garbage.\\"[14]\\r\\nIn July 2015, LaVar made national headlines when Gary Parrish of CBSSports.com wrote a feature story about the Ball family.[19] In a March 2016 interview with MaxPreps, he first began displaying his confident personality to the public. When asked who Lonzo plays like, he described his son as \\"Magic (Johnson) with a jumper.\\"[7] The family continued rising in popularity after SLAM magazine featured them in an article in August.[1] LaVar single-handedly drew attention from sports media across the country on November 26, 2016 in a mid-game TV interview with ESPN while UCLA was facing Portland. He said that he guaranteed that UCLA, spearheaded by Lonzo, would win the NCAA championship at the end of the season.[20] On December 14, LaVar predicted that all three of his sons would be one-and-done prospects for the NBA draft.[21] SLAM wrote another article about the family during Christmas, exploring their daily lives.[22] The magazine also published a video titled \\"Christmas Day With The Ball Brothers\\" that would receive over 5.5 million views on YouTube.[23]\\r\\nOn January 26, 2017, in an interview with TMZ Sports, Ball said, \\"My boys want to be the best players ever. People don't want to think that far in front. I've told them this since Day 1, since they've been babies, somebody's got to be better than (Michael) Jordan?\\" He also remarked, \\"When (Lonzo) gets to the pros, the game is even faster and that's when hes at his best.\\"[24] Ball's comments appeared on several networks, including Bleacher Report and NBC Sports.[25][24]\\r\\nIn early March 2017, he remarked that his eldest son Lonzo was a better player than Stephen Curry.[26] Later in the month, he asserted that Lonzo was also better than LeBron James and Russell Westbrook.[27] LaVar additionally said that he believed his three sons would be worth $1 billion for a shoe deal.[28] On March 14, despite having averaged only 2.2 points per game at Washington State, he said, \\"Back in my heyday, I would kill Michael Jordan one-on-one.\\"[29][30] Charles Barkley responded to the claims and challenged Ball to play one-on-one.[31] Ball's claim eventually triggered an response on August 1 from Jordan himself, who said, \\"I don't think he could beat me if I was one-legged.\\"[32] Ball then said that he would beat Jordan one-on-one with his arm tied behind his back.[33]\\r\\nAs Ball rose in popularity, he also became a target of criticism. On February 15, 2017, the news blog The Big Lead encouraged LaVar to \\"shut his mouth\\" and let his sons play.[34] In March 2017, USA Today labeled his comments as an \\"endless string of interviews full of cocky claims and premature promises, coupled with insults.\\"[35] Steve Kerr praised LaVar for gaining publicity but questioned his effect on his sons.[36] On Twitter, many users mocked Ball's perceivably exaggerated claims by using the hashtag #LaVarBallSays and making their own such statements.[4]\\r\\nAs Ball continued to make headlines in the spring of 2017, he became surrounded with more controversy. Forbes labeled him \\"one of the most polarizing figures in sports today.\\"[37] On April 6, 2017, two weeks after Lonzo and UCLA fell to Kentucky in the 2017 NCAA Division I Tournament, Ball said, \\"Realistically you can't win no championship with three white guys because the foot speed is too slow.\\"[38] He was presumably referring to his son's teammates Bryce Alford, T. J. Leaf, and Thomas Welsh.[39] Among Ball's critics for making the remark was actor Michael Rapaport who recorded a profanity-laced rant on LaVar.[40] Later, Ball praised Lonzo's UCLA teammates and instead laid the blame on his son. The team's head coach Steve Alford refused to comment on the situation.[41]\\r\\nOn April 20, George Raveling, the global basketball sports marketing director of Nike, called Ball \\"the worst thing to happen to basketball in the last hundred years.\\"[42][43] In response, Ball claimed that his company Big Baller Brand would eventually compete with Nike. He also remarked in a social media video, \\"I know I'm on the right step, 'cause if nothing like this happened in 100 years?' Guess whatwe in a new lane, baby!\\"[43] In the following week, Nike, Under Armour, and Adidas declined to sign an endorsement deal with Lonzo, according to LaVar.[44][45] Stephon Marbury, who owns the Starbury shoe line, praised Ball for wanting to \\"own his brand.\\"[46]\\r\\nOn May 4, 2017, Big Baller Brand announced its first shoes, the ZO2, which had a retail price of $495 and would be shipped later as late as November 24.[47][48] Shaquille O'Neal criticized Ball for overpricing the shoes, while Dick Vitale took aim at the price by citing Lonzo's performance against Kentucky at the NCAA Tournament.[49][50] On Twitter, many NFL players like Golden Tate were critical of the shoe price, while Arian Foster and others showed their support.[49] Ball answered by posting on Twitter, \\"If you can't afford the ZO2'S, you're NOT a BIG BALLER!\\"[49] The Washington Post wrote that LaVar's decision was both shameless and smart.[49]\\r\\nLaVar also began making several appearances on national television at around this time. On March 23, he appeared on the ESPN show First Take, where he argued with Stephen A. Smith about his bold claims from previous weeks.[51] He returned to the show on March 27 with Lonzo.[52] Ball and his sons starred in a satirical video released by ESPN on April 14, in which rapper Lil Dicky acted as LaVar's fourth son, LiDicky Ball.[53] On May 5, LaVar was interviewed on the ESPN show The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz about the price of the ZO2 shoes.[54] Ramona Shelburne wrote a feature story on May 15 called \\"Speak It Into Being,\\" centered around LaVar's rise to fame, in ESPN The Magazine.[55]\\r\\nWeeks before the 2017 NBA draft, LaVar revealed that Lonzo would only work out for the Los Angeles Lakers.[56] At the draft, in which Lonzo was picked by the Lakers, he was interviewed minutes after the selection.[57] He said, \\"From the words of Zeus, Jesus, everybody says he's going to be a Laker. They told me before they told y'all.\\"[58] Ball also predicted that his son would lead the team to the playoffs as a rookie.[57] A few days after the draft, on June 27, LaVar, with Lonzo and LaMelo, made an appearance at the Staples Center for WWE Monday Night Raw. LaVar removed his shirt, challenged The Miz, who kicked one of many Big Baller Brand mannequins inside the wrestling ring, and ran around the ring.[59] On July 4, Joel Embiid said \\"Man, f--k LaVar Ball\\" in an Instagram Live post.[60] On July 8, Embiid was assessed a $10,000 fine by the NBA for \\"using inappropriate language on social media.\\"[61] LaVar responded back by stating that Embiid's vocabulary was \\"limited\\", that he \\"likely won't be playing by the time his son plays against the 76ers\\", and that he's \\"always plagued with injuries\\".[62]\\r\\nOn May 17, 2017, Ball appeared on The Herd with Colin Cowherd, a show on Fox Sports, and had a heated confrontation with reporter Kristine Leahy.[64] He never faced in Leahy's direction for the whole interview, trying to only talk to Colin Cowherd on the other side.[65] Ball argued with Leahy about if Big Baller Brand should market to both men and women.[64] When she asked Ball how many ZO2 shoes he had already sold, he said, \\"Stay in your lane.\\"[66] Ball also remarked, \\"She scares me. I don't look over there because I'm scared of her. I'm thinking assault right now. Leave me alone.\\"[65] He called Leahy a \\"hater\\" of Big Baller Brand.[66]\\r\\nLater that day on The Herd, Leahy issued a response about her argument with Ball, saying, \\"So he was upset at me for what I said there, and thats completely fine. But you can't come at me and disrespect me and not look me in the eye and threaten me. That's just not OK.\\"[63] Ball, however, denied threatening her.[63] In the days after the appearance, Leahy claimed that she was getting death threats.[67] Following the incident, Big Baller Brand began selling women's clothing on its website. It also started selling T-shirts that read \\"Stay In Yo Lane.\\"[68] The magazine Complex called Ball's choice to sell the potentially controversial shirts \\"his most classless move yet.\\"[69]\\r\\nOn July 22, 2017, while coaching his AAU team, the Big Ballers, at the Double Pump Best of Summer Tournament in Anaheim, California, Ball received a technical foul for arguing a foul call and swearing at a referee.[70] Although his team was leading by 9 points at the time, he chose to forfeit the game and had his players leave the court.[70][71] After leaving he said, \\"It's not about the referee. I'm not gonna have my guys playing hard, and they're cheating. I don't play that shit.\\"[70] On July 26, Ball's AAU team met SC Supreme at the Cashman Center in Las Vegas. The game featured a matchup between the Big Ballers' LaMelo Ball and top high school prospect Zion Williamson.[72] The crowd of about 3,500 quickly filled the stadium and left 1,500 people outside the building. Although several NBA players were in attendance, LeBron James decided to turn back due to the excessively large crowd.[72][73] The New York Post credited LaVar for drawing such a large audience to the game.[74]\\r\\nOn the morning of July 28, as Ball continued to coach his AAU team in Las Vegas vs. highly-rated prospect Immanuel Quickley and Team BBC, a female referee gave him a technical foul.[76][75] After receiving the foul, he threatened to forfeit the game.[77] Ball reportedly pointed at the referee and demanded that she be replaced. Adidas, who ran the event, decided to bring in a new, male referee when the game resumed.[75][78] Later on, Ball was called for a second technical foul, and after he refused to be ejected, the referees decided to end the game.[77] In a post-game interview, he commented on the referee, \\"She's a woman who's trying to actI get that she's trying to break into the referee thing. But just giving techs and calling fouls, that's no way to do it. I know what she trying to say: 'I gave LaVar, I gave him a tech, I'm strong.' That ain't got nothing to do with it. Just call the game.\\"[79] He also said that \\"she's not in shape.\\"[79]\\r\\nDays after the incident, the officiating group for the event, Court Club Elite, cut ties with Adidas.[80] In a statement, they said, \\"Adidas and their leadership acted in a manner that does not parallel our views on integrity or professionalism, and neither should be compromised as they were in this situation.\\"[80] Adidas issued an apology, saying that removing the referee was \\"the wrong decision.\\"[78] In the fallout of the game, several media outlets and newspapers criticized Ball's actions. ESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas wrote an article in which he labeled Ball a \\"misogynistic buffoon unworthy of my time.\\"[81] Kirk Herbstreit showed his support for Bilas's comments regarding Ball.[82] A sports column in the Chicago Tribune called him a \\"media-made Frankenstein unworthy of obsessive coverage.\\"[83]\\r\\nOn September 1, 2017, Big Baller Brand announced a signature shoe for LaMelo Ball, the Melo Ball 1 (MB1), on its website for pre-order for $395.[84] The announcement stirred controversy about whether the shoes would break NCAA rules and possibly make LaMelo ineligible to play at UCLA.[84][85] NCAA spokesperson Emily James said, \\"Generally speaking, a college athlete or prospect paid for use of their athletics reputation or ability risks their future eligibility in that sport. This includes profiting from the sale of items bearing the young person's name. NCAA rules, however, do allow prospects to promote commercial products prior to enrollment, provided it is not for pay.\\"[84] LaVar responded to the questions raised, commenting, \\"We'll worry about it when we get there. Who cares? If he can't play, then he can't play. It doesn't mean he'll stop working out and getting better.\\"[84] Ball, in an interview session with reporters in Chino, California, asserted that the NCAA would not stop the shoe from being released.[86]\\r\\nIn early July 2017, Deadline.com reported that Facebook would be releasing a reality television show featuring the Ball family. It would be a part of a larger project for the social media website to enter the video business.[87] After several weeks, it was announced that the show, called Ball in the Family, would exclusively air on Facebook on August 31, with the following episodes airing every Sunday, starting on September 10.[88][89] It was produced by Bunim/Murray Productions, which also helped create the reality TV series Keeping Up with the Kardashians on E! and Real World on MTV.[90]\\r\\nBall met his wife, Tina, at Cal State Los Angeles, and they have three sons, Lonzo, LiAngelo, and LaMelo.[91] Lonzo is currently a point guard for the Los Angeles Lakers, while LiAngelo is a shooting guard/small forward for the UCLA Bruins men's basketball team, and LaMelo is a junior point guard at Chino Hills High School.\\r\\nAfter his youngest son LaMelo reached four years of age, Ball began training all of his sons to play basketball.[7] They were taught many skills by their father and later played for his Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team, Big Ballers VXT.[13] For a relatively short period of time in their childhoods, LaVar also had them play flag football, with Lonzo playing quarterback and his other sons catching passes.[7] Following an illustrious career at Chino Hills High School in Chino Hills, California, Lonzo became a star at UCLA. LaVar's younger sons play at the same high school and are both committed to UCLA.[92]","input":"How much points did lavar ball average in college?"},{"output":"Qin Shi Huang","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nHuang-Lao\\r\\n\\r\\nQin Shi Huang (Chinese: a; literally: \\"First Emperor of Qin\\", ?pronunciation?(help{info); 18 February 259?BC?ÿ 10 September 210?BC) was the founder of the Qin dynasty and was the first emperor of a unified China.

His self-invented title \\"emperor\\" ( ?hungd), as indicated by his use of the word \\"First\\", would continue to be borne by Chinese rulers for the next two millennia.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his reign, his generals greatly expanded the size of the Chinese state: campaigns south of Chu permanently added the Yue lands of Hunan and Guangdong to the Chinese cultural orbit; campaigns in Central Asia conquered the Ordos Loop from the nomad Xiongnu, although eventually it would also lead to their confederation under Modu Chanyu. Qin Shi Huang also worked with his minister Li Si to enact major economic and political reforms aimed at the standardization of the diverse practices of the earlier Chinese states.[2] He is traditionally said to have banned and burned many books and executed scholars, though a closer examination renders the account doubtful.[3] His public works projects included the unification of diverse state walls into a single Great Wall of China and a massive new national road system, as well as the city-sized mausoleum guarded by the life-sized Terracotta Army. He ruled until his death in 210?BC during his fourth tour of Eastern China.[4] His achievements made him one of the most respected and influential individuals in world history, and a legacy among the Chinese.[5][6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Chinese sources often give the personal name of Qin Shi Huang as Ying Zheng, with Ying () taken as the surname and Zheng () the given name. In ancient China however the naming convention differed, and Zhao (f) may be used as the surname. Unlike modern Chinese names, the nobles of ancient China had two distinct surnames: the ancestral name (n) comprised a larger group descended from a prominent ancestor, usually said to have lived during the time of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors of Chinese legend, and the clan name () comprised a smaller group that showed a branch's current fief or recent title. (This is remarkably similar to the practice of contemporary Romans for naming men, such as M. Tullius Cicero and C. Julius Caesar.) The ancient practice was to list men's names separatelySima Qian's \\"Basic Annals of the First Emperor of Qin\\" introduces him as \\"given the name Zheng and the surname Zhao\\"[9][11]or to combine the clan surname with the personal name: Sima's account of Chu describes the sixteenth year of the reign of King Kaolie as \\"the time when Zhao?Zheng was enthroned as King of Qin\\".[12] However, since modern Chinese surnames (despite usually descending from clan names) use the same character as the old ancestral names, it is much more common in modern Chinese sources to see the emperor's personal name written as Ying?Zheng,[13] using the ancestral name of the Ying family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rulers of Qin had styled themselves kings from the time of King Huiwen in 325?BC. Upon his ascension, Zheng became known as the King of Qin[9][10] or King Zheng of Qin.[14][15] This title made him the nominal equal of the rulers of Shang and of Zhou, the last of whose kings had been deposed by King Zhaoxiang of Qin in 256?BC.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the surrender of Qi in 221?BC, King Zheng had reunited all of the lands of the former Kingdom of Zhou. Rather than maintain his rank as king, however,[16] he created a new title of hungd (emperor) for himself. This new title combined two titleshung of the mythical Three Sovereigns (??, Sn Hung) and the d of the legendary Five Emperors (, W? D) of Chinese prehistory.[17] The title was intended to appropriate some of the prestige of the Yellow Emperor,[18] whose cult was popular in the later Warring States period and who was considered to be a founder of the Chinese people. King Zheng chose the new regnal name of First?Emperor (Sh?Hungd, formerly transcribed as Shih?Huang-ti)[19] on the understanding that his successors would be successively titled the \\"Second Emperor\\", \\"Third Emperor\\", and so on through the generations. (In fact, the scheme lasted only as long as his immediate heir, the Second Emperor.)[20] The new title carried religious overtones. For that reason, Sinologistsstarting with Peter Boodberg[21] or Edward Schafer[22]sometimes translate it as \\"thearch\\" and the First Emperor as the First?Thearch.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Emperor intended that his realm would remain intact through the ages but, following its overthrow and replacement by Han after his death, it became customary to prefix his title with Qin. Thus:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as Sima Qian, it was common to shorten the resulting four-character Qin Shi Huangdi to a,[28] variously transcribed as Qin Shihuang or Qin Shi Huang.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing his elevation as emperor, both Zheng's personal name  and possibly its homophone B[30] became taboo.[31] The First Emperor also arrogated the first-person Chinese pronoun T (OC?*lr?m,[32] mod.?zhn) for his exclusive use[34] and in 212?BC began calling himself The?Immortal (R??, OC?*Tin-ni?,[32] mod.?Zhnrn, lit.?\\"True?Man\\").[16] Others were to address him as \\"Your?Majesty\\" (컪B, mod.?Bxi, lit.?\\"Beneath the Palace[35] Steps\\") in person and \\"Your?Highness\\" (f) in writing.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Records of the Grand Historian, written by Sima Qian during the Han dynasty, the first emperor was the eldest son of the Qin prince Yiren, who later became King Zhuangxiang of Qin. Prince Yiren at that time was residing at the court of Zhao, serving as a hostage to guarantee the armistice between the Qin and Zhao states.[1][36] Prince Yiren had fallen in love at first sight with a concubine of L Buwei, a rich merchant from the State of Wey. L consented for her to be Yiren's wife, who then became known as Lady Zhao (Zhao Ji) after the state of Zhao. Lady Zhao gave birth to the child on 18 February; and he was given the name Zhao Zheng ÿ the name Zheng (B) came from his month of birth Zhengyue, the first month of the Chinese lunar calendar;[36] the clan name of Zhao came from his father's lineage and was unrelated to either his mother's name or the location of his birth.[citation needed] L Buwei's machinations later helped Yiren become King Zhuangxiang of Qin[3] in 250 BC.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the Records of the Grand Historian also claimed that the first emperor was not the actual son of Prince Yiren but that of L Buwei.[37] According to this account, when L Buwei introduced the dancing girl to the prince, she was L Buwei's concubine and had already become pregnant by him, and the baby was born after an unusually long period of pregnancy.[37] According to translations of the Annals of L Buwei, Zhao Ji gave birth to the future emperor in the city of Handan in 259 BC, the first month of the 48th year of King Zhaoxiang of Qin.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that the emperor was an illegitimate child, widely believed throughout Chinese history, contributed to the generally negative view of the First Emperor.[1] However, a number of modern scholars have doubted this account of his birth. Sinologist Derk Bodde wrote: \\"There is good reason for believing that the sentence describing this unusual pregnancy is an interpolation added to the Shih-chi by an unknown person in order to slander the First Emperor and indicate his political as well as natal illegitimacy\\".[39] John Knoblock and Jeffrey Riegel, in their translation of L Buwei's Spring and Autumn Annals, call the story \\"patently false, meant both to libel L and to cast aspersions on the First Emperor\\".[40] Claiming L Buwei ÿ a merchant ÿ as the First Emperor's biological father was meant to be especially disparaging, since later Confucian society regarded merchants as the lowest of all social classes.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 246 BC, when King Zhuangxiang died after a short reign of just three years, he was succeeded on the throne by his 13-year-old son.[42] At the time, Zhao Zheng was still young, so L Buwei acted as the regent prime minister of the State of Qin, which was still waging war against the other six states.[1] Nine years later, in 235 BC, Zhao Zheng assumed full power after L Buwei was banished for his involvement in a scandal with Queen Dowager Zhao.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nZhao Chengjiao, the Lord Chang'an (ٝ),[45] was Zhao Zheng's legitimate half-brother, by the same father but from a different mother. After Zhao Zheng inherited the throne, Chengjiao rebelled at Tunliu and surrendered to the state of Zhao. Chengjiao's remaining retainers and families were executed by Zhao Zheng.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs King Zheng grew older, L Buwei became fearful that the boy king would discover his liaison with his mother Lady Zhao. He decided to distance himself and look for a replacement for the queen dowager. He found a man named Lao Ai.[47] According to The Record of Grand Historian, Lao Ai was disguised as a eunuch by plucking his beard. Later Lao Ai and queen Zhao Ji got along so well they secretly had two sons together.[47] Lao Ai then became ennobled as Marquis Lo Ҋi, and was showered with riches. Lao Ai's plot was supposed to replace King Zheng with one of the hidden sons. But during a dinner party drunken Lo Ҋi was heard bragging about being the young king's step father.[47] In 238 BC the king was travelling to the ancient capital of Yng (). Lao Ai seized the queen mother's seal and mobilized an army in an attempt to start a coup and rebel.[47] When King Zheng found out this fact, he ordered L Buwei to let Lord Changping and Lord Changwen attack Lao Ai and their army killed hundreds of the rebels at the capital, although Lao Ai succeeded in fleeing from this battle.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nA price of 1 million copper coins was placed on Lao Ai's head if he was taken alive or half a million if dead.[47] Lao Ai's supporters were captured and beheaded; then Lao Ai was tied up and torn to five pieces by horse carriages, while his entire family was executed to the third degree.[47] The two hidden sons were also killed, while mother Zhao Ji was placed under house arrest until her death many years later. L Buwei drank a cup of poison wine and committed suicide in 235 BC.[1][47] Ying Zheng then assumed full power as the King of the Qin state. Replacing L Buwei, Li Si became the new chancellor.\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Zheng and his troops continued to take over different states. The state of Yan was small, weak and frequently harassed by soldiers. It was no match for the Qin state.[4] So Crown Prince Dan of Yan plotted an assassination attempt to get rid of King Zheng, begging Jing Ke to go on the mission in 227 BC.[3][4] Jing Ke was accompanied by Qin Wuyang in the plot. Each was supposed to present a gift to King Zheng: a map of Dukang and the severed head of Fan Wuji.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nQin Wuyang first tried to present the map case gift, but trembled in fear and moved no further towards the king. Jing Ke continued to advance toward the king, while explaining that his partner \\"has never set eyes on the Son of Heaven\\", which is why he is trembling. Jing Ke had to present both gifts by himself.[4] While unrolling the map, a dagger was revealed. The king drew back, stood on his feet, but struggled to draw the sword to defend himself.[4] At the time, other palace officials were not allowed to carry weapons. Jing Ke pursued the king, attempting to stab him, but missed. King Zheng drew out his sword and cut Jing Ke's thigh. Jing Ke then threw the dagger, but missed again. Suffering eight wounds from the king's sword, Jing Ke realized his attempt had failed and knew that both of them would be killed afterwards.[4] The Yan state was conquered by the Qin state five years later.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nGao Jianli was a close friend of Jing Ke, who wanted to avenge his death.[49] As a famous lute player, one day he was summoned by King Zheng to play the instrument. Someone in the palace who had known him in the past exclaimed, \\"This is Gao Jianli\\".[50] Unable to bring himself to kill such a skilled musician, the emperor ordered his eyes put out.[50] But the king allowed Gao Jianli to play in his presence.[50] He praised the playing and even allowed Gao Jianli to get closer. As part of the plot, the lute was fastened with a heavy piece of lead. He raised the lute and struck at the king. He missed, and his assassination attempt failed. Gao Jianli was later executed.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 230 BC, King Zheng unleashed the final campaigns of the Warring States period, setting out to conquer the remaining independent kingdoms, one by one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first state to fall was Hn (g; sometimes called Hann to distinguish it from the Hn ?h of Han dynasty), in 230 BC. Then Qin took advantage of natural disasters in 229 BC to invade and conquer Zho, where Qin Shi Huang had been born.[51][52] He now avenged his poor treatment as a child hostage there, seeking out and killing his enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nQin armies conquered the state of Zhao in 228 BC, the northern country of Yan in 226 BC, the small state of Wei in 225 BC, and the largest state and greatest challenge, Chu, in 223 BC.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 222 BC, the last remnants of Yan and the royal family were captured in Liaodong in the northeast. The only independent country left was now state of Qi, in the far east, what is now the Shandong peninsula. Terrified, the young king of Qi sent 200,000 people to defend his western borders. In 221 BC, the Qin armies invaded from the north, captured the king, and annexed Qi. Some of the strategies Qin used to unify China were to standardize the trade and communication, currency and language.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time, all Chinese lands were unified under one powerful ruler. In that same year, King Zheng proclaimed himself the \\"First Emperor\\" (a, Sh Hungd), no longer a king in the old sense and now far surpassing the achievements of the old Zhou Dynasty rulers.[54] The emperor made the He Shi Bi into the Imperial Seal, known as the \\"Heirloom Seal of the Realm\\". The words, \\"Having received the Mandate from Heaven, may (the emperor) lead a long and prosperous life.\\" (wvە?h?) were written by Prime Minister Li Si, and carved onto the seal by Sun Shou. The Seal was later passed from emperor to emperor for generations to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the South, military expansion in the form of campaigns against the Yue tribes continued during his reign, with various regions being annexed to what is now Guangdong province and part of today's Vietnam.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an attempt to avoid a recurrence of the political chaos of the Warring States period, Qin Shi Huang and his prime minister Li Si completely abolished feudalism.[52] The empire was then divided into 36 commanderies (h, Jn), later more than 40 commanderies.[52] The whole of China was thus divided into administrative units: first commanderies, then counties (Ƴ, Xin), townships (ڝ, Xing) and hundred-family units (, Li, which roughly corresponds to the modern-day subdistricts and communities).[55] This system was different from the previous dynasties, which had loose alliances and federations.[56] People could no longer be identified by their native region or former feudal state, as when a person from Chu was called \\"Chu person\\" (??, Chu rn).[55][57] Appointments were subsequently based on merit instead of hereditary rights.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nQin Shi Huang and Li Si unified China economically by standardizing the Chinese units of measurements such as weights and measures, the currency, and the length of the axles of carts to facilitate transport on the road system.[56] The emperor also developed an extensive network of roads and canals connecting the provinces to improve trade between them.[56] The currency of the different states were also standardized to the Ban liang coin (??, Bn LiҊng).[55] Perhaps most importantly, the Chinese script was unified. Under Li Si, the seal script of the state of Qin was standardized through removal of variant forms within the Qin script itself. This newly standardized script was then made official throughout all the conquered regions, thus doing away with all the regional scripts to form one language, one communication system for all of China.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nQin Shi Huang also followed the school of the five elements, earth, wood, metal, fire and water. (Ca) Zhao Zheng's birth element is water, which is connected with the colour black. It was also believed that the royal house of the previous dynasty Zhou had ruled by the power of fire, which was the colour red. The new Qin dynasty must be ruled by the next element on the list, which is water, represented by the colour black. Black became the colour for garments, flags, pennants.[1] Other associations include north as the cardinal direction, winter season and the number six.[58] Tallies and official hats were 15 centimetres (5.9 inches) long, carriages two metres (6.6 feet) wide, one pace (; B) was 1.4 metres (4.6?ft).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the previous Warring States era was one of constant warfare, it was also considered the golden age of free thought.[59] Qin Shi Huang eliminated the Hundred Schools of Thought which incorporated Confucianism and other philosophies.[59][60] After the unification of China, with all other schools of thought banned, legalism became the endorsed ideology of the Qin dynasty,[55] which was basically a system that required the people to follow the laws or be punished accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 213 BC, at the instigation of Li Si and to avoid scholars' comparisons of his reign with the past, Qin Shi Huang ordered most existing books to be burned with the exception of those on astrology, agriculture, medicine, divination, and the history of the State of Qin.[61] This would also serve the purpose of furthering the ongoing reformation of the writing system by removing examples of obsolete scripts.[62] Owning the Book of Songs or the Classic of History was to be punished especially severely. According to the later Records of the Grand Historian, the following year Qin Shi Huang had some 460 scholars buried alive for owning the forbidden books.[1][61] The emperor's oldest son Fusu criticised him for this act.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent research suggests that the \\"burying of the Confucian scholars alive\\" is a Confucian martyrs' legend; rather, the emperor ordered the killing (C kng) of a group of alchemists after having found that they had fooled him. In Han times, the Confucian scholars, who had served the Qin loyally, used that incident to distance themselves from the failed dynasty. Kong Anguo (^?? c. 165 ÿ c. 74 BC), a descendant of Confucius, turned the alchemists (Դ fngsh) into Confucianists (?? r~) and entwined the martyrs' legend with the strange story of the rediscovery of the lost Confucian books behind a demolished wall in the house of his ancestors.[64] The emperor's own library still had copies of the forbidden books but most of these were destroyed later when Xiang Yu burned the palaces of Xianyang in 206 BC.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 230 BC, the state of Qin had defeated the state of Han. A Han aristocrat named Zhang Liang swore revenge on the Qin emperor. He sold all his valuables and in 218 BC, he hired a strongman assassin and built him a heavy metal cone weighing 120 jin (roughly 160?lb or 97?kg).[47] The two men hid among the bushes along the emperor's route over a mountain. At a signal, the muscular assassin hurled the cone at the first carriage and shattered it. However, the emperor was actually in the second carriage, as he was travelling with two identical carriages for this very reason. Thus the attempt failed.[66] Both men were able to escape in spite of a huge manhunt.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Qin fought nomadic tribes to the north and north-west. The Xiongnu tribes were not defeated and subdued, thus the campaign was tiring and unsuccessful, and to prevent the Xiongnu from encroaching on the northern frontier any longer, the emperor ordered the construction of an immense defensive wall.[52][67][68] This wall, for whose construction hundreds of thousands of men were mobilized, and an unknown number died, is a precursor to the current Great Wall of China. It connected numerous state walls which had been built during the previous four centuries, a network of small walls linking river defences to impassable cliffs.[69][70]\\r\\n\\r\\nA famous South China quotation was \\"In the North there is the Great wall, in the South there is the Lingqu canal\\" (ܩyqF?, Biyu chngchng, nnyu lngq~).[71] In 214 BC the Emperor began the project of a major canal to transport supplies to the army.[72] The canal allows water transport between north and south China.[72] The canal, 34 kilometres in length, links the Xiang River which flows into the Yangtze and the Li Jiang, which flows into the Pearl River.[72] The canal connected two of China's major waterways and aided Qin's expansion into the south-west.[72] The construction is considered one of the three great feats of Ancient Chinese engineering, the others being the Great Wall and the Sichuan Dujiangyan Irrigation System.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in his life, Qin Shi Huang feared death and desperately sought the fabled elixir of life, which would supposedly allow him to live forever. He was obsessed with acquiring immortality and fell prey to many who offered him supposed elixirs.[73] He visited Zhifu Island three times in order to achieve immortality.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one case he sent Xu Fu, a Zhifu islander, with ships carrying hundreds of young men and women in search of the mystical Penglai mountain.[66] They were sent to find Anqi Sheng, a 1,000-year-old magician whom Qin Shi Huang had supposedly met in his travels and who had invited him to seek him there.[75] These people never returned, perhaps because they knew that if they returned without the promised elixir, they would surely be executed. Legends claim that they reached Japan and colonized it.[73] It is also possible that the book burning, a purge on what could be seen as wasteful and useless literature, was, in part, an attempt to focus the minds of the Emperor's best scholars on the alchemical quest. Some of the executed scholars were those who had been unable to offer any evidence of their supernatural schemes. This may have been the ultimate means of testing their abilities: if any of them had magic powers, then they would surely come back to life when they were let out again.[76] Since the great emperor was afraid of death and \\"evil spirits\\", he had workers build a series of tunnels and passageways to each of his palaces (he owned over 200), because traveling unseen would supposedly keep him safe from the evil spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 211 BC a large meteor is said to have fallen in Dngjn (?|h) in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. On it, an unknown person inscribed the words \\"The First Emperor will die and his land will be divided\\" (a㑁WA).[77] When the emperor heard of this, he sent an imperial secretary to investigate this prophecy. No one would confess to the deed, so all the people living nearby were put to death. The stone was then burned and pulverized.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his fourth tour of Eastern China, the Emperor became seriously ill after he arrived in Pingyuanjin (Pingyuan County, Shandong), and died on 10 September 210 BC (Julian Calendar) at the palace in Shaqiu prefecture (हL, Shqi Pngti), about two months away by road from the capital Xianyang.[4][4][78][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cause of Qin Shi Huang's death is still largely unknown, reportedly, he died from Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning due to ingesting mercury pills, made by his alchemists and court physicians, believing it to be an elixir of immortality.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Emperor's death, Prime Minister Li Si, who accompanied him, became extremely worried that the news of his death could trigger a general uprising in the Empire.[4] It would take two months for the entourage to reach the capital, and it would not be possible to stop the uprising. Li Si decided to hide the death of the Emperor, and return to Xianyang.[4] Most of the Imperial entourage accompanying the Emperor were left ignorant of the Emperor's death; only a younger son, Ying Huhai, who was travelling with his father, the eunuch Zhao Gao, Li Si, and five or six favourite eunuchs knew of the death.[4] Li Si also ordered that two carts containing rotten fish be carried immediately before and after the wagon of the Emperor. The idea behind this was to prevent people from noticing the foul smell emanating from the wagon of the Emperor, where his body was starting to decompose severely as it was summertime.[4] They also pulled down the shade so no one could see his face, changed his clothes daily, brought food and when he had to have important conversations, they would act as if he wanted to send them a message.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, after about two months, Li Si and the imperial court reached Xianyang, where the news of the death of the emperor was announced.[4] Qin Shi Huang did not like to talk about his own death and he had never written a will. After his death, the eldest son Fusu would normally become the next emperor.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nLi Si and the chief eunuch Zhao Gao conspired to kill Fusu because Fusu's favorite general was Meng Tian, whom they disliked[81] and feared; Meng Tian's brother, a senior minister, had once punished Zhao Gao.[82] They believed that if Fusu was enthroned, they would lose their power.[81] Li Si and Zhao Gao forged a letter from Qin Shi Huang saying that both Fusu and General Meng must commit suicide.[81] The plan worked, and the younger son Hu Hai became the Second Emperor, later known as Qin Er Shi or \\"Second Generation Qin\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nQin Er Shi, however, was not as capable as his father. Revolts quickly erupted. His reign was a time of extreme civil unrest, and everything built by the First Emperor crumbled away within a short period.[52] One of the immediate revolt attempts was the 209 BC Daze Village Uprising led by Chen Sheng and Wu Guang.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following are some family members of Qin Shi Huang:\\r\\n\\r\\nQin Shi Huang had about 50 children (about 30 sons and 15 daughters), but most of their names are unknown. He had numerous concubines but appeared to have never named an empress.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese historian Sima Qian, writing a century after the First Emperor's death, wrote that it took 700,000 men to construct the emperor's mausoleum. British historian John Man points out that this figure is larger than the population of any city in the world at that time and he calculates that the foundations could have been built by 16,000 men in two years.[86] While Sima Qian never mentioned the terracotta army, the statues were discovered by a group of farmers digging wells on March 29, 1974.[87] The soldiers were created with a series of mix-and-match clay molds and then further individualized by the artists' hand. Han Purple was also used on some of the warriors.[88] \\r\\nThere are around 6,000 Terracotta Warriors and their purpose was to protect the Emperor in the afterlife from evil spirits. Also among the army are chariots and 40,000 real bronze weapons.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first projects which the young king accomplished while he was alive was the construction of his own tomb. In 215 BC Qin Shi Huang ordered General Meng Tian to begin its construction with the assistance of 300,000 men.[1] Other sources suggest that he ordered 720,000 unpaid laborers to build his tomb according to his specifications.[42] Again, given John Man's observation regarding populations at the time (see paragraph above), these historical estimates are debatable. The main tomb (located at 342252.75N 1091513.06E? / ?34.3813194N 109.2536278E? / 34.3813194; 109.2536278) containing the emperor has yet to be opened and there is evidence suggesting that it remains relatively intact.[90] Sima Qian's description of the tomb includes replicas of palaces and scenic towers, \\"rare utensils and wonderful objects\\", 100 rivers made with mercury, representations of \\"the heavenly bodies\\", and crossbows rigged to shoot anyone who tried to break in.[91] The tomb was built at the foot of Mount Li, 30 kilometers away from Xi'an. Modern archaeologists have located the tomb, and have inserted probes deep into it. The probes revealed abnormally high quantities of mercury, some 100 times the naturally occurring rate, suggesting that some parts of the legend are credible.[80] Secrets were maintained, as most of the workmen who built the tomb were killed.[80][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional Chinese historiography almost always portrayed the First Emperor of the Chinese unified states as a brutal tyrant who had an obsessive fear of assassination. Ideological antipathy towards the Legalist State of Qin was established as early as 266 BC, when Confucian philosopher Xunzi disparaged it.[citation needed] Later Confucian historians condemned the emperor who had burned the classics and had buried Confucian scholars alive. They eventually compiled a list of the Ten Crimes of Qin to highlight his tyrannical actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe famous Han poet and statesman Jia Yi concluded his essay The Faults of Qin (?, Gu Qn Ln) with what was to become the standard Confucian judgment of the reasons for Qin's collapse. Jia Yi's essay, admired as a masterpiece of rhetoric and reasoning, was copied into two great Han histories and has had a far-reaching influence on Chinese political thought as a classic illustration of Confucian theory.[93] He attributed Qin's disintegration to its internal failures.[94] Jia Yi wrote that:\\r\\n\\r\\nQin, from a tiny base, had become a great power, ruling the land and receiving homage from all quarters for a hundred odd years. Yet after they unified the land and secured themselves within the pass, a single common rustic could nevertheless challenge this empire... Why? Because the ruler lacked humaneness and rightness; because preserving power differs fundamentally from seizing power.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn more modern times, historical assessment of the First Emperor different from traditional Chinese historiography began to emerge. The reassessment was spurred on by the weakness of China in the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th century. At that time some began to regard Confucian traditions as an impediment to China's entry into the modern world, opening the way for changing perspectives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a time when foreign nations encroached upon Chinese territory, leading Kuomintang historian Xiao Yishan emphasized the role of Qin Shi Huang in repulsing the northern barbarians, particularly in the construction of the Great Wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother historian, Ma Feibai (ʿ), published in 1941 a full-length revisionist biography of the First Emperor entitled Qn Sh Hungd Zhun (a??), calling him \\"one of the great heroes of Chinese history\\". Ma compared him with the contemporary leader Chiang Kai-shek and saw many parallels in the careers and policies of the two men, both of whom he admired. Chiang's Northern Expedition of the late 1920s, which directly preceded the new Nationalist government at Nanjing was compared to the unification brought about by Qin Shi Huang.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the coming of the Communist Revolution and the establishment of a new, revolutionary regime in 1949, another re-evaluation of the First Emperor emerged as a Marxist critique. This new interpretation of Qin Shi Huang was generally a combination of traditional and modern views, but essentially critical. This is exemplified in the Complete History of China, which was compiled in September 1955 as an official survey of Chinese history. The work described the First Emperor's major steps toward unification and standardisation as corresponding to the interests of the ruling group and the merchant class, not of the nation or the people, and the subsequent fall of his dynasty as a manifestation of the class struggle. The perennial debate about the fall of the Qin Dynasty was also explained in Marxist terms, the peasant rebellions being a revolt against oppression ÿ a revolt which undermined the dynasty, but which was bound to fail because of a compromise with \\"landlord class elements\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1972, however, a radically different official view of Qin Shi Huang in accordance with Maoist thought has been given prominence throughout China. Hong Shidi's biography Qin Shi Huang initiated the re-evaluation. The work was published by the state press as a mass popular history, and it sold 1.85 million copies within two years. In the new era, Qin Shi Huang was seen as a far-sighted ruler who destroyed the forces of division and established the first unified, centralized state in Chinese history by rejecting the past. Personal attributes, such as his quest for immortality, so emphasized in traditional historiography, were scarcely mentioned. The new evaluations described approvingly how, in his time (an era of great political and social change), he had no compunctions against using violent methods to crush counter-revolutionaries, such as the \\"industrial and commercial slave owner\\" chancellor L Buwei. However, he was criticized for not being as thorough as he should have been, and as a result, after his death, hidden subversives under the leadership of the chief eunuch Zhao Gao were able to seize power and use it to restore the old feudal order.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo round out this re-evaluation, Luo Siding put forward a new interpretation of the precipitous collapse of the Qin Dynasty in an article entitled \\"On the Class Struggle During the Period Between Qin and Han\\" in a 1974 issue of Red Flag, to replace the old explanation. The new theory claimed that the cause of the fall of Qin lay in the lack of thoroughness of Qin Shi Huang's \\"dictatorship over the reactionaries, even to the extent of permitting them to worm their way into organs of political authority and usurp important posts.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMao Zedong, chairman of the People's Republic of China, was reviled[by whom?] for his persecution of intellectuals. On being compared to the First Emperor, Mao responded: \\r\\n\\"He buried 460 scholars alive; we have buried forty-six thousand scholars alive... You [intellectuals] revile us for being Qin Shi Huangs. You are wrong. We have surpassed Qin Shi Huang a hundredfold. When you berate us for imitating his despotism, we are happy to agree! Your mistake was that you did not say so enough.\\"[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Ambrose characterises Qin Shi Huang as the founder of \\"the first police state in history\\".[97]","input":"Who was the first emperor of ancient china?"},{"output":"The Church of God in Christ","context":"Christianity is the most adhered to religion in the United States, with 75% of polled American adults identifying themselves as Christian in 2015.[1][2] This is down from 85% in 1990, lower than 81.6% in 2001,[3] and slightly lower than 78% in 2012.[4] About 62% of those polled claim to be members of a church congregation.[5] The United States has the largest Christian population in the world, with nearly 240 million Christians, although other countries have higher percentages of Christians among their populations. The modern official motto of the United States of America, as established in a 1956 law signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, is \\"In God We Trust\\".[6][7][8] The phrase first appeared on U.S. coins in 1864.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Protestant denominations accounted for 51.3%, while the Catholic Church by itself, at 23.9%, was the largest individual denomination. A 2008 Pew study categorizes white evangelical Protestants, 26.3% of the population, as the country's largest religious cohort;[9] another study in 2004 estimates evangelical Protestants of all races at 30ÿ35%.[10] The nation's second-largest church and the single largest Protestant denomination is the Southern Baptist Convention.[11] The United Methodist Church is the third largest church and the largest mainline Protestant denomination in the United States.[12] The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) is the fourth-largest church in the United States and the largest church originating in the U.S.[13][14] The Church of God in Christ is the fifth-largest denomination, the largest Pentecostal church, and the largest traditionally African-American denomination in the nation.[11] Among Eastern Christian denominations, there are several Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches, with just below 1 million adherents in the US, or 0.4% of the total population.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nChristianity was introduced to the Americas as it was first colonized by Europeans beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries. Going forward from its foundation, the United States has been called a Protestant nation by a variety of sources.[16][17][18][19] Immigration further increased Christian numbers. Today most Christian churches in the United States are either Mainline Protestant, Evangelical Protestant, or Catholic.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican-American Baptist\\r\\n\\r\\nOriental Orthodox\\r\\n\\r\\nOneness Pentecostal\\r\\n\\r\\nChristian denominations in the United States are usually divided into three large groups: Evangelical Protestantism, Mainline Protestantism, and the Catholic Church. There are also Christian denominations that do not fall within either of these groups, such as Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy, but they are much smaller.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2004 survey of the United States identified the percentages of these groups as 26.3% (Evangelical), 22% (Catholics), and 16% (Mainline Protestant).[10] In a Statistical Abstract of the United States, based on a 2001 study of the self-described religious identification of the adult population, the percentages for these same groups are 28.6% (Evangelical), 24.5% (Catholics), and 13.9% (Mainline Protestant).[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn typical usage, the term mainline is contrasted with evangelical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) counts 26,344,933 members of mainline churches versus 39,930,869 members of evangelical Protestant churches.[22] There is evidence that there has been a shift in membership from mainline denominations to evangelical churches.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs shown in the table below, some denominations with similar names and historical ties to Evangelical groups are considered Mainline.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEvangelicalism is a Protestant Christian movement. In typical usage, the term mainline is contrasted with evangelical. Theologically conservative critics accuse the mainline churches of \\"the substitution of leftist social action for Christian evangelizing, and the disappearance of biblical theology,\\" and maintain that \\"All the Mainline churches have become essentially the same church: their histories, their theologies, and even much of their practice lost to a uniform vision of social progress.\\"[25] Most adherents consider the key characteristics of evangelicalism to be: a belief in the need for personal conversion (or being \\"born again\\"); some expression of the gospel in effort; a high regard for Biblical authority; and an emphasis on the death and resurrection of Jesus.[26] David Bebbington has termed these four distinctive aspects conversionism, activism, biblicism, and crucicentrism, saying, \\"Together they form a quadrilateral of priorities that is the basis of Evangelicalism.\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that the term \\"Evangelical\\" does not equal Fundamentalist Christianity, although the latter is sometimes regarded simply as the most theologically conservative subset of the former. The major differences largely hinge upon views of how to regard and approach scripture (\\"Theology of Scripture\\"), as well as construing its broader world-view implications. While most conservative Evangelicals believe the label has broadened too much beyond its more limiting traditional distinctives, this trend is nonetheless strong enough to create significant ambiguity in the term.[28] As a result, the dichotomy between \\"evangelical\\" vs. \\"mainline\\" denominations is increasingly complex (particularly with such innovations as the \\"Emergent Church\\" movement).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contemporary North American usage of the term is influenced by the evangelical/fundamentalist controversy of the early 20th century. Evangelicalism may sometimes be perceived as the middle ground between the theological liberalism of the Mainline (Protestant) denominations and the cultural separatism of Fundamentalist Christianity.[29] Evangelicalism has therefore been described as \\"the third of the leading strands in American Protestantism, straddl[ing] the divide between fundamentalists and liberals.\\"[30] While the North American perception is important to understand the usage of the term, it by no means dominates a wider global view, where the fundamentalist debate was not so influential.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as Evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of the world. At the same time, they criticized their fellow Fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the Social Gospel as it had been developed by Protestant activists of the previous century. They charged the modernists with having lost their identity as Evangelicals and the Fundamentalists with having lost the Christ-like heart of Evangelicalism. They argued that the Gospel needed to be reasserted to distinguish it from the innovations of the liberals and the fundamentalists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sought allies in denominational churches and liturgical traditions, disregarding views of eschatology and other \\"non-essentials,\\" and joined also with Trinitarian varieties of Pentecostalism. They believed that in doing so, they were simply re-acquainting Protestantism with its own recent tradition. The movement's aim at the outset was to reclaim the Evangelical heritage in their respective churches, not to begin something new; and for this reason, following their separation from Fundamentalists, the same movement has been better known merely as \\"Evangelicalism.\\" By the end of the 20th century, this was the most influential development in American Protestant Christianity.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Association of Evangelicals is a U.S. agency which coordinates cooperative ministry for its member denominations.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2015 global census estimated some 450,000 believers in Christ from a Muslim background in the United States most of whom are evangelicals or Pentecostals.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mainline Protestant Christian denominations are those Protestant denominations that were brought to the United States by its historic immigrant groups; for this reason they are sometimes referred to as heritage churches.[32] The largest are the Episcopal (English), Presbyterian (Scottish), Methodist (English and Welsh), and Lutheran (German and Scandinavian) churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nMainline Protestantism, including the Episcopalians (76%),[33] the Presbyterians (64%),[33] and the United Church of Christ has the highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita,[2] of any other Christian denomination in the United States,[34] as well as the most high-income earners.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nEpiscopalians and Presbyterians tend to be considerably wealthier[36] and better educated than most other religious groups in Americans,[37] and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business,[38] law and politics, especially the Republican Party.[39] Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and Astors, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Whitney, Morgans, and Harrimans are historically Mainline Protestant families.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States by Harriet Zuckerman, a review of American Nobel prizes winners awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American Nobel Prize Laureates, have identified from a Protestant background.[40] Overall, 84.2% of all the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in Chemistry,[40] 60% in Medicine,[40] and 58.6% in Physics[40] between 1901 and 1972 were won by Protestants.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the first colleges and universities in America, including Harvard,[41] Yale,[42] Princeton,[43] Columbia,[44] Dartmouth, Williams, Bowdoin, Middlebury, and Amherst, all were founded by the Mainline Protestantism, as were later Carleton, Duke,[45] Oberlin, Beloit, Pomona, Rollins and Colorado College.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany mainline denominations teach that the Bible is God's word in function, but tend to be open to new ideas and societal changes.[46] They have been increasingly open to the ordination of women.\\r\\n\\r\\nMainline churches tend to belong to organizations such as the National Council of Churches and World Council of Churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seven largest U.S. mainline denominations were called by William Hutchison the \\"Seven Sisters of American Protestantism\\"[47][48] in reference to the major liberal groups during the period between 1900 and 1960.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives also considers these denominations to be mainline:[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives has difficulties collecting data on traditionally African American denominations. Those churches most likely to be identified as mainline include these Methodist groups:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catholic Church arrived in what is now the United States during the earliest days of the European colonization of the Americas. At the time the country was founded (meaning the Thirteen Colonies in 1776), only a small fraction of the population there were Catholics (mostly in Maryland); however, as a result of expansion and immigration over the country's history, the number of adherents has grown dramatically and it is the largest profession of faith in the United States today. With over 67?million registered residents professing the faith in 2008, the United States has the fourth largest Catholic population in the world after Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Church's leadership body in the United States is the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, made up of the hierarchy of bishops and archbishops of the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands, although each bishop is independent in his own diocese, answerable only to the Pope.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo primate for Catholics exists in the United States. The Archdiocese of Baltimore has Prerogative of Place, which confers to its archbishop a subset of the leadership responsibilities granted to primates in other countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of Catholics grew from the early 19th century through immigration and the acquisition of the predominantly Catholic former possessions of France, Spain, and Mexico, followed in the mid-19th century by a rapid influx of Irish, German, Italian and Polish immigrants from Europe, making Catholicism the largest Christian denomination in the United States. This increase was met by widespread prejudice and hostility, often resulting in riots and the burning of churches, convents, and seminaries.[61] The integration of Catholics into American society was marked by the election of John F. Kennedy as President in 1960. Since then, the percentage of Americans who are Catholic has remained at around 25%.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities in 2011, there are approximately 230 Roman Catholic universities and colleges in the United States with nearly 1 million students and some 65,000 professors.[63] Catholic schools educate 2.7 million students in the United States, employing 150,000 teachers. In 2002, Catholic health care systems, overseeing 625 hospitals with a combined revenue of 30 billion dollars, comprised the nation's largest group of nonprofit systems.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nGroups of immigrants from several different regions, mainly Eastern Europe and the Middle East, brought Eastern Orthodoxy to the United States.[65] This traditional branch of Eastern Christianity has since spread beyond the boundaries of ethnic immigrant communities and now include multi-ethnic membership and parishes. There are several Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical jurisdictions in the USA, organized within the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America.[66] Statistically, Eastern Orthodox Christians are among the wealthiest Christians denomination in the United States,[35] and they also tend to be better educated than most other religious groups in America, in the sense that they have a high number of graduate (68%) and post-graduate degrees (28%) per capita.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral groups of Christian immigrants, mainly from the Middle East, Caucasus, Africa and India, brought Oriental Orthodoxy to the United States.[67] This ancient branch of Eastern Christianity includes several ecclesiastical jurisdictions in the USA, like Armenian Apostolic Church in the United States,[68] and Coptic Orthodox Church in the United States.[69] There are also dioceses of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and Syriac Orthodox Church,[70] including Malankara Archdiocese of North America. Also, there are dioceses of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in the USA (Malankara Orthodox Diocese of Northeast America and Malankara Orthodox Diocese of Southwest America).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is a nontrinitarian restorationist denomination. The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, and is the largest originating from the Latter Day Saint movement which was founded by Joseph Smith in Upstate New York in 1830. It forms the majority in Utah, the plurality in Idaho, and high percentages in Nevada, Arizona, and Wyoming; in addition to sizable numbers in Colorado, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Hawaii and California. Current U.S. membership is 6.6 million.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, around 13-14% of Mormons lived in Utah, the center of cultural influence for Mormonism.[72] Utah Mormons (as well as Mormons living in the Intermountain West) are on average more culturally and politically conservative and Libertarian than those living in some cosmopolitan centers elsewhere in the U.S.[73] Utahns self-identifying as Mormon also attend church somewhat more on average than Mormons living in other states. (Nonetheless, whether they live in Utah or elsewhere in the U.S., Mormons tend to be more culturally and politically conservative than members of other U.S. religious groups.)[74] Utah Mormons often place a greater emphasis on pioneer heritage than international Mormons who generally are not descendants of the Mormon pioneers.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunity of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) is a trinitarian restorationist denomination based in Independence, Missouri at the theologically significant Temple Lot. Community of Christ is the second largest denomination in the Latter-day Saint movement with 130,000 members in the United States and 250,000 worldwide (See Community of Christ membership statistics). The church owns many of the early LDS historic sites including the Kirtland Temple near Cleveland, Ohio and the Joseph Smith properties in Nauvoo, Illinois. Community of Christ has taken an ecumenical and progressive approach recent years including joining the National Council of Churches, ordaining women to the church's priesthood since 1984, and more recently approving the blessing of same-sex marriages.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall churches within the Latter-day Saint movement include Church of Christ (Temple Lot), Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Restoration Branches, and Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristianity was introduced during the period of European colonization. The Spanish and French brought Catholicism to the colonies of New Spain and New France respectively, while British and Germans introduced Protestantism. Among Protestants, adherents to Anglicanism, the Baptist Church, Congregationalism, Presbyterianism, Lutheranism, Quakerism, Mennonite and Moravian Church were the first to settle in the American colonies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch founded their colony of New Netherland in 1624;[76] they established the Dutch Reformed Church as the colony's official religion in 1628.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpain established missions and towns in what are now Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Florida, and California. Many cities and towns still retain in the present day the names of the Catholic saints these missions were named for; an excellent example of this is  the full  legal name of the city of Los Angeles: El Pueblo de Nuestra Se?ora Reina de Los ngeles del Ro Porci~ncula, or The Town of Our Lady, Queen of the Angels of the Porciuncula River.  The city was founded by Franciscan friars, who named their tiny church and later the town that formed around it after the Virgin Mary, also known to Catholics as Our Lady, Queen of the Angels.  Similar patterns emerged wherever the Spanish went, such as San Antonio, Texas, (named for Anthony of Padua, Santa Fe, New Mexico (named after Francis of Assisi,) and Saint Augustine, Florida, (named for Augustine of Hippo), as was Saint Lucy County and Port Saint Lucy in Florida named for Saint Lucy/Santa Lucia although Saint Petersburg, Florida was not named for St. Peter, but for the city of the same name in Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the English colonies, Catholicism was introduced with the settling of Maryland.\\r\\n\\r\\nConversion of Native Americans to Catholicism was a main goal of the Catholic missionaries, especially the Jesuits. This was common in places where French influence was strong, like Detroit or Louisiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the British North American colonies that eventually formed the United States of America were settled in the 17th century by men and women, who, in the face of European religious persecution, refused to compromise passionately-held religious convictions and fled Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nA group which later became known as the Pilgrims settled the Plymouth Colony in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620, seeking refuge from persecution in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Puritans, a much larger group than the Pilgrims, established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 with 400 settlers. Puritans were English Protestants who wished to reform and purify the Church of England in the New World of what they considered to be unacceptable residues of Catholicism. Within two years, an additional 2,000 settlers arrived. From 1620 to 1640 Puritans emigrated to New England from England to escape persecution and gain the liberty to worship as they chose independently of the Church of England, England being on the verge of the English Civil War. Most settled in New England, but some went as far as the West Indies. Theologically, the Puritans were \\"non-separating Congregationalists.\\" The Puritans created a deeply religious, socially tight-knit and politically innovative culture that is still present in the modern United States. They hoped this new land would serve as a \\"redeemer nation.\\"[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Church of England was legally established in the colony in 1619; 22 Anglican clergymen arrived by 1624. In practice, \\"establishment\\" meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, in addition to the salary of the minister. There never was a bishop in colonial Virginia; the local vestry consisted of laymen controlled the parish.[79] The colonists were typically inattentive, uninterested, and bored during church services, according to the ministers, who complained that the people were sleeping, whispering, ogling the fashionably dressed women, walking about and coming and going, or at best looking out the windows or staring blankly into space.[80] There were too few ministers for the widely scattered population, so ministers encouraged parishioners to become devout at home, using the Book of Common Prayer for private prayer and devotion (rather than the Bible). The stress on personal piety opened the way for the First Great Awakening, which pulled people away from the established church and into the unauthorized Baptist and Methodist movements.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoger Williams, who preached religious tolerance, separation of church and state, and a complete break with the Church of England, was banished from Massachusetts and founded Rhode Island Colony, which became a haven for other religious refugees from the Puritan community. Some migrants who came to Colonial America were in search of the freedom to practice forms of Christianity which were prohibited and persecuted in Europe. Since there was no state religion, and since Protestantism had no central authority, religious practice in the colonies became diverse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Quakers formed in England in 1652, where they were severely persecuted in England for daring to deviate so far from orthodox Anglican Christianity. Many sought refuge in New Jersey, Rhode Island and especially Pennsylvania, which was owned by William Penn, a rich Quaker. The Quakers kept political control until Indian wars broke out; the Quakers were pacifists and gave up control to groups that were eager to fight the Indians.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1683 many German-speaking immigrants arrived in Pennsylvania from the Rhine Valley and Switzerland. Starting in the 1730s Count Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren sought to minister to these immigrants while they also began missions among the Native American tribes of New York and Pennsylvania. Heinrich Melchior Muehlenberg organized the first Lutheran Synod in Pennsylvania in the 1740s.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nCatholic fortunes fluctuated in Maryland during the rest of the 17th century, as they became an increasingly smaller minority of the population. After the Glorious Revolution of 1689 in England, penal laws deprived Catholics of the right to vote, hold office, educate their children or worship publicly. Until the American Revolution, Catholics in Maryland, like Charles Carroll of Carrollton, were dissenters in their own country but keeping loyal to their convictions. At the time of the Revolution, Catholics formed less than 1% of the population of the thirteen colonies, in 2007, Catholics comprised 24% of US population.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvangelicalism is difficult to date and to define. Scholars have argued that, as a self-conscious movement, evangelicalism did not arise until the mid-17th century, perhaps not until the Great Awakening itself. The fundamental premise of evangelicalism is the conversion of individuals from a state of sin to a \\"new birth\\" through the preaching of the Word. The Great Awakening refers to a northeastern Protestant revival movement that took place in the 1730s and 1740s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first generation of New England Puritans required that church members undergo a conversion experience that they could describe publicly. Their successors were not as successful in reaping harvests of redeemed souls. The movement began with Jonathan Edwards, a Massachusetts preacher who sought to return to the Pilgrims' strict Calvinist roots. British preacher George Whitefield and other itinerant preachers continued the movement, traveling across the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style. Followers of Edwards and other preachers of similar religiosity called themselves the \\"New Lights,\\" as contrasted with the \\"Old Lights,\\" who disapproved of their movement. To promote their viewpoints, the two sides established academies and colleges, including Princeton and Williams College. The Great Awakening has been called the first truly American event.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supporters of the Awakening and its evangelical thrustPresbyterians, Baptists, and Methodistsbecame the largest American Protestant denominations by the first decades of the 19th century. By the 1770s, the Baptists were growing rapidly both in the north (where they founded Brown University), and in the South. Opponents of the Awakening or those split by itAnglicans, Quakers, and Congregationalistswere left behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Great Awakening of the 1740s increased religiosity in most of the colonies. By 1780 the percentage of adult colonists who formally held membership in a church was between 10-30%, not counting slaves or Native Americans. North Carolina had the lowest percentage at about 4%, while New Hampshire and South Carolina were tied for the highest, at about 16%. Many others informally associated with the churches.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Revolution split some denominations, notably the Church of England, most of whose ministers supported the king. The Quakers and some German sects were pacifists and remained neutral. Religious practice suffered in certain places because of the absence of ministers and the destruction of churches, but in other areas, religion flourished.\\r\\n\\r\\nBadly hurt, the Anglicans reorganized after the war. It became the Protestant Episcopal Church.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1794, the Russian Orthodox missionary St. Herman of Alaska arrived on Kodiak island in Alaska and began significantly evangelizing the native peoples. Nearly all the Russians left in 1867 when the U.S. purchased Alaska, but the Eastern Orthodox faith remained.\\r\\n\\r\\nLambert (2003) has examined the religious affiliations and beliefs of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, 49 were Protestants, and two were Catholics (D. Carroll, and Fitzsimons).[86]  Among the Protestant delegates to the Constitutional Convention, 28 were Church of England (or Episcopalian, after the American Revolutionary War was won), eight were Presbyterians, seven were Congregationalists, two were Lutherans, two were Dutch Reformed, and two were Methodists.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter independence, the American states were obliged to write constitutions establishing how each would be governed. For three years, from 1778 to 1780, the political energies of Massachusetts were absorbed in drafting a charter of government that the voters would accept. One of the most contentious issues was whether the state would support the church financially. Advocating such a policy were the ministers and most members of the Congregational Church, which received public financial support, during the colonial period. The Baptists tenaciously adhered to their ancient conviction that churches should receive no support from the state[citation needed]. The Constitutional Convention chose to support the church and Article Three authorized a general religious tax to be directed to the church of a taxpayers' choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch tax laws also took effect in Connecticut and New Hampshire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1801, members of the Danbury Baptists Associations wrote a letter to the new President-elect Thomas Jefferson. Baptists, being a minority in Connecticut, were still required to pay fees to support the Congregationalist majority. The Baptists found this intolerable. The Baptists, well aware of Jefferson's own unorthodox beliefs, sought him as an ally in making all religious expression a fundamental human right and not a matter of government largesse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his January 1, 1802, reply to the Danbury Baptist Association Jefferson summed up the First Amendment's original intent, and used for the first time anywhere a now-familiar phrase in today's political and judicial circles: the amendment established a \\"wall of separation between church and state.\\" Largely unknown in its day, this phrase has since become a major Constitutional issue. The first time the U.S. Supreme Court cited that phrase from Jefferson was in 1878, 76?years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second Great Awakening was a Protestant movement that began around 1790, gained momentum by 1800, and after 1820 membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the 1840s. It was a reaction against skepticism, deism, and rational Christianity, and was especially attractive to young women.[87] Millions of new members enrolled in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age. The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Second Great Awakening, new Protestant denominations emerged such as Adventism, the Restoration Movement, and groups such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormonism. While the First Great Awakening was centered on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, the Second focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal innovation produced by the revivals was the camp meeting. When assembled in a field or at the edge of a forest for a prolonged religious meeting, the participants transformed the site into a camp meeting. Singing and preaching were the main activities for several days. The revivals were often intense and created intense emotions. Some fell away but many if not most became permanent church members. The Methodists and Baptists made them one of the evangelical signatures of the denomination.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Christianity of the black population was grounded in evangelicalism. The Second Great Awakening has been called the \\"central and defining event in the development of Afro-Christianity.\\" During these revivals Baptists and Methodists converted large numbers of blacks. However, many were disappointed at the treatment they received from their fellow believers and at the backsliding in the commitment to abolish slavery that many white Baptists and Methodists had advocated immediately after the American Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen their discontent could not be contained, forceful black leaders followed what was becoming an American habitthey formed new denominations. In 1787, Richard Allen and his colleagues in Philadelphia broke away from the Methodist Church and in 1815 founded the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Civil War, Black Baptists desiring to practice Christianity away from racial discrimination, rapidly set up several separate state Baptist conventions. In 1866, black Baptists of the South and West combined to form the Consolidated American Baptist Convention. This convention eventually collapsed but three national conventions formed in response. In 1895 the three conventions merged to create the National Baptist Convention. It is now the largest African-American religious organization in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"secularization of society\\" is attributed to the time of the Enlightenment. In the United States, religious observance is much higher than in Europe, and the United States' culture leans conservative in comparison to other western nations, in part due to the Christian element.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiberal Christianity, exemplified by some theologians, sought to bring to churches new critical approaches to the Bible. Sometimes called \\"liberal theology\\", liberal Christianity is an umbrella term covering movements and ideas within 19th- and 20th-century Christianity. New attitudes became evident, and the practice of questioning the nearly universally accepted Christian orthodoxy began to come to the forefront.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the postÿWorld War I era, liberalism was the faster-growing sector of the American church. Liberal wings of denominations were on the rise, and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well. In the postÿWorld War II era, the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America's seminaries and church structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1850 Catholics had become the country's largest single denomination. Between 1860 and 1890 the population of Catholics in the United States tripled through immigration; by the end of the decade, it would reach seven million. These huge numbers of immigrant Catholics came from Ireland, Quebec, Southern Germany, Italy, Poland and Eastern Europe. This influx would eventually bring increased political power for the Catholic Church and a greater cultural presence led at the same time to a growing fear of the Catholic \\"menace.\\" As the 19th century wore on animosity waned, Protestant Americans realized that Catholics were not trying to seize control of the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristian fundamentalism began as a movement in the late 19th century and early 20th century to reject influences of secular humanism and source criticism in modern Christianity. In reaction to liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to these conservative groups, they sought to establish tenets necessary to maintaining a Christian identity, the \\"fundamentals,\\" hence the term fundamentalist.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, the movement divided, with the label Fundamentalist being retained by the smaller and more hard-line group(s). Evangelical has become the main identifier of the groups holding to the movement's moderate and earliest ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S. and elsewhere in the world, there has been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of Protestant denominations, especially those that are more exclusively evangelical, and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1950s saw a boom in the Evangelical church in America. The postÿWorld War II prosperity experienced in the U.S. also had its effects on the church. Church buildings were erected in large numbers, and the Evangelical church's activities grew along with this expansive physical growth. In the southern U.S., the Evangelicals, represented by leaders such as Billy Graham, have experienced a notable surge displacing the caricature of the pulpit pounding country preachers of fundamentalism.[citation needed] The stereotypes have gradually shifted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Evangelical community worldwide is diverse, the ties that bind all Evangelicals are still apparent: a \\"high view\\" of Scripture, belief in the Deity of Christ, the Trinity, salvation by grace through faith, and the bodily resurrection of Christ.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Federal Council of Churches, founded in 1908, marked the first major expression of a growing modern ecumenical movement among Christians in the United States. It was active in pressing for reform of public and private policies, particularly as they impacted the lives of those living in poverty, and developed a comprehensive and widely debated Social Creed which served as a humanitarian \\"bill of rights\\" for those seeking improvements in American life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1950, the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA (usually identified as National Council of Churches, or NCC) represented a dramatic expansion in the development of ecumenical cooperation. It was a merger of the Federal Council of Churches, the International Council of Religious Education, and several other interchurch ministries. Today, the NCC is a joint venture of 35 Christian denominations in the United States with 100,000 local congregations and 45,000,000 adherents. Its member communions include Mainline Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, African-American, Evangelical and historic Peace churches. The NCC took a prominent role in the Civil Rights movement and fostered the publication of the widely used Revised Standard Version of the Bible, followed by an updated New Revised Standard Version, the first translation to benefit from the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The organization is headquartered in New York City, with a public policy office in Washington, DC. The NCC is related fraternally to hundreds of local and regional councils of churches, to other national councils across the globe, and to the World Council of Churches. All of these bodies are independently governed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarl McIntire led in organizing the American Council of Christian Churches (ACCC), now with 7 member bodies, in September 1941. It was a more militant and fundamentalist organization set up in opposition to what became the National Council of Churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Association of Evangelicals for United Action was formed in St. Louis, Missouri on April 7ÿ9, 1942. It soon shortened its name to the National Association of Evangelicals (NEA). There are currently 60 denominations with about 45,000 churches in the organization. The NEA is related fraternally the World Evangelical Fellowship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, 39 communions and 7 Christian organizations officially launched Christian Churches Together in the USA (CCT). CCT provides a space that is inclusive of the diversity of Christian traditions in the United StatesEvangelical/Pentecostal, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Catholic, historic Protestant, and historic Black churches. CCT is characterized by its emphasis on relationships and prayer. Every year these communions and organizations meet over four days to discuss critical social issues, pray and strengthen their relationships.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother noteworthy development in 20th-century Christianity was the rise of the modern Pentecostal movement. Pentecostalism, which had its roots in the Pietism and the Holiness movement, many will cite that it arose out of the meetings in 1906 at an urban mission on Azusa Street in Los Angeles, but it actually started in 1900 in Topeka, Kansas with a group led by Charles Parham and the Bethel Bible School <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fox_Parham> From there it spread by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there.\\r\\n\\r\\nPentecostalism would later birth the Charismatic movement within already established denominations, and it continues to be an important force in Western Christianity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, approximately one-sixth of the population of the United States was Catholic. Modern Catholic immigrants come to the United States from the Philippines, Poland, and Latin America, especially from Mexico. This multiculturalism and diversity have greatly impacted the flavor of Catholicism in the United States. For example, many dioceses serve in both the English language and the Spanish language.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile children and youth in the colonial era were treated as small adults, awareness of their special status and needs grew in the nineteenth century, as one after another the denominations large and small began special programs for their young people. Protestant theologian Horace Bushnell in Christian Nurture (1847) emphasized the necessity of identifying and supporting the religiosity of children and young adults. Beginning in the 1790s the Protestant denominations set up Sunday school programs. They provided a major source of new members.[91] Urban Protestant churchmen set up the interdenominational YMCA (and later the YWCA) programs in cities from the 1850s.[92] Methodists looked on their youth as potential political activists, providing them with opportunities to engage in social justice movements such as prohibition. Black Protestants, especially after they could form their own separate churches, integrated their young people directly into the larger religious community. Their youth played a major role in the leadership of the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and the 1960s. White evangelicals in the twentieth century set up Bible clubs for teenagers and experimented with the use of music to attract young people. The Catholics set up an entire network of parochial schools, and by the late nineteenth century probably more than half of their young members were attending elementary schools run by local parishes.[93] Some Missouri Synod German Lutherans and Dutch Reformed churches also set up parochial schools. In the twentieth century, all the denominations sponsored programs such as the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baylor University Institute for Studies of Religion conducted a survey covering various aspects of American religious life.[96] The researchers analyzing the survey results have categorized the responses into what they call the \\"four Gods\\": An authoritarian God (31%), a benevolent God (25%), a distant God (23%), and a critical God (16%).[96] A major implication to emerge from this survey is that \\"the type of god people believe in can predict their political and moral attitudes more so than just looking at their religious tradition.\\"[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as religious tradition, the survey determined that 33.6% of respondents are evangelical Protestants, while 10.8% had no religious affiliation at all. Out of those without affiliation, 62.9% still indicated that they \\"believe in God or some higher power\\".[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother study, conducted by Christianity Today with Leadership magazine, attempted to understand the range and differences among American Christians. A national attitudinal and behavioral survey found that their beliefs and practices clustered into five distinct segments. Spiritual growth for two large segments of Christians may be occurring in non-traditional ways. Instead of attending church on Sunday mornings, many opt for personal, individual ways to stretch themselves spiritually.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nGallup International indicates that 41%[98] of American citizens report they regularly attend religious services, compared to 15% of French citizens, 10% of UK citizens,[99] and 7.5% of Australian citizens.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nChurch attendance varies significantly by state and region. In a 2014 Gallup survey, less than half of Americans said that they attended church or synagogue weekly. The figures ranged from 51% in Utah to 17% in Vermont.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nData from the Pew Research Center show that as of 2008, the majority of White Americans were Christian, and about 51% of the White American were Protestant, and 26% were Catholic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most methodologically rigorous study of Hispanic and Latino Americans religious affiliation to date was the Hispanic Churches in American Public Life (HCAPL) National Survey, conducted between August and October 2000. This survey found that 70% of all Hispanic and Latino Americans are Catholic, 20% are Protestant, 3% are \\"alternative Christians\\" (such as Mormon or Jehovah's Witnesses).[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of African Americans are Protestant (78%), many of whom follow the historically black churches.[103][104] A 2012 Pew Research Center study found that 42% of the Asian Americans identify themselves as Christians.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning around 1600, European settlers introduced Anglican and Puritan religion, as well as Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Quaker, and Moravian denominations.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the 16th century, the Spanish (and later the French and English) introduced Catholicism. From the 19th century to the present, Catholics came to the US in large numbers due to the immigration of Italians, Hispanics, Portuguese, French, Polish, Irish, Highland Scots, Dutch, Flemish, Hungarians, Germans, Lebanese (Maronite), and other ethnic groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the Eastern Orthodox adherents in the United States are descended from immigrants of Eastern European or Middle Eastern background, especially from Greek, Russian, Ukrainian, Arab, Bulgarian, Romanian, or Serbian backgrounds.[65][107]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the Oriental Orthodox adherents in the United States are from Armenian, Coptic and Ethiopian backgrounds.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the traditional Church of the East adherents in the United States are from Assyrian background.\\r\\n\\r\\nData from the Pew Research Center show that as of 2013, there were about 1.6 million Christians from Jewish background, most of them Protestant.[108][109][110] According to the same data, most of the Christians of Jewish descent were raised as Jews or are Jews by ancestry.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study from 2015 estimated some 450,000 American Muslims who had converted to Christianity, most of whom belong to an evangelical or Pentecostal community.[31] In 2010 there were approximately 180,000 Arab-Americans and about 130,000 Iranian Americans who converted from Islam to Christianity. Dudley Woodbury, a Fulbright scholar of Islam, estimates that 20,000 Muslims convert to Christianity annually in the United States.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's been also reported that conversion into Christianity is significantly increasing among Korean Americans,[112] Chinese Americans,[113] and Japanese Americans.[114] By 2012, the percentage of Christians within the mentioned communities was 71%,[115] more than 30%[116] and 37%.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nMessianic Judaism (or Messianic Movement) is the name of a Christian movement comprising a number of streams, whose members may consider themselves Jewish.[118] It blends elements of religious Jewish practice with evangelical Christianity. Messianic Judaism affirms Christian creeds such as the messiahship and divinity of \\"Yeshua\\" (the Hebrew name of Jesus) and the Triune Nature of God, while also adhering to some Jewish dietary laws and customs. As of  2012[update], population estimates for the United States were between 175,000 and 250,000 members.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis table lists total membership and number of congregations in the United States for religious bodies with more than 1 million members.

Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained.[4] Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters, run with single cars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest roller coasters are believed to have originated from the so-called \\"Russian Mountains\\", specially constructed hills of ice located in the area that is now St. Petersburg.[5] Built in the 17th century, the slides were built to a height of between 21 and 24?m (70 and 80 feet), had a 50-degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports. Later, in 1784, Catherine the Great is said to have constructed a sledding hill in the gardens of her palace at Oranienbaum in St. Petersburg. [6] The name Russian Mountains to designate a roller coaster is preserved in many languages (e.g. the Spanish monta?a rusa), but the Russian term for roller coasters is ҿҿ ̾ѿ (\\"amerikanskiye gorki\\"), meaning \\"American mountains.\\"\\r\\nThe first modern roller coaster, the Promenades Aeriennes, opened in Parc Beaujon in Paris on July 8, 1817. [7] It featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds.[8] It spawned half a dozen imitators, but their popularity soon declined.\\r\\nHowever, during the Belle Epoque they returned to fashion. In 1887 French entrepreneur Joseph Oller, co-founder of the Moulin Rouge music hall, constructed the Montagnes Russes de Belleville, \\"Russian Mountains of Belleville\\" with two hundred meters of track laid out in a double-eight, later enlarged to four figure-eight-shaped loops.[9]\\r\\nIn 1827, a mining company in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania constructed the Mauch Chunk gravity railroad, a 8.7-mile (14.0?km) downhill track used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk (now known as Jim Thorpe), Pennsylvania.[10] By the 1850s, the \\"Gravity Road\\" (as it became known) was selling rides to thrill seekers. Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.\\r\\nUsing this idea as a basis, LaMarcus Adna Thompson began work on a gravity Switchback Railway that opened at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York in 1884.[11] Passengers climbed to the top of a platform and rode a bench-like car down the 600-foot (180?m) track up to the top of another tower where the vehicle was switched to a return track and the passengers took the return trip.[12] This track design was soon replaced with an oval complete circuit.[8] In 1885, Phillip Hinkle introduced the first full-circuit coaster with a lift hill, the Gravity Pleasure Road, which became the most popular attraction at Coney Island.[8] Not to be outdone, in 1886 Thompson patented his design of roller coaster that included dark tunnels with painted scenery. \\"Scenic Railways\\" were soon found in amusement parks across the county.[8]\\r\\nBy 1919, the first underfriction roller coaster had been developed by John Miller.[13] Soon, roller coasters spread to amusement parks all around the world. Perhaps the best known historical roller coaster, Cyclone, was opened at Coney Island in 1927.\\r\\nThe Great Depression marked the end of the golden age of roller coasters, and theme parks in general went into decline. This lasted until 1972, when the instant success of The Racer at Kings Island near Cincinnati began a roller coaster renaissance which has continued to this day.\\r\\nIn 1959, Disneyland introduced a design breakthrough with Matterhorn Bobsleds, the first roller coaster to use a tubular steel track. Unlike wooden coaster rails, tubular steel can be bent in any direction, allowing designers to incorporate loops, corkscrews, and many other maneuvers into their designs. Most modern roller coasters are made of steel, although wooden coasters and hybrids are still being built.\\r\\nThere are several explanations of the name roller coaster. It is said to have originated from an early American design where slides or ramps were fitted with rollers over which a sled would coast.[8] This design was abandoned in favor of fitting the wheels to the sled or other vehicles, but the name endured.\\r\\nAnother explanation is that it originated from a ride located in a roller skating rink in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1887. A toboggan-like sled was raised to the top of a track which consisted of hundreds of rollers. This Roller Toboggan then took off down gently rolling hills to the floor. The inventors of this ride, Stephen E. Jackman and Byron B. Floyd, claim that they were the first to use the term \\"roller coaster\\".[12]\\r\\nThe term jet coaster is used for roller coasters in Japan, where such amusement park rides are very popular.[14]\\r\\nIn many languages, the name refers to \\"Russian mountains\\". Contrastingly, in Russian, they are called \\"American mountains\\". In Scandinavian languages, the roller coaster is referred as \\"mountain-and-valley railway\\".\\r\\nThe cars on a typical roller coaster are not self-powered. Instead, a standard full circuit coaster is pulled up with a chain or cable along the lift hill to the first peak of the coaster track. The potential energy accumulated by the rise in height is transferred to kinetic energy as the cars race down the first downward slope. Kinetic energy is then converted back into potential energy as the train moves up again to the second peak. This hill is necessarily lower, as some mechanical energy is lost to friction.\\r\\nNot all rides feature a lift hill, however. The train may be set into motion by a launch mechanism such as a flywheel launch, linear induction motors, linear synchronous motors, hydraulic launch, compressed air launch or drive tire. Such launched coasters are capable of reaching higher speeds in a shorter length of track than those featuring a conventional lift hill. Some roller coasters move back and forth along the same section of track; these are known as shuttles and usually run the circuit once with riders moving forwards and then backwards through the same course.\\r\\nA properly designed ride under good conditions will have enough kinetic, or moving, energy to complete the entire course, at the end of which brakes bring the train to a complete stop and it is pushed into the station. A brake run at the end of the circuit is the most common method of bringing the roller coaster ride to a stop. One notable exception is a powered roller coaster. These rides, instead of being powered by gravity, use one or more motors in the cars to propel the trains along the course.\\r\\nIf a continuous-circuit coaster does not have enough kinetic energy to completely travel the course after descending from its highest point (as can happen with high winds or increased friction), the train can valley: that is, roll backwards and forwards along the track, until all kinetic energy has been released. The train will then come to a complete stop in the middle of the track. This, however, works somewhat differently on a launched coaster. When a train launcher does not have enough potential energy to launch the train to the top of an incline, the train is said to roll back.\\r\\nIn 2006, NASA announced that it would build a system using principles similar to those of a roller coaster to help astronauts escape the Ares I launch pad in an emergency[15], although this has since been scrapped along with the rest of the Ares program.\\r\\nMany safety systems are implemented in roller coasters. One of these is the block system. Most large roller coasters have the ability to run two or more trains at once, and the block system prevents these trains from colliding. In this system, the track is divided into several sections, or blocks. Only one train at a time is permitted in each block. At the end of each block, there is a section of track where a train can be stopped if necessary (either by preventing dispatch from the station, closing brakes, or stopping a lift). Sensors at the end of each block detect when a train passes so that the computer running the ride is aware of which blocks are occupied. When the computer detects a train about to travel into an already occupied block, it uses whatever method is available to keep it from entering. The trains are fully automated.\\r\\nThe above can cause a cascade effect when multiple trains become stopped at the end of each block. In order to prevent this problem, ride operators follow set procedures regarding when to release a newly loaded train from the station. One common pattern, used on rides with two trains, is to do the following: hold train #1 (which has just finished the ride) right outside the station, release train #2 (which has loaded while #1 was running), and then allow #1 into the station to unload safely.\\r\\nAnother key to safety is the control of the roller coaster's operating computers: programmable logic controllers (often called PLCs). A PLC detects faults associated with the mechanism and makes decisions to operate roller coaster elements (e.g. lift, track-switches and brakes) based on configured state and operator actions. Periodic maintenance and inspection are required to verify structures and materials are within expected wear tolerances and are in sound working order. Sound operating procedures are also a key to safety.\\r\\nRoller coaster design requires a working knowledge of basic physics to avoid uncomfortable, even potentially fatal, strain to the rider. Ride designers must carefully ensure the accelerations experienced throughout the ride do not subject the human body to more than it can handle. The human body needs time to detect changes in force in order to control muscle tension. Failure to take this into account can result in severe injuries such as whiplash. The accelerations accepted in roller coaster design are generally in the 4-6Gs (40ÿ60 m s?2) range for positive vertical (pushing you into your seat), and 1.5-2Gs (15ÿ20 m s?2) for the negative vertical (flying out of your seat as you crest a hill).[citation needed] This range safely ensures the majority of the population experiences no harmful side effects. Lateral accelerations are generally kept to a minimum by banking curves. The neck's inability to deal with high forces leads to lateral accelerations generally limited to under 1.8Gs.[citation needed] Sudden accelerations in the lateral plane result in a rough ride.\\r\\nDespite safety measures, accidents can, and do, occur.[16] Regulations concerning accident reporting vary from one authority to another. Thus in the US, California requires amusement parks to report any ride-related accident that requires an emergency room visit, while Florida exempts parks whose parent companies employ more than 1000 people from having to report any accidents at all.[citation needed] Rep. Ed Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation that would give oversight of rides to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).[citation needed]\\r\\nRide accidents can also be caused by riders themselves or ride operators not following safety directions properly, and, in extremely rare cases, riders can be injured by mechanical failures. In recent years, controversy has arisen about the safety of increasingly extreme rides. There have been suggestions that these may be subjecting passengers to translational and rotational accelerations that may be capable of causing brain injuries. In 2003 the Brain Injury Association of America concluded in a report that \\"There is evidence that roller coaster rides pose a health risk to some people some of the time. Equally evident is that the overwhelming majority of riders will suffer no ill effects.\\"[17]\\r\\nA similar report in 2005 linked roller coasters and other thrill rides with potentially triggering abnormal heart conditions that could lead to death.[18] Autopsies have shown that recent deaths at various Disney parks, Anheuser-Busch parks, and Six Flags parks were due to previously undetected heart ailments.\\r\\nStatistically, roller coasters are very safe compared to other activities. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that 134 park guests required hospitalization in 2001 and that fatalities related to amusement rides average two per year. According to a study commissioned by Six Flags, 319 million people visited parks in 2001. The study concluded that a visitor has a one in one-and-a-half billion chance of being fatally injured, and that the injury rates for children's wagons, golf carts, and folding lawn chairs are higher than for amusement rides.[19]\\r\\nRoller coasters are divided into two main categories: steel roller coasters and wooden roller coasters. Steel coasters have tubular steel tracks, and compared to wooden coasters, they are typically known for offering a smoother ride and their ability to turn riders upside-down. Wooden coasters have flat steel tracks, and are typically renowned for producing \\"air time\\" through the use of negative G-forces when reaching the crest of some hill elements. Newer types of track, such as I-Box and Topper introduced by Rocky Mountain Construction, improve the ride experience on wooden coasters, lower maintenance costs, and add the ability to invert riders.\\r\\nModern roller coasters are constantly evolving to provide a variety of different experiences. More focus is being placed on the position of riders in relation to the overall experience. Traditionally, riders sit facing forward, but newer variations such as stand-up and flying models position the rider in different ways to change the experiences. A flying model, for example, is a suspended roller coaster where the riders lie facing forward and down with their chests and feet strapped in. Other ways of enhancing the experience involve removing the floor beneath passengers riding above the track, as featured in floorless roller coasters. Also new track elements ÿ usually types of inversions ÿ are often introduced to provide entirely new experiences.\\r\\nSeveral height classifications have been used by parks and manufacturers in marketing their roller coasters, as well as enthusiasts within the industry. One classification, the kiddie coaster, is a roller coaster specifically designed for younger riders. Following World War II, parks began pushing for more of them to be built in contrast to the height and age restrictions of standard designs at the time. Companies like Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC) developed scaled-down versions of their larger models to accommodate the demand. These typically featured lift hills smaller than 25 feet (7.6?m), and still do today. The rise of kiddie coasters soon led to the development of \\"junior\\" models that had lift hills up to 45 feet (14?m). A notable example of a junior coaster is the Sea Dragon ÿ the oldest operating roller coaster from PTC's legendary designer John Allen ÿ which opened at Wyandot Lake in 1956 near Powell, Ohio.[12]\\r\\nA hypercoaster, occasionally stylized as hyper coaster, is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least 200 feet (61?m). Moonsault Scramble, which debuted at Fuji-Q Highland in 1984, was the first to break this barrier, though the term hypercoaster was first coined by Cedar Point and Arrow Dynamics with the opening of Magnum XL-200 in 1989.[20][21] Hypercoasters have become one of the most predominant types of roller coasters in the world, now led by manufacturers Bolliger & Mabillard and Intamin.\\r\\nA giga coaster is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least 300 feet (91?m). The term was coined during a partnership between Cedar Point and Intamin on the construction of Millennium Force. Although Morgan and Bolliger & Mabillard have not used the term giga,[22] both have also produced roller coasters in this class.\\r\\nA strata coaster is a type of roller coaster with a height or drop of at least 400 feet (120?m). It was followed by the first full-circuit strata coaster, Top Thrill Dragster, which opened at Cedar Point in 2003 at a height of 420 feet (130?m). Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure is the only other installation in existence, and at 456 feet (139?m), it became the tallest roller coaster in the world when it opened in 2005. Even though Superman: Escape From Krypton is 400 feet (120?m) and opened in 1997, it is generally not considered a Stratacoaster, as it isn't a full circuit ride.[25]\\r\\nRiding Fahrenheit, located at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania.\\r\\nHypersonic XLC, the world's first production Thrust Air 2000 (now defunct)\\r\\nTop Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point is the first strata coaster ever built.\\r\\nRiding Expedition GeForce at Holiday Park, Germany.\\r\\nRaptor, a steel inverted coaster, is located at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio.\\r\\nNew Texas Giant at Six Flags Over Texas before being refurbished into a hybrid steel-wood coaster.\\r\\nLightning Racer at Hersheypark is a racing, dueling roller coaster made by GCI.\\r\\nThis all-wooden roller coaster, built in 1951, dominates the Linnanm?ki amusement park in Helsinki, Finland.\\r\\nConey Island Cyclone in Brooklyn, New York was built in 1927 and refurbished in 1975.\\r\\nSon of Beast in Kings Island was the only wooden coaster to have a vertical loop.

Attracting widespread attention, it was soon followed by other women's rights conventions, including the Rochester Women's Rights Convention in Rochester, New York, two weeks later. In 1850 the first in a series of annual National Women's Rights Conventions met in Worcester, Massachusetts.\\r\\nFemale Quakers local to the area organized the meeting along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was not a Quaker. They planned the event during a visit to the area by Philadelphia-based Lucretia Mott. Mott, a Quaker, was famous for her oratorical ability, which was rare for non-Quaker women during an era in which women were often not allowed to speak in public.\\r\\nThe meeting comprised six sessions including a lecture on law, a humorous presentation, and multiple discussions about the role of women in society. Stanton and the Quaker women presented two prepared documents, the Declaration of Sentiments and an accompanying list of resolutions, to be debated and modified before being put forward for signatures. A heated debate sprang up regarding women's right to vote, with many ÿ including Mott ÿ urging the removal of this concept, but Frederick Douglass, who was the convention's sole African American attendee, argued eloquently for its inclusion, and the suffrage resolution was retained. Exactly 100 of approximately 300 attendees signed the document, mostly women.\\r\\nThe convention was seen by some of its contemporaries, including featured speaker Mott, as one important step among many others in the continuing effort by women to gain for themselves a greater proportion of social, civil and moral rights,[4] while it was viewed by others as a revolutionary beginning to the struggle by women for complete equality with men. Stanton considered the Seneca Falls Convention to be the beginning of the women's rights movement, an opinion that was echoed in the History of Woman Suffrage, which Stanton co-wrote.[4]\\r\\nThe convention's Declaration of Sentiments became \\"the single most important factor in spreading news of the women's rights movement around the country in 1848 and into the future\\", according to Judith Wellman, a historian of the convention.[5] By the time of the National Women's Rights Convention of 1851, the issue of women's right to vote had become a central tenet of the United States women's rights movement.[6] These conventions became annual events until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the decades leading up to 1848, a small number of women began to push against restrictions imposed upon them by society. A few men aided in this effort. In 1831, Reverend Charles Grandison Finney began allowing women to pray aloud in gatherings of men and women.[7] The Second Great Awakening was challenging women's traditional roles in religion. Recalling the era in 1870, Paulina Wright Davis set Finney's decision as the beginning of the American women's reform movement.[7]\\r\\nStarting in 1832, abolitionist and journalist William Lloyd Garrison organized anti-slavery associations which encouraged the full participation of women. Garrison's ideas were not welcomed by a majority of other abolitionists, and those unwilling to include women split from him to form other abolitionist societies.\\r\\nA few women began to gain fame as writers and speakers on the subject of abolition. In the 1830s, Lydia Maria Child wrote to encourage women to write a will,[8] and Frances Wright wrote books on women's rights and social reform. The Grimk sisters published their views against slavery in the late 1830s, and they began speaking to mixed gatherings of men and women for Garrison's American Anti-Slavery Society, as did Abby Kelley. Although these women lectured primarily on the evils of slavery, the fact that a woman was speaking in public was itself a noteworthy stand for the cause of women's rights. Ernestine Rose began lecturing in 1836 to groups of women on the subject of the \\"Science of Government\\" which included the enfranchisement of women.[9]\\r\\nIn 1840, at the urging of Garrison and Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton traveled with their husbands and a dozen other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention, with the expectation that a motion put forward by Phillips to include women's participation in the convention would be controversial. In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage, and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns. In 1842 Thomas M'Clintock and his wife Mary Ann became founding members of the Western New York Anti-Slavery Society and helped write its constitution. When he moved to Rochester in 1847, Frederick Douglass joined Amy and Isaac Post and the M'Clintocks in this Rochester-based chapter of the American Anti-Slavery Society.[10]\\r\\nIn 1839 in Boston, Margaret Fuller began hosting conversations, akin to French salons, among women interested in discussing the \\"great questions\\" facing their sex.[11] Sophia Ripley was one of the participants. In 1845, Fuller published The Great Lawsuit, asking women to claim themselves as self-dependent.\\r\\nIn the 1840s, women in America were reaching out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation.[12] State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work.[12] In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 as an attempt to find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.[13]\\r\\nIn the fall of 1841, Elizabeth Cady Stanton gave her first public speech, on the subject of the Temperance movement, in front of 100 women in Seneca Falls. She wrote to her friend Elizabeth J. Neal that she moved both the audience and herself to tears, saying \\"I infused into my speech an Homeopathic dose of woman's rights, as I take good care to do in many private conversations.\\"[14]\\r\\nLucretia Mott met with Elizabeth Cady Stanton in Boston in 1842, and discussed again the possibility of a woman's rights convention.[10] They talked once more in 1847, prior to Stanton moving from Boston to Seneca Falls.[15]\\r\\nWomen's groups led by Lucretia Mott and Paulina Wright Davis held public meetings in Philadelphia beginning in 1846.[7] A wide circle of abolitionists friendly to women's rights began in 1847 to discuss the possibility of holding a convention wholly devoted to women's rights.[7] In October 1847, Lucy Stone gave her first public speech on the subject of women's rights, entitled The Province of Women, at her brother Bowman Stone's church in Gardner, Massachusetts.[16]\\r\\nIn March 1848, Garrison, the Motts, Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Symonds Foster and others hosted an Anti-Sabbath meeting in Boston, to work toward the elimination of laws that apply only to Sunday, and to gain for the laborer more time away from toil than just one day of rest per week. Lucretia Mott and two other women were active within the executive committee,[17] and Mott spoke to the assemblage. Lucretia Mott raised questions about the validity of blindly following religious and social tradition.[18]\\r\\nOn April 7, 1848, in response to a citizen's petition, the New York State Assembly passed the Married Woman's Property Act, giving women the right to retain property they brought into a marriage, as well as property they acquired during the marriage. Creditors could not seize a wife's property to pay a husband's debts.[19] Leading up to the passage of this law, in 1846, supporters issued a pamphlet, probably authored by Judge John Fine,[20] which relied on its readers' familiarity with the United States Declaration of Independence to demand \\"That all are created free and equal?...\\",[20] and that this idea should apply equally to the sexes. \\"Women, as well as men, are entitled to the full enjoyment of its practical blessings\\".[20] A group of 44?married women of western New York wrote to the Assembly in March 1848, saying \\"your Declaration of Independence declares, that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. And as women have never consented to, been represented in, or recognized by this government, it is evident that in justice no allegiance can be claimed from them?... Our numerous and yearly petitions for this most desirable object having been disregarded, we now ask your august body, to abolish all laws which hold married women more accountable for their acts than infants, idiots, and lunatics.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe General Assembly in Pennsylvania passed a similar married woman's property law a few weeks later, one which Lucretia Mott and others had championed. These progressive state laws were seen by American women as a sign of new hope for women's rights.[19]\\r\\nOn June 2, 1848 in Rochester, New York, Gerrit Smith was nominated as the Liberty Party's presidential candidate.[21] Smith was Elizabeth Cady Stanton's first cousin, and the two enjoyed debating and discussing political and social issues with each other whenever he came to visit.[21] At the National Liberty Convention, held June 14ÿ15 in Buffalo, New York, Smith gave a major address,[22] including in his speech a demand for \\"universal suffrage in its broadest sense, females as well as males being entitled to vote.\\"[21] The delegates approved a passage in their party platform addressing votes for women: \\"Neither here, nor in any other part of the world, is the right of suffrage allowed to extend beyond one of the sexes. This universal exclusion of woman?... argues, conclusively, that, not as yet, is there one nation so far emerged from barbarism, and so far practically Christian, as to permit woman to rise up to the one level of the human family.\\"[21] At this convention, five votes were placed calling for Lucretia Mott to be Smith's vice-presidentthe first time in the United States that a woman was suggested for federal executive office.[21]\\r\\nMany members of the Religious Society of Friends, known as Quakers, made their homes in western New York state, near Seneca Falls. A particularly progressive branch lived in and around Waterloo in Seneca County, New York. These Quakers strove for marital relationships in which men and women worked and lived in equality.[12]\\r\\nThe M'Clintocks came to Waterloo from a Quaker community in Philadelphia. They rented property from Richard P. Hunt, a wealthy Quaker and businessman.[12] The M'Clintock and Hunt families opposed slavery; both participated in the free produce movement, and their houses served as stations on the Underground Railroad.[12]\\r\\nThough women Friends had since the 1660s publicly preached, written and led, and traditional Quaker tenets held that men and women were equals, Quaker women met separately from the men to consider and decide a congregation's business. By the 1840s, some Hicksite Quakers determined to bring women and men together in their business meetings as an expression of their spiritual equality.[12] In June 1848, approximately 200?Hicksites, including the Hunts and the M'Clintocks, formed an even more radical Quaker group, known as the Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends, or Progressive Friends. The Progressive Friends intended to further elevate the influence of women in affairs of the faith. They introduced joint business meetings of men and women, giving women an equal voice.[12]\\r\\nLucretia and James Mott visited central and western New York in the summer of 1848 for a number of reasons, including visiting the Cattaraugus Reservation of the Seneca Nation and former slaves living in the province of Ontario, Canada. Mott was present at the meeting in which the Progressive Friends left the Hicksite Quakers. They also visited Lucretia's sister Martha Coffin Wright in Auburn, NY, where Mott also preached to prisoners at the Auburn State Penitentiary. Lucretia Mott's skill and fame as an orator drew crowds wherever she went.[23]\\r\\nAfter Quaker worship on Sunday July 9, 1848, Lucretia Coffin Mott joined Mary Ann M'Clintock, Martha Coffin Wright (Mott's witty sister, several months pregnant),[24] Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Jane Hunt for tea at the Hunt home in Waterloo. The two eldest M'Clintock daughters, Elizabeth and Mary Ann, Jr. may have accompanied their mother.[25] Jane Hunt had given birth two weeks earlier, and was tending the baby at home. Over tea, Stanton, the only non-Quaker present, vented a lifetime's worth of pent-up frustration, her \\"long-accumulating discontent\\"[26] about women's subservient place in society. The five women decided to hold a women's rights convention in the immediate future, while the Motts were still in the area,[2] and drew up an announcement to run in the Seneca County Courier. The announcement began with these words: \\"WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.A Convention to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of woman\\".[2] The notice specified that only women were invited to the first day's meetings on July 19, but both women and men could attend on the second day to hear Lucretia Mott speak, among others.[2] On July 11, the announcement first appeared, giving readers just eight days' notice until the first day of convention.[27] Other papers such as Douglass's North Star picked up the notice, printing it on July 14.[2] The meeting place was to be the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel[28] in Seneca Falls. Built by a congregation of abolitionists and financed in part by Richard Hunt,[12] the chapel had been the scene of many reform lectures, and was considered the only large building in the area that would open its doors to a women's rights convention.[2]\\r\\nAt their home in Waterloo on Sunday, July 16, the M'Clintocks hosted a smaller planning session for the convention. Mary Ann M'Clintock and her eldest daughters, Elizabeth and Mary Ann, Jr., discussed with Stanton the makeup of the resolutions that would be presented to the convention for approval. Each woman made certain her concerns were appropriately represented among the ten resolutions that they composed.[29] Taken together, the resolutions demanded that women should have equality in the family, education, jobs, religion, and morals.[20] One of the M'Clintock women selected the Declaration of Independence from 1776 as a model for the declaration they wanted to make at their convention. The Declaration of Sentiments was then drafted in the parlor on a round, three-legged, mahogany tea table.[30] Stanton changed a few words of the Declaration of Independence to make it appropriate for a statement by women, replacing \\"The history of the present King of Great Britain\\" with \\"The history of mankind\\" as the basis for \\"usurpations on the part of man toward woman.\\"[31] The women added the phrase \\"and women\\" to make \\"...?all men and women are created equal?...\\"[31] A list of grievances was composed to form the second part of the Declaration.[32]\\r\\nBetween July 16 and July 19, at home on her own writing desk, Stanton edited the grievances and resolutions. Henry Brewster Stanton, a lawyer, politician and Stanton's husband, helped substantiate the document by locating \\"extracts from laws bearing unjustly against woman's property interests.\\"[32] On her own, Stanton added a more radical point to the list of grievances and to the resolutions: the issue of women's voting rights.[33] To the grievances, she added \\"He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise\\", and to the Sentiments, she added a line about man depriving woman of \\"the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation...\\"[33] Stanton then copied the Declaration and resolutions into final draft form for presentation at the meeting. When he saw the addition of woman suffrage, Henry Stanton warned his wife \\"you will turn the proceedings into a farce.\\"[34] He, like most men of his day, was not in favor of women gaining voting rights. Because he intended to run for elective office, he left Seneca Falls to avoid being connected with a convention promoting such an unpopular cause.[35] Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked her sister Harriet Cady Eaton to accompany her; Eaton brought her young son Daniel.[36]\\r\\nOn July 16, Lucretia Mott sent a note to Stanton apologizing in advance for James Mott not being able to attend the first day, as he was feeling \\"quite unwell\\".[37] Lucretia Mott wrote to say she would bring her sister, Martha Wright, and that the two women would participate in both days of the convention.[38]\\r\\nOn July 19, 1848, the morning of the first day of convention, the organizing committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten o'clock on a hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors lockedan overlooked detail.[36] Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.[36]\\r\\nStarting at 11 o'clock, Elizabeth Cady Stanton spoke first, exhorting each woman in the audience to accept responsibility for her own life, and to \\"understand the height, the depth, the length, and the breadth of her own degradation.\\"[36] Lucretia Mott then spoke, encouraging all to take up the cause. Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments in its entirety, then re-read each paragraph so that it could be discussed at length, and changes incorporated. The question of whether men's signatures would be sought for the Declaration was discussed, with the vote looking favorable for including men, but the motion was tabled until the following day when men themselves could participate.[39] The first session adjourned at 2:30?p.m.[40]\\r\\nAfter a pause for refreshment in the 90 heat,[39] an afternoon session began with Stanton and then Mott addressing the audience. The Declaration of Sentiments was read again and more changes were made to it. The resolutions, now numbering eleven with Stanton's addition of women's suffrage, were read aloud and discussed. Lucretia Mott read a humorous newspaper piece written by her sister Martha Wright in which Wright questioned why, after an overworked mother completed the myriad daily tasks that were required of her but not of her husband, she was the one upon whom written advice was \\"so lavishly bestowed.\\"[41] Twenty-seven-year-old Elizabeth W. M'Clintock then delivered a speech, and the first day's business was called to a close.\\r\\nIn the evening, the meeting was opened to all persons, and Lucretia Mott addressed a large audience.[42] She spoke of the progress of other reform movements and so framed for her listeners the social and moral context for the struggle for women's rights. She asked the men present to help women gain the equality they deserved.[41] The editor of the National Reformer, a paper in Auburn, New York, reported that Mott's extemporaneous evening speech was \\"one of the most eloquent, logical, and philosophical discourses which we ever listened to.\\"[42]\\r\\nA larger crowd attended on the second day, including more men. Amelia Bloomer arrived late and took a seat in the upstairs gallery, there being none left in the main seating area. Quaker James Mott was well enough to attend, and he chaired the morning meeting; it was still too radical a concept that a woman serve as chair in front of both men and women.[41]\\r\\nAfter Mott opened the meeting, the minutes of the previous day were read, and Stanton presented the Declaration of Sentiments. In regard to the grievance \\"He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns,\\" Assemblyman Ansel Bascom stood to say that he had recently been at the New York State Assembly which passed the Married Woman's Property Act. Bascom spoke at length about the property rights it secured for married women, including property acquired after marriage.[41] Further discussion of the Declaration ensued, including comments by Frederick Douglass, Thomas and Mary Ann M'Clintock, and Amy Post; the document was adopted unanimously.[43] The question of men's signatures was solved by having two sections of signatures, one for women followed by one for men. One hundred of the 300[44] present signed the Declaration of Sentiments, including 68 women and 32 men.[45] Amelia Bloomer was one of the participants who did not endorse the Declaration; she was focused at that time on the temperance movement.[46] Ansel Bascom was the most conspicuous attendee who chose not to sign the Declaration.[47] The National Reformer reported that those in the audience who evidently regarded the Declaration as \\"too bold and ultra\\", including the lawyers known to be opposed to the equal rights of women, \\"failed to call out any opposition, except in a neighboring BAR-ROOM.\\"[42]\\r\\nAt the afternoon session, the eleven resolutions were read again, and each one was voted on individually. The only one that was materially questioned was the ninth, the one Stanton had added regarding women's right to vote. It read:\\r\\nResolved, that it is the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves their sacred right to the elective franchise.[48]\\r\\nThose who opposed this resolution argued that its presence would cause the other, more rational resolutions to lose support.[49] Others argued that only the social, civil and religious rights of women should be addressed, not the political rights.[34] James and Lucretia Mott were against the resolution; Lucretia said to Stanton, \\"Why Lizzie, thee will make us ridiculous.\\"[34] Stanton defended the concept of woman suffrage, saying women would then be able to affect future legislation and gain further rights.[34] Frederick Douglass, the only African American at the meeting,[50] stood and spoke eloquently in favor; he said that he could not accept the right to vote himself as a black man if woman could not also claim that right. Douglass projected that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere. \\"In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world.\\"[51] Douglass's powerful words rang true with many in attendance, and the resolution passed by a large majority.[43] Lucretia Mott spoke to end the session.[43]\\r\\nQuaker Thomas M'Clintock served as chair for the evening session, opening it at half-past seven.[43] The minutes were read, then Stanton spoke in defense of the many severe accusations brought against the much-abused \\"Lords of Creation.\\"[43] Following Stanton, Thomas M'Clintock read several passages from Sir William Blackstone's laws, to expose for the audience the basis of woman's current legal condition of servitude to man.[52] Lucretia Mott stood to offer another resolution: \\"Resolved, That the speedy success of our cause depends upon the zealous and untiring efforts of both men and women, for the overthrow of the monopoly of the pulpit, and for the securing to woman an equal participation with men in the various trades, professions and commerce.\\"[53] This, the twelfth resolution, passed.\\r\\nMary Ann M'Clintock, Jr. spoke briefly, calling upon woman to arouse from her lethargy and be true to herself and her God. Douglass again rose to speak in support of the cause of woman.[53] Lucretia Mott spoke for an hour with one of her \\"most beautiful and spiritual appeals\\".[53] Although Lucretia Mott's reputation as a speaker drew the audience, Mott recognized Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Mary Ann M'Clintock as the \\"chief planners and architects\\" of the convention.[12] To close the meeting, a committee was appointed to edit and publish the convention proceedings, with Amy Post, Eunice Newton Foote, Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., Elizabeth W. M'Clintock and Stanton serving.[12]\\r\\nLocal newspapers printed reports of the convention, some positive, others not. The National Reformer reported that the convention \\"forms an era in the progress of the age; it being the first convention of the kind ever held, and one whose influence shall not cease until woman is guaranteed all the rights now enjoyed by the other half of creationSocial, Civil and POLITICAL.\\"[42] The Oneida Whig did not approve of the convention, writing of the Declaration: \\"This bolt is the most shocking and unnatural incident ever recorded in the history of womanity. If our ladies will insist on voting and legislating, where, gentleman, will be our dinners and our elbows? Where our domestic firesides and the holes in our stockings?\\"[54]\\r\\nSoon, newspapers across the country picked up the story. Reactions varied widely. In Massachusetts, the Lowell Courier published its opinion that, with women's equality, \\"the lords must wash the dishes, scour up, be put to the tub, handle the broom, darn stockings.\\"[20] In St. Louis, Missouri, the Daily Reveille trumpeted that \\"the flag of independence has been hoisted for the second time on this side of the Atlantic.\\"[20] Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune wrote \\"When a sincere republican is asked to say in sober earnest what adequate reason he can give, for refusing the demand of women to an equal participation with men in political rights, he must answer, None at all. However unwise and mistaken the demand, it is but the assertion of a natural right, and such must be conceded.\\"[20]\\r\\nSome of the ministers heading congregations in the area attended the Seneca Falls Convention, but none spoke out during the sessions, not even when comments from the floor were invited. On Sunday, July 23, many who had attended, and more who had not, attacked the Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments, and the resolutions. Women in the congregations reported to Stanton, who saw the actions of the ministers as cowardly; in their congregations, no one would be allowed to reply.[55]\\r\\nSigners of the Declaration of Sentiments hoped for \\"a series of Conventions, embracing every part of the country\\" to follow their own meeting. Because of the fame and drawing power of Lucretia Mott, who would not be staying in the Upstate New York area for much longer, some of the participants at Seneca Falls organized the Rochester Women's Rights Convention two weeks later in Rochester, New York with Lucretia Mott as its featured speaker. Unlike the Seneca Falls convention, the Rochester convention took the controversial step of electing a woman, Abigail Bush, as its presiding officer. In the next two years, \\"the infancy?... of the movement\\",[56] other local and state women's rights conventions were called in Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.[57]\\r\\nCharlotte Woodward, alone among all 100 signers, was the only one still alive in 1920 when the Nineteenth Amendment passed. Woodward was not well enough to vote herself.[58]\\r\\nA stamp was issued in 1948 in remembrance of the Seneca Falls Convention, featuring Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Carrie Chapman Catt, and Lucretia Mott as part of a Centennial Celebration in Seneca Falls.\\r\\nThe Women's Rights National Historical Park was established in 1980, and covers a total of 6.83 acres (27,600 m2) of land in Seneca Falls and nearby Waterloo, New York, USA. The park consists of four major historical properties, including the Wesleyan Methodist Church, which was the site of the Seneca Falls Convention, Elizabeth Cady Stanton's home, and the M'Clintock House, which was where the Declaration of Sentiments, resolutions, and speeches were drawn up for the Seneca Falls Convention. The Wesleyan Methodist Church and the M'Clintock House were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\\r\\nIn 1998 First Lady Hillary Clinton gave a speech on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention.[59]\\r\\nIn 1870, Paulina Wright Davis authored a history of the antebellum women's rights movement, The History of the National Woman's Rights Movement, and received approval of her account from many of the involved suffragists including Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.[7] Davis' version gave the Seneca Falls meeting in 1848 a minor role, equivalent to other local meetings that had been held by women's groups in the late 1840s. Davis set the beginning of the national and international women's rights movement at Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850, at the National Women's Rights Convention when women from many states were invited, the influence of which was felt across the continent and in Great Britain.[7] Stanton seemed to agree; in an address to the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) convention in 1870, on the subject of the women's rights movement, she said \\"The movement in England, as in America, may be dated from the first National Convention, held at Worcester, Mass., October, 1850.\\"[60]\\r\\nIn 1876, in the spirit of the nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and Susan B. Anthony decided to write a more expansive history of the women's rights movement. They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone declined to be part of the project; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, and placed themselves at each of its most important events, marginalizing Stone's contribution.[61]\\r\\nAccording to Lisa Tetrault, a professor of women's history, the Seneca Falls Convention was central to their rendition of the movement's history. Neither Stanton nor Anthony had been at the 1850 convention, which was associated with their rivals. Stanton, however, had played a key role at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, at which Stone had not been present. In the early 1870s, Stanton and Anthony began to present Seneca Falls as the beginning of the women's rights movement, an origin story that downplayed Stone's role. Pointing out that the women's rights movement could be said to have begun even earlier than Seneca Falls, Tetrault said the History of Woman Suffrage dealt with these earlier events relatively briefly in its first three chapters, the first of which is titled \\"Preceding Causes.\\"[62] In the volume, Stanton did not mention the Liberty Party's plank on woman suffrage pre-dating the Seneca Falls Convention by a month, and she did not describe the Worcester National Women's Rights Convention, organized by Stone and Davis in 1850, as the beginning of the women's rights movement. Rather, Stanton named the 1840 Anti-Slavery Convention in London as the birth of the \\"movement for woman's suffrage, in both England and America\\".[7] She positioned the Seneca Falls meeting as her own political debut, and characterized it as the beginning of the women's rights movement,[15] calling it \\"the greatest movement for human liberty recorded on the pages of historya demand for freedom to one-half the entire race.\\"[4] Stanton worked to enshrine the Declaration of Sentiments as a foundational treatise in a number of ways, not the least of which was by imbuing the small, three-legged tea table upon which the first draft of it was composed an importance similar to that of Thomas Jefferson's desk upon which he wrote the Declaration of Independence.[15] The M'Clintocks gave Stanton the table, then Stanton gave it to Susan B. Anthony on the occasion of her 80th birthday,[63] though Anthony had no part in the Seneca Falls meeting.[26] In keeping with Stanton's promotion of the table as an iconic relic, women's rights activists put it in a place of honor at the head of the casket at the funeral of Susan B. Anthony on March 14, 1906.[64] Subsequently, it was displayed prominently on the stage at each of the most important suffrage meetings until 1920,[63] even though the grievance and resolution about woman suffrage was not written on it.[32] The table is kept at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.[65]\\r\\nLucretia Mott reflected in August 1848 upon the two women's rights conventions in which she had participated that summer, and assessed them no greater than other projects and missions she was involved with. She wrote that the two gatherings were \\"greatly encouraging; and give hope that this long neglected subject will soon begin to receive the attention that its importance demands.\\"[4]\\r\\nHistorian Gerda Lerner has pointed out that religious ideas provided a fundamental source for the Declaration of Sentiments. Most of the women attending the convention were active in Quaker or evangelical Methodist movements. The document itself drew from writings by the evangelical Quaker Sarah Grimk to make biblical claims that God had created woman equal to man and that man had usurped God's authority by establishing \\"absolute tyranny\\" over woman.[66] According to author Jami Carlacio, Grimk's writings opened the public's eyes to ideas like women's rights, and for the first time they were willing to question conventional notions about the subordination of women.[67]","input":"Where was the first women's right convention held?"},{"output":"And in the End...","context":"\\"And in the End...\\" is the 331st and final episode of the American television series ER.

After the event, he has an awkward reunion with Joshua's mother Kem (Thandie Newton), who is briefly in town; she isn't particularly happy to see Carter and coldly rebuffs his efforts to re-connect with her, but does reluctantly agree with his plan to join her at the airport for her flight back to Paris. He also has drinks with his old friends plus Elizabeth Corday (Alex Kingston), who brought Rachel to Chicago for her med school interview. Benton and Corday linger together after everyone else go their separate ways.\\r\\nMarjorie Manning (Beverly Polcyn), a previous elderly multiple sclerosis patient suffering sepsis and pulmonary edema, comes in with her husband (Ernest Borgnine). Mr. Manning is initially unwilling to let Marjorie go, but with guidance from Dr. Gates, he finally accepts the inevitable. Before Marjorie dies, her daughter arrives, and confides in Samantha Taggart (Linda Cardellini) that her mother was an incredibly difficult person who picked fights with and alienated everyone in her life, but she loved her mom anyway and was inspired by how her father was saint-like in putting up with her miserable behavior. Sam looks saddened and ashamed as she clearly sees the parallel between Marjorie and herself, and she ends up calling her own estranged mother after Marjorie has passed away.\\r\\nIt turns out it is Samantha's birthday. Her son Alex (Dominic Janes) reveals her present: a vintage Ford Mustang restored by Alex and Tony, who both decided upon bright red as its color over cobalt blue. Later on, while they are walking back towards the ER, Sam surprises Tony by taking his hand in hers, symbolizing that she has gotten over her previous anger at him, and he smiles and locks his fingers with hers.\\r\\nA young bride and her new mother-in-law (Marilu Henner) both come in, in separate ambulances, with minor injuries sustained in a drunken brawl at their wedding reception, and continue arguing all the way into the treatment rooms. The groom later arrives, and is promptly torn between tending to his mother and his new wife.\\r\\nThe episode ends with the beginning of a disaster protocol: an industrial explosion, with a minimum of eight casualties. Dr. Carter is again pressed into service to assist, and he gives up on Kem once and for all by nixing his plans to meet her at the airport. Dr. Morris is ordered by Dr. Banfield to triage patients as they arrive. The first patient was thrown 20 feet, and is diagnosed as a possible lacerated spleen or liver, to be sent straight to the OR. The second patient has a compound leg fracture with no circulatory impairment, which Dr. Banfield takes herself for an orthopedic consult. The third patient was electrocuted, and fell into asystole on the way in, declared DOA. The fourth patient has smoke inhalation, relatively minor burns and a pneumothorax, and is set up for a chest tube. The fifth patient had his left arm blown off below the elbow, with nothing left to save; Dr. Gates takes him in to repair the damage. Dr. Morris gives the sixth patient to Dr. Carter: third-degree burns over 90% coverage. As he runs the patient in, Dr. Carter asks Rachel to tag along saying \\"Dr. Greene, you comin'?\\", which she does enthusiastically. As Morris continues to triage patients, the original theme music plays and the point of view pulls back, revealing the entire hospital for the first and only time.\\r\\nThe episode was structured \\"very much like the show's pilot. Like that first episode, it took place over the course of 24 hours, featured a dizzying number of cases  some comical, and some that were dead serious  and showed the life of the ER through eyes both inexperienced ... and jaded.\\"[1] It featured several direct references to the pilot and other early episodes, including: Dr. Archie Morris is woken by veteran nurse Lydia Wright, who had done the same to Dr. Mark Greene in the pilot (the shot is used in several early episodes); Dr. John Carter demonstrating how to start an IV to Rachel Greene exactly as Dr. Peter Benton showed him in the pilot; a comedic scene dealing with a child who had swallowed a rosary, as in the pilot, when a child swallowed a key; and the day marked by cutscenes showing the time at the start of each act as was done in the series' fifth episode, \\"Into That Good Night\\", with both episodes starting and ending at 4:00?AM. A portion of the storyline was inspired by the death of producer John Wells' 17-year-old niece, who died of alcohol poisoning in December 2008.[2]\\r\\nThe episode featured full-length opening credits from the first season (albeit with shots and credits added for both the final regular cast, and five of the past stars that appeared) with music by James Newton Howard, the show's original composer.[1] That theme music also played as the camera pulled out and faded at the end of the last scene of the episode, which showed the entire exterior of County General Hospital for the only time in the history of the series, except in high tone and fully in 1080i HD.\\r\\nDoctors\\r\\nNurses\\r\\nStaff\\r\\nParamedics\\r\\nIn his review in the then-St. Petersburg Times, Eric Deggans called the final episode \\"a welcome reminder of why the show has lasted 15 years on network television  and proof of why it's now time for the show to go.\\" He continued, \\"Thanks to cameo appearances by most key actors whose characters remain alive... the episode had the feel of a friendly class reunion... Once upon a time, the cases that filled Thursday's episode would have felt groundbreaking and fresh... But on Thursday, these contrivances felt like shadows echoing other, better episodes long past... Wells echoed the series most consistent theme by showing old and new doctors uniting to handle yet another emergency at the finale's end. But Thursday's episode also proved that NBC's ER called it quits at just the right time, because TV series  unlike medical institutions  should never go on forever.\\"[3]\\r\\nKen Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said he \\"liked the fact that the surprises were small but effective,\\" while Alan Sepinwall of the Star-Ledger stated, \\"It wasn't an all-time great finale, but it did what it set out to do.\\" In the Baltimore Sun, David Zurawik said, \\"I especially liked the final scene with the ER team suiting up and standing ready to respond in the courtyard to the arriving fleet of emergency vehicles loaded with victims of an industrial explosion. Perhaps, it was one last tweak at the critics who said the pilot looked more like a feature film and would never make it as a TV series  because it was definitely a movie ending.\\"[4] The episode received an A- from The A.V. Club.[5]\\r\\nIn 2010, Time magazine ranked the episode as #10 on its list of the most anticipated TV finales.[6]\\r\\nAccording to Nielsen ratings, the finale gave NBC \\"its best ratings on the night in a long time.\\" The first hour received a 9.6 rating and a 15 share, numbers which improved to an 11.1 rating and 19 share in the final hour.[7] Overall the finale attracted an average of 16.2 million viewers.[8][9]\\r\\nThe series finale of ER scored the highest 18-49 rating for a drama series finale since The X-Files wrapped with a 6.3 on May 19, 2002. In total viewers, ER assembled the biggest overall audience for a drama series finale since Murder, She Wrote concluded with 16.5 million on May 19, 1996.\\r\\nIn Canada, the finale fared even better on a percentage basis with 2.768 million viewers. With ten times less the population, this equates to roughly 27.68 million American viewers.[10]\\r\\nTimeslot 18ÿ49/share 18ÿ34/share viewers (millions)\\r\\n8PM[7]\\r\\n9PM[7]\\r\\n10PM[7]\\r\\nAt the 2009 Primetime Emmy Awards Rod Holcomb won the Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for his work on this episode, while Ernest Borgnine was nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.[11]","input":"What was the very last episode of er?"},{"output":"in an address to the Parliament of the United Kingdom by Jack Ashley in 1973","context":"","input":"When was the term domestic violence first used?"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},M={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,o){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),i(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",M,[(a(!0),i(l,null,g(o.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(B,[["render",x]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/47.md","filePath":"qapage/47.md"}'),H={name:"qapage/47.md"},E=Object.assign(H,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{F as __pageData,E as default};
