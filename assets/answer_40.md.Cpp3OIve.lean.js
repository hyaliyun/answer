Cell membranes are generally impermeable to ions , thus they must diffuse through the membrane through transmembrane protein channels . They have a crucial role in excitable cells such as neuronal and muscle tissues , allowing a rapid and co-ordinated depolarization in response to triggering voltage change . Found along the axon and at the synapse , voltage - gated ion channels directionally propagate electrical signals . Voltage - gated ion - channels are usually ion - specific , and channels specific to sodium ( Na ) , potassium ( K ) , calcium ( Ca ) , and chloride ( Cl ) ions have been identified . The opening and closing of the channels are triggered by changing ion concentration , and hence charge gradient , between the sides of the cell membrane ."},{"query":"when did i get my eagle scout award","short_answer":"","abstract":"Distinguished Eagle Scouts"},{"query":"the guernsey literary and potato peel society movie plot","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a 2018 British historical drama directed by Mike Newell and written by Don Roos and Tom Bezucha .

In other words , the law of demand describes an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded of a good .

The main function of the SR is to store calcium ions ( Ca ) . Calcium ion levels are kept relatively constant , with the concentration of calcium ions within a cell being 100,000 times smaller than the concentration of calcium ions outside the cell . This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes ( the calcium is said to be a second messenger ; see calcium in biology for more details ) . Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate ( found in chalk ) and calcium phosphate , two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones . This means that too much calcium within the cells can lead to hardening ( calcification ) of certain intracellular structures , including the mitochondria , leading to cell death . Therefore , it is vital that calcium ion levels are controlled tightly , and can be released into the cell when necessary and then remove from the cell ."},{"query":"which system of voting is used in the house of representatives","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Australian electoral system comprises the laws and processes used for the election of members of the Australian Parliament .

It was proposed by Ernst Munch , a German plant physiologist in 1930 . A high concentration of organic substances , particularly sugar , inside cells of the phloem at a source , such as a leaf , creates a diffusion gradient ( osmotic gradient ) that draws water into the cells from the adjacent xylem . This creates turgor pressure , also known as hydrostatic pressure , in the phloem . Movement of phloem sap occurs by bulk flow ( mass flow ) from sugar sources to sugar sinks . The movement in phloem is bidirectional , whereas , in xylem cells , it is unidirectional ( upward ) . Because of this multi-directional flow , coupled with the fact that sap can not move with ease between adjacent sieve - tubes , it is not unusual for sap in adjacent sieve - tubes to be flowing in opposite directions ."},{"query":"when was the last time the bills were 5 and 2","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of seasons completed by the Buffalo Bills American football franchise .

The easiest way to tell if a FET is common source , common drain , or common gate is to examine where the signal enters and leaves . The remaining terminal is what is known as \`\` common '' . In this example , the signal enters the gate , and exits the drain . The only terminal remaining is the source . This is a common - source FET circuit . The analogous bipolar junction transistor circuit may be viewed as a transconductance amplifier or as a voltage amplifier . ( See classification of amplifiers ) . As a transconductance amplifier , the input voltage is seen as modulating the current going to the load . As a voltage amplifier , input voltage modulates the amount of current flowing through the FET , changing the voltage across the output resistance according to Ohm 's law . However , the FET device 's output resistance typically is not high enough for a reasonable transconductance amplifier ( ideally infinite ) , nor low enough for a decent voltage amplifier ( ideally zero ) . Another major drawback is the amplifier 's limited high - frequency response . Therefore , in practice the output often is routed through either a voltage follower ( common - drain or CD stage ) , or a current follower ( common-gate or CG stage ) , to obtain more favorable output and frequency characteristics . The CS -- CG combination is called a cascode amplifier ."},{"query":"when does the european soccer transfer window close","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"when does peyton find out she's adopted","short_answer":"In season 3","abstract":"Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer is a fictional character from The WB / CW television series One Tree Hill , portrayed by Hilarie Burton .

They are also involved in regulating transcription , mRNA processing , and the differentiation of nerve cells . They are present in all known eukaryotes , and their regulatory function in the cell cycle has been evolutionarily conserved . In fact , yeast cells can proliferate normally when their CDK gene has been replaced with the homologous human gene . CDKs are relatively small proteins , with molecular weights ranging from 34 to 40 kDa , and contain little more than the kinase domain . By definition , a CDK binds a regulatory protein called a cyclin . Without cyclin , CDK has little kinase activity ; only the cyclin - CDK complex is an active kinase . CDKs phosphorylate their substrates on serines and threonines , so they are serine - threonine kinases . The consensus sequence for the phosphorylation site in the amino acid sequence of a CDK substrate is ( S / T * ) PX ( K / R ) , where S / T * is the phosphorylated serine or threonine , P is proline , X is any amino acid , K is lysine , and R is arginine ."},{"query":"what is the fourth letter of the greek alphabet","short_answer":"delta","abstract":"The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC .

Small amounts of carbohydrates are also found in cell membrane . The model , which was devised by SJ Singer and GL Nicolson in 1972 , describes the cell membrane as a two - dimensional liquid that restricts the lateral diffusion of membrane components . Such domains are defined by the existence of regions within the membrane with special lipid and protein composition that promote the formation of lipid rafts or protein and glycoprotein complexes . Another way to define membrane domains is the association of the lipid membrane with the cytoskeleton filaments and the extracellular matrix through membrane proteins . The current model describes important features relevant to many cellular processes , including : cell - cell signaling , apoptosis , cell division , membrane budding , and cell fusion . The fluid mosaic model is the most acceptable model of plasma membrane . Fluid mosaic model is proposed by SJ Singer and G Nicolson in 1972 .

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases .

This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese .

Titled ' Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse ' , Hall 's essay offers a theoretical approach of how media messages are produced , disseminated , and interpreted . As an important member of the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies , Hall had a major influence on media studies . His model claims that television and other media audiences are presented with messages that are decoded , or interpreted in different ways depending on an individual 's cultural background , economic standing , and personal experiences . In contrast to other media theories that disempower audiences , Hall proposed that audience members can play an active role in decoding messages as they rely on their own social contexts , and might be capable of changing messages themselves through collective action . In simpler terms , encoding / decoding is the translation of a message that is easily understood . When you decode a message , you extract the meaning of that message in ways that make sense to you . Decoding has both verbal and non-verbal forms of communication : Decoding behavior without using words means observing body language and its associated emotions . For example , some body language signs for when someone is upset , angry , or stressed would be a use of excessive hand / arm movements , red in the face , crying , and even sometimes silence . Sometimes when someone is trying to get a message across to someone , the message can be interpreted differently from person to person . Decoding is all about the understanding of what someone already knows , based on the information given throughout the message being received . Whether there is a large audience or exchanging a message to one person , decoding is the process of obtaining , absorbing , understanding , and sometimes using the information that was given throughout a verbal or non-verbal message ."},{"query":"who played emily's father on designated survivor","short_answer":"","abstract":"The second season of the American political drama series Designated Survivor was ordered on May 11 , 2017 .

Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves . The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American Civil War . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States . These periods of prison construction and reform produced major changes in the structure of prison systems and their missions , the responsibilities of federal and state agencies for administering and supervising them , as well as the legal and political status of prisoners themselves ."},{"query":"the bird that flew over the cuckoo's nest","short_answer":"","abstract":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest is a 1975 American comedy - drama film directed by Miloš Forman , based on the 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest by Ken Kesey .

The term was coined by Marcellin Berthelot from the Greek roots endo - , derived from the word \`\` endon '' ( ἔνδον ) meaning \`\` within '' and the root \`\` therm '' ( θερμ - ) meaning \`\` hot '' or \`\` warm '' intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed . The opposite of an endothermic process is an exothermic process , one that releases , \`\` gives out '' energy in the form of heat . Thus in each term ( endothermic & exothermic ) the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs , though in reality it only refers to where the energy goes , without necessarily being in the form of heat . All chemical reactions involve both the breaking of existing and the making of new chemical bonds . A reaction to break a bond always requires the input of energy and so such a process is always endothermic . When atoms come together to form new chemical bonds , the electrostatic forces bringing them together leave the bond with a large excess of energy ( usually in the form of vibrations and rotations ) . If that energy is not dissipated , the new bond would quickly break apart again . Instead , the new bond can shed its excess energy - by radiation , by transfer to other motions in the molecule , or to other molecules through collisions - and then become a stable new bond .

In other words , this law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed ; rather , it can only be transformed from one form to another . For instance , chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when a stick of dynamite explodes .

Population change is driven by classic demographic mechanisms -- birth , death , age structure , and migration . However , in political demography , there is always scope for assimilation as well as boundary and identity change , which can redraw the boundaries of populations in a way that is not possible with biological populations . Typically , political - demographic projections can account for both demographic factors and transitions caused by social change . A notable leader in the area of sub-state population projection is the World Population Program of the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis ( IIASA ) in Laxenburg , Austria . Some of the issues which are studied in the context of political demography are : surges of young people in the developing world , significantly increasing aging in the developed world , and the impact of increasing urbanization . Political demographers study issues like population growth in a political context . A population 's growth is impacted by the relative balance of variables like mortality , fertility and immigration . Many of the present world 's most powerful nations are aging quickly , largely as a result of major decreases in fertility rates and major increases in life expectancies . As the labor pools in these nations shrink , and spending on the elderly increases , their economies are likely to slow down . By 2050 , the workforce in Japan and Russia is predicted to decrease by more than 30 percent , while the German workforce is expected to decline by 25 percent by that year . The governments of these countries have made financial commitments to the elderly in their populations which will consume huge percentages of their national GDP . For example , based on current numbers , more than 25 % of the national GDPs of Japan , France and Germany will be consumed by these commitments by 2040 ."},{"query":"some good things to be said for the iron age poem","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ( originally The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere ) is the longest major poem by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge , written in 1797 -- 98 and published in 1798 in the first edition of Lyrical Ballads .

The units MLSS is primarily measured in are milligram per litre ( mg / L ) , but for activated sludge its mostly measured in gram per liter ( g / l ) which is equal to kilogram per m3 ( kg / m3 ) . Mixed liquor is a combination of raw or unsettled wastewater or pre-settled wastewater and activated sludge within an aeration tank . MLSS consists mostly of microorganisms and non-biodegradable suspended matter . MLSS is an important part of the activated sludge process to ensure that there is a sufficient quantity of active biomass available to consume the applied quantity of organic pollutant at any time . This is known as the food to microorganism ratio , more commonly notated as the F / M ratio . By maintaining this ratio at the appropriate level the biomass will consume high percentages of the food . This minimizes the loss of residual food in the treated effluent . In simple terms , the more the biomass consumes the lower the biochemical oxygen demand ( BOD ) will be in the discharge . It is important that MLSS removes COD and BOD in order to purify water for clean surface waters , and subsequently clean drinking water and hygiene . Raw sewage enters in the water treatment process with a concentration of sometimes several hundred mg / L of BOD . Upon being treated with MLSS and other methods of treatment , the concentration of BOD in water is lowered to less than 2 mg / L , which is considered to be clean , safe to discharge to surface waters or to reuse water ."},{"query":"20th century legal barriers to minority voting included all of the following except","short_answer":"","abstract":"Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era in the United States of America was based on a series of laws , new constitutions , and practices in the South that were deliberately used to prevent black citizens from registering to vote and voting .
