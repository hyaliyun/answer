It is the official language of Georgia.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgian is written in its own writing system, the Georgian script.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgian is the literary language for all regional subgroups of Georgians, including those who speak other Kartvelian languages: Svans, Mingrelians and the Laz.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgian is the most pervasive of the Kartvelian languages, a family that also includes Svan and Megrelian (chiefly spoken in Northwest Georgia) and Laz (chiefly spoken along the Black Sea coast of Turkey, from Melyat, Rize, to the Georgian frontier).\\r\\n\\r\\nDialects of Georgian are from Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi, Guria, Adjara, Imerkhevi (in Turkey), Kartli, Kakheti, Saingilo (in Azerbaijan), Tusheti, Khevsureti, Khevi, Pshavi, Fereydan (in Iran), Mtiuleti and Meskheti.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the Georgian language can conventionally be divided into:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgian shares an ancestral language with Mingrelian/Laz and Svan. Georgian as separate from the other Kartvelian languages would have emerged in the 1st millennium BC in the area known later as the Kingdom of Iberia. The earliest allusion to spoken Georgian may be a passage of the Roman grammarian Marcus Cornelius Fronto in the 2nd century: Fronto imagines the Iberians addressing the emperor Marcus Aurelius in their \\"incomprehensible tongue\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evolution of Georgian into a written language was a consequence of the conversion of the Georgian elite to Christianity in the mid-4th century. The new literary language was constructed on an already well-established cultural infrastructure, appropriating the functions, conventions, and status of Aramaic, the literary language of pagan Georgia, and the new national religion.[3] The first Georgian texts are inscriptions and palimpsests dating to the 5th century. Georgian has a rich literary tradition. The oldest surviving literary work in Georgian is the 5th century Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik (??????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????) by Iakob Tsurtaveli.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 11th century,  Old Georgian gives rise to Middle Georgian, the literary language of the medieval kingdom of Georgia. The Georgian national epic, Shota Rustaveli's The Knight in the Panther's Skin (??????????????), dates from the 12th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1629, Alphabetum Ibericum sive Georgianum cum Oratione and Dittionario giorgiano e italiano were the first two books printed in the Georgian language using movable type in Rome supported by the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples of the Catholic Church for their evangelical movement in Georgian kingdoms. This marked the beginning of the modern Georgian language.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymbols on the left are those of the IPA and those on the right are of the modern Georgian alphabet.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer /q?/ (?) has merged with /x/ (?), leaving only the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe glottalization of the ejectives is rather light, and in many romanization systems it is not marked, for transcriptions such as ejective p, t, ts, ch, k and q, against aspirated p, t, ts, ch and k (as in transcriptions of Armenian).\\r\\n\\r\\nProsody in Georgian involves stress, intonation, and rhythm.  Stress is very weak, and linguists disagree as to where stress occurs in words.[8]  Jun, Vicenik, and Lofstedt have proposed that Georgian stress and intonation are the result of pitch accents on the first syllable of a word and near the end of a phrase.[9]  The rhythm of Georgian speech is syllable-timed.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgian contains many \\"harmonic clusters\\" involving two consonants of a similar type (voiced, aspirated, or ejective) which are pronounced with only a single release; e.g. ????? bgera (sound), ???????? tskhovreba (life), and ????? ts'q'ali (water).[10] There are also frequent consonant clusters, sometimes involving more than six consonants in a row, as may be seen in words like ????????? gvprtskvni (\\"You peel us\\") and ????????? mts'vrtneli (\\"trainer\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nVicenik has observed that Georgian vowels following ejective stops have creaky voice and suggests this may be one cue distinguishing ejectives from their aspirated and voiced counterparts.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgian has been written in a variety of scripts over its history. Currently the Mkhedruli or \\"Military\\" script is almost completely dominant; the others are used mostly in religious documents and architecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nMkhedruli has 33 letters in common use; a half dozen more are obsolete in Georgian, though still used in other alphabets, like Mingrelian, Laz, and Svan. The letters of Mkhedruli correspond closely to the phonemes of the Georgian language.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the traditional account written down by Leonti Mroveli in the 11th century, the first Georgian script was created by the first ruler of the Kingdom of Iberia, Pharnavaz, in the 3rd century BC. However, the first examples of a Georgian script date from the 5th century AD. There are now three Georgian scripts, called Asomtavruli \\"capitals\\", Nuskhuri \\"small letters\\", and Mkhedruli. The first two are used together as upper and lower case in the writings of the Georgian Orthodox Church and together are called Khutsuri \\"priests' [alphabet]\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mkhedruli, there is no case. Sometimes, however, a capital-like effect, called Mtavruli, \\"title\\" or \\"heading\\", is achieved by modifying the letters so that their vertical sizes are identical and they rest on the baseline with no descenders. These capital-like letters are often used in page headings, chapter titles, monumental inscriptions, and the like.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the Georgian standard[12] keyboard layout. The standard Windows keyboard is essentially that of manual typewriters.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgian is an agglutinative language. There are certain prefixes and suffixes that are joined together in order to build a verb. In some cases, there can be up to eight different morphemes in one verb at the same time. An example can be ageshenebinat (\\"you (pl) had built\\"). The verb can be broken down to parts: a-g-e-shen-eb-in-a-t. Each morpheme here contributes to the meaning of the verb tense or the person who has performed the verb. The verb conjugation also exhibits polypersonalism; a verb may potentially include morphemes representing both the subject and the object.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Georgian morphophonology, syncope is a common phenomenon. When a suffix (especially the plural suffix -eb-) is attached to a word which has either of the vowels a or e in the last syllable, this vowel is, in most words, lost. For example, megobari means \\"friend\\". To say \\"friends\\", one says, megob?rebi (megobrebi), with the loss of a in the last syllable of the word root.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgian has seven noun cases: nominative, ergative, dative, genitive, instrumental, adverbial and vocative. An interesting feature of Georgian is that, while the subject of a sentence is generally  in the nominative case, and the object is in the accusative case (or dative), in Georgian, one can find this reversed in many situations (this depends mainly on the character of the verb). This is called the dative construction. In the past tense of the transitive verbs, and in the present tense of the verb \\"to know\\", the subject is in the ergative case.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgian has a rich word-derivation system. By using a root, and adding some definite prefixes and suffixes, one can derive many nouns and adjectives from the root. For example, from the root -kartv-, the following words can be derived: Kartveli (a Georgian person), Kartuli (the Georgian language) and Sakartvelo (Georgia).\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Georgian surnames end in -dze (\\"son\\") (Western Georgia), -shvili (\\"child\\") (Eastern Georgia), -ia (Western Georgia, Samegrelo), -ani (Western Georgia, Svaneti), -uri (Eastern Georgia), etc.  The ending -eli is a particle of nobility, equivalent to French de, German von or Polish -ski.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgian has a vigesimal numeric system like Basque or French, based on the counting system of 20.  In order to express a number greater than 20 and less than 100, first the number of 20s in the number is stated and the remaining number is added. For example, 93 is expressed as ?????????????? - otkh-m-ots-da-tsamet'i (lit. four-times-twenty-and-thirteen).\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most important Georgian dictionaries is the Explanatory dictionary of the Georgian language (Georgian: ??????? ???? ???????????? ?????????). It consists of eight volumes and about 115,000 words. It was produced between 1950 and 1964, by a team of linguists under the direction of Arnold Chikobava.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgian has a word derivation system, which allows the derivation of nouns from verb roots both with prefixes and suffixes, for example:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also possible to derive verbs from nouns:\\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise, verbs can be derived from adjectives, for example:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Georgian many nouns and adjectives begin with two or more contiguous consonants. This is because most syllables in the language begin with certain two consonants. \\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Georgian:\\r\\n\\r\\n????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ????????? ?????? ????????? ?? ?????????. ??? ?????????? ???? ?????? ?? ??????? ?? ?????????? ?????? ???? ????????? ?????? ?????????????.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ'vela adamiani ibadeba tavisupali da tanasts'ori tavisi ghirsebita da uplebebit.

Most areas of the United States observe daylight saving time (DST), the exceptions being Arizona (except for the Navajo, who do observe daylight saving time on tribal lands),[1] Hawaii,[2] and the overseas territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The Uniform Time Act of 1966 established the system of uniform Daylight Saving Time throughout the US.\\r\\nIn the U.S., daylight saving time starts on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November, with the time changes taking place at 2:00?a.m. local time. With a mnemonic word play referring to seasons, clocks \\"spring forward, fall back\\"that is, in springtime the clocks are moved forward from 2:00?a.m. to 3:00?a.m. and in fall they are moved back from 2:00?a.m. to 1:00?a.m. Daylight saving time lasts for a total of 34 weeks (238 days) every year, about 65% of the entire year.\\r\\nThe following table lists recent past and near future starting and ending dates of daylight saving time in the United States:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin proposed a form of daylight time in 1784. His essay, An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost of Light, written to the editor of The Journal of Paris, observed that Parisians could save on candles by getting out of bed earlier in the morning, making use of the natural morning light instead. Franklin's suggestion seems to have been more of a joke than a real proposal, and nothing came of it.[3]\\r\\nDuring World War I, in an effort to conserve fuel, Germany began observing DST on May 1, 1916. The rest of Europe soon followed. The plan was not adopted in the United States until the Standard Time Act of March 19, 1918, which confirmed the existing standard time zone system and set summer DST to begin on March 31, 1918 (reverting October 27).[4] The idea was unpopular and Congress abolished DST after the war, overriding President Woodrow Wilson's veto.[5] DST became a local option and was observed in some states until World War II, when President Franklin Roosevelt instituted year-round DST, called \\"War Time\\", on February 9, 1942.[6] It lasted until the last Sunday (the 30th) in September 1945. After 1945 many states and cities east of the Mississippi River (and mostly north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers) adopted summer DST.[7]\\r\\nFrom 1945 to 1966 there was no federal law on daylight saving time, so localities could choose when it began and ended or drop it entirely. As of 1954, only California and Nevada had statewide DST west of the Mississippi, and only a few cities between Nevada and St. Louis. In the 1964 Official Railway Guide, 21 of the 48 contiguous states had no DST anywhere.\\r\\nBy 1962, the transportation industry found the lack of consistency confusing enough to push for federal regulation. The result was the Uniform Time Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-387). Beginning in 1967, the act mandated standard time within the established time zones and provided for advanced time: clocks would be advanced one hour beginning at 2:00?a.m. on the last Sunday in April and turned back one hour at 2:00?a.m. on the last Sunday in October. States were allowed to exempt themselves from DST as long as the entire state did so. If a state chose to observe DST, the time changes were required to begin and end on the established dates. In 1967, Arizona and Michigan became the first states to exempt themselves from DST (Michigan would begin observing DST in 1972). In 1972, the act was amended (P.L. 92-267), allowing those states split between time zones to exempt either the entire state or that part of the state lying within a different time zone. The newly created Department of Transportation (DOT) was given power to enforce the law. As of 2014, the following states and territories are not observing DST: Arizona, Hawaii, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.[7]\\r\\nDuring the 1973 oil embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), in an effort to conserve fuel, Congress enacted a trial period of year-round DST (P.L. 93-182), beginning January 6, 1974, and ending April 27, 1975.[8] The trial was hotly debated. Those in favor pointed to increased daylight hours in the summer evening: more time for recreation, reduced lighting and heating demands, reduced crime, and reduced automobile accidents. The opposition was concerned about children leaving for school in the dark. The act was amended in October 1974 (P.L. 93-434) to return to standard time for the period beginning October 27, 1974, and ending February 23, 1975, when DST resumed. When the trial ended in 1975, the country returned to observing summer DST (with the aforementioned exceptions).[7]\\r\\nThe DOT, evaluating the plan of extending DST into March, reported in 1975 that \\"modest overall benefits might be realized by a shift from the historic six-month DST (May through October) in areas of energy conservation, overall traffic safety and reduced violent crime.\\" However, DOT also reported that these benefits were minimal and difficult to distinguish from seasonal variations and fluctuations in energy prices.[7]\\r\\nCongress then asked the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, today NIST) to evaluate the DOT report. Its report, \\"Review and Technical Evaluation of the DOT Daylight Saving Time Study\\" (April 1976), found no significant energy savings or differences in traffic fatalities.[9] It did find statistically significant evidence of increased fatalities among school-age children in the mornings during the four-month period JanuaryÿApril 1974 as compared with the same period (non-DST) of 1973. NBS stated that it was impossible to determine, what, if any, of this increase was due to DST. When this data was compared between 1973 and 1974 for the months of March and April, no significant difference was found in fatalities among school-age children in the mornings.[7]\\r\\nIn 1986 Congress enacted P.L. 99-359, amending the Uniform Time Act by changing the beginning of DST to the first Sunday in April and having the end remain the last Sunday in October.[7] These start and end dates were in effect from 1987 to 2006. The time was adjusted at 2:00?a.m. local time.\\r\\nBy the Energy Policy Act of 2005, daylight saving time (DST) was extended in the United States beginning in 2007.[10] As from that year, DST begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. In years when April 1 falls on Monday through Wednesday, these changes result in a DST period that is five weeks longer; in all other years the DST period is instead four weeks longer.[11] In 2008 daylight saving time ended at 2:00?a.m. DST (0200) (1:00?a.m. ST) on Sunday, November 2, and in 2009 it began at 2:00?a.m. (3:00?a.m. DST) on Sunday, March 8.[12]\\r\\nUnder Section 110 of the Act, the U.S. Department of Energy was required to study the impact of the 2007 DST extension no later than nine months after the change took effect. The report, released in October 2008, reported a nationwide electricity savings of 0.03% for the year of 2007.[13]\\r\\nAn October 2008 study conducted by the University of California at Santa Barbara for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the 2006 DST adoption in Indiana increased energy consumption in Indiana by an average of 1%. Although consumption for lighting dropped as a result of the DST adoption, consumption for heating and cooling increased by 2% to 4%. The cost to the average Indiana household of the DST adoption was determined to be $3.29 per year, for an aggregate cost of $1.7 million to $5.5 million per year.[14]\\r\\nThe United States Chamber of Commerce has praised the extension of daylight's saving under the 2005 law, which increased the amount of shopping and commerce from after work in evenings. In the golf industry, the group has noted exceptional increase in revenue of \\"$200 million in additional sales of golf clubs and greens fees\\".[15] The extension of Daylight's Saving has also had a notable impact on Halloween and candy sales.[16] Wyoming Senator Michael Enzi and Michigan Representative Fred Upton advocated the extension from October into November especially to allow children to go trick-or-treating in more daylight.[17] In some areas, the extension of daylight saving time in March and November has pushed back sunrise to as late as 8:30 am.[16]\\r\\nUnder the Standard Time Act of 1918, as amended by the Uniform Time Act of 1966, moving a state or an area within a state from one time zone to another requires a regulation issued by DOT. The governor or state legislature may initiate a request for the state or any part of the state; the highest elected officials in the county may make a request for that county. The standard in the statute for such decisions is the convenience of commerce in that area. The convenience of commerce is defined broadly to consider such circumstances as the shipment of goods within the community; the origin of television and radio broadcasts; the areas where most residents work, attend school, worship, or receive health care; the location of airports, railway, and bus stations; and the major elements of the community's economy.[7]\\r\\nAfter receiving a request for altering a time zone, DOT determines whether it meets the requirement of minimum statutory criteria before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, soliciting public comment and scheduling a public hearing. Usually the hearing is held in the area requesting the change so that all affected parties can be represented. After the close of the comment period, the comments are reviewed and appropriate final action taken. If the Secretary agrees that the statutory requirement has been met, the change is instituted, usually at the next changeover to or from DST.[7]\\r\\nUnder the Uniform Time Act, moving an area on or off DST is accomplished through legal action at the state level. Some states require legislation while others require executive action such as a governor's executive order. Information on procedures required in a specific state may be obtained from that state's legislature or governor's office. Although it may exempt itself, if a state decides to observe DST, the dates of observance must comply with federal legislation.[7]\\r\\nAlaska observes DST. Due to its high latitude, Alaska has nearly round-the-clock daylight during summer, and DST is seen by some Alaskans as unnecessary and a nuisance. Another issue is that the Alaskan mainland's single time zone, which approximates solar time in the capital, Juneau, leads to a large disparity between civil time and solar time for much of the state, with solar noon occurring as late as 2:10?p.m. in the population centers of Anchorage and Fairbanks, and as late as 3:23?p.m. in places such as Nome. In Fairbanks, for example, sunset occurs well after civil midnight in the summer. Others argue that ending daylight saving time will place Alaska as much as five hours from Eastern Daylight Time, making coordination of travel and phone conversations more difficult.\\r\\nIn March 2015 the Alaska Senate passed a bill, introduced by state senator Anna MacKinnon, to end daylight saving time. The Alaska House formed a sub-committee that was due to look into the issue during the 2016 legislative session.[18]\\r\\nArizona observed DST in 1967 under the Uniform Time Act because the state legislature did not enact an exemption statute that year. In March 1968 the DST exemption statute was enacted and the state of Arizona has not observed DST since 1967. This is in large part due to an effort to conserve energy. Phoenix and Tucson are among the hottest U.S. metropolitan areas during the summer, resulting in more power usage from air conditioning units and evaporative coolers in homes and businesses. An extra hour of sunlight while people are active would cause people to run their cooling systems longer, thereby using more energy.[19]\\r\\nThe Navajo Indian Reservation extends into Utah and New Mexico and does observe daylight saving time.[20] The Hopi Reservation is entirely within the state of Arizona and is an enclave within the Navajo Indian Reservation, but does not observe DST.[21]\\r\\nCalifornia voters passed Proposition 12[22] in 1949, approving DST in the state.[23] In February 2017, California Assembly member Kansen Chu introduced A.B. 807,[24] proposing to enable the legislature to eliminate DST in the state, or, if federal law allows, to adopt DST for the entire year.[25] However, Chu later shelved his bill in September 2017.[26]\\r\\nDaylight saving time is less useful in Florida compared to other states because its southern location leads to less variations in day length between winter and summer. Without DST, Miami, for instance, would experience similar sunrise and sunset times throughout the year to cities including Honolulu or Hong Kong, which have both abandoned DST for decades. There is opposition to DST in Florida.[27] State senator Bill Posey introduced a bill in March 2008 to abolish daylight time in the state and keep Florida on year-round standard time.[28] Because Florida straddles two time zones, the Florida legislature has the option of returning all or part of the state to standard time along time zone boundaries (i.e. placing the portion of the state in the Eastern time zone on standard time, while leaving the portion in the Central time zone on DST, so that the whole state had a common time). There are currently no states that keep daylight saving time year round.\\r\\nOn March 6, 2018, the Florida Senate approved the Sunshine Protection Act which would put Florida on permanent Daylight Saving Time year round, and Governor Rick Scott signed it March 23. Congress would need to amend the existing 1966 federal law to allow the change.[15][29]\\r\\nHawaii has never observed daylight saving time under the Uniform Time Act, having opted out of the Act's provisions in 1967.[30]\\r\\nBecause of Hawaii's tropical latitude, there is not a large variation in daylight length between winter and summer. Advancing the clock in Hawaii would make sunrise times close to 7:00?a.m. even in June.[31] Most of the inhabited islands are located close to the west end of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone, but Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau are located more than 7 degrees west of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone's meridian and should, theoretically, be located in the next time zone to the west. (Until about 1946 Hawaiian standard time was based on longitude 157.5 degrees west rather than 150 degrees.)\\r\\nOn April 26, 1933, the Territorial Legislature enacted a bill placing Hawaii on daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April (April 30 in that year) to the last Sunday in September, but the law was repealed three weeks later on May 21, 1933.[32] During World War II between February 9, 1942 and September 30, 1945, Hawaiian Standard Time was advanced one hour to so-called \\"Hawaiian War Time,\\" effectively placing the territory on year-round daylight saving time.[33]\\r\\nFrom 1970 until 2006, most of Indiana in the Eastern Time Zone did not observe daylight saving time, but the entire state started to do so in April 2006 after eight counties in western Indiana were shifted from the Central Time Zone to the Eastern Time Zone.[34] One goal for observing DST was to get more Indiana counties observing the same time zone; formerly, 77 counties observed EST, 5 observed EST/EDT (the EDT usage being unofficial only), and 10 observed CST/CDT. As of 2016[update], Indiana has 12 counties observing Central Daylight Time while the remaining 80 counties observe Eastern Daylight Time. Those counties observing CST are in two groups: one near or in the Chicago metropolitan area, and the other around Evansville in the southwest corner of the state.\\r\\nIn 1967, the Michigan Legislature adopted a statute, Act 6 of the Public Acts of 1967, exempting the state from the observance of DST. The exemption statute was suspended on June 14, 1967, however, when the referendum was invoked. From June 14, 1967 until the last Sunday in October 1967, Michigan observed DST, and did so in 1968 as well. The exemption statute was submitted to the voters at the General Election held in November 1968, and, in a close vote, the exemption statute was sustained. As a result, Michigan did not observe DST in 1969, 1970, 1971, or 1972. (Radio station CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river from Detroit, was popular on both sides of the border and would often give both times on the air, e.g. \\"It's 4:30 in Detroit and 5:30 in Windsor!\\") In November 1972, an initiative measure, repealing the exemption statute, was approved by the voters. Michigan again observed DST in 1973, and has continued to do so since then.\\r\\nThe vast majority of Michigan is in the Eastern Time Zone. Only the Upper Peninsula counties that border Wisconsin (Gogebic, Iron, Dickinson, and Menominee) are in the Central Time Zone.\\r\\nIn 2015, the Nevada Senate passed Nevada Assembly Joint Resolution 4[35], which urged Congress to enact legislation allowing individual states to establish daylight saving time as the standard time in their respective states throughout the calendar year. This would mean that Nevada is on the same time as Arizona all year, but would be an hour ahead of California in the winter.[36] The United States Congress has not yet enacted any enabling legislation in this regard.\\r\\nIn 2015, Rep. Elizabeth Scott (R-Monroe) filed a House bill to end DST in Washington, and a companion bill was filed in the Senate.[37] She told a House committee that the semiannual time switches are not only inconvenient but lead to health problems and accidents due to lost sleep.[38] She added that the bill to drop daylight saving time would reduce heart attacks, car wrecks, and work accidents found to increase with the sleep-schedule disruptions.[37] A different Senate Bill would petition the federal government for year-round DST.[37] The bills were defeated.[39]\\r\\nAll U.S. insular territories with civilian government (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) lie in the tropics and do not observe DST.\\r\\nWhile neighboring Samoa began observing DST in September 2010, the smaller American Samoa cannot legally follow because of the DST observation period mandated by the Uniform Time Act. This period is actually wintertime in this Southern Hemisphere territory.\\r\\nMany computer operating systems (such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, UNIX, and macOS) and programming languages (such as Java, perl, and most shell languages) allow a local time zone setting in the format of (standard time zone abbreviation)(UTC hour difference)(daylight saving time zone abbreviation). This allows programs and programming languages that must do calculations based on local time to more easily calculate differences between local time and UTC, as well as knowing whether calculations should be changed during daylight saving time. For example, a time zone setting of EST5EDT indicates that local time on the computer is 5 hours behind UTC and should be adjusted for daylight saving time.\\r\\nGeneral topic\\r\\nOfficial civil time distribution\\r\\nQuasi-governmental time distribution systems","input":"What us state does not have daylight savings?"},{"output":"late 1990s","context":"KTM AG (the former KTM Sportmotorcycle AG[3][4]) is an Austrian motorcycle and sports car manufacturer owned by KTM Industries AG and Bajaj Auto.

During the Second World War, his wife took care of the business which was thriving mainly on account of diesel engine repairs.[13]\\r\\nAfter the war, demand for repair works fell sharply and Trunkenpolz started thinking about producing his own motorcycles. The prototype of his first motorcycle, the R100, was built in 1951.[14] The components of the motorcycle were produced in house, except for the Rotax engines which were made by Fichtel & Sachs. Serial production of the R100 started in 1953. With just 20 employees, motorcycles were built at the rate of three per day.[15]\\r\\nIn 1953, businessman Ernst Kronreif became a sizable shareholder of the company which was renamed and registered as Kronreif & Trunkenpolz Mattighofen. In 1954, the R125 Tourist was introduced,[16] followed by the Grand Tourist[17] and the scooter Mirabell[18] in 1955.\\r\\nThe company secured its first racing title in the 1954 Austrian 125cc national championship[19]. In 1956, KTM made its appearance at the International Six Days Trials where Egon Dornauer won a gold medal on a KTM machine[20].\\r\\nIn 1957, KTM built the Trophy 125cc first sports motorcycle[21]. KTM's first moped, called Mecky, was launched in 1957, followed by Ponny I in 1960 and Ponny II in 1962 and Comet in 1963[22]. The 1960s also saw the beginning of the bicycle production in Mattighofen.\\r\\nErnst Kronreif died in 1960[23]. Two years later in 1962,[24] Hans Trunkenpolz also died of a heart attack. His son Erich Trunkenpolz took charge of the company's management.\\r\\nAs the company continued to expand, the workforce totaled 400 in 1971, and forty years after it was founded, KTM was offering 42 different models. Besides, KTM was able to produce motorcycles for the racing industry. During the 1970s and 80s, KTM also started to develop and produce motors and radiators. Radiators sold to European car manufacturers constituted a sizable part of the company's business in the 1980s.[25]\\r\\nIn 1978,[26] US subsidiary KTM North America Inc. was founded in Lorain, Ohio.\\r\\nIn 1980, the company was renamed KTM Motor-Fahrzeugbau KG.[25] One year later, KTM had about 700 employees and a turnover of 750m. Schilling (about 54.5m. Euro). International business then amounted to 76?% of the company turnover.[25]\\r\\nHowever, scooter and moped turnover sank rapidly, and production had to be halted in 1988.[25] Erich Trunkenpolz died in 1989. Takeover of a 51?% interest in the company by the Austrian investment trust GIT Trust Holding controlled by Austrian politician Josef Taus in 1989 was followed by unsuccessful attempts to turn the indebted company around,[27] and in 1991, KTM management was transferred to a consortium of creditor banks.\\r\\nIn 1992, the company was split into four new entities: KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH (motorcycles division), KTM Fahrrad GmbH (bicycles division), KTM Khler GmbH (radiators division) and KTM Werkzeugbau GmbH (tooling division).\\r\\nNow owned by KTM Motorradholding GmbH, which was formed by Cross Holding (a Cross Industries daughter), and other investors, KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH started operation in 1992 and later took over the sibling tooling division KTM Werkzeugbau. In the following years, while steadily increasing production and turnover, investing in new production and R & D facilities,[5][28][29] introducing new models and successfully sponsoring and taking part in various race sport events, the company underwent a series of restructurings and stakeholder changes guided by KTM's managing director and Cross Industries owner Stefan Pierer. In 1994, KTM started production of the Duke series of road motorcycles, in 1996, KTM motocross machines were first decked out in KTM's signature orange color,[30] and 1997 saw the introduction of LC4 Supermoto and Adventure motorcycles. In 2007, the company debuted the KTM X-Bow sports car.[31]\\r\\nIn 1995, KTM Motorradholding GmbH acquired Swedish motorcycle maker Husaberg AB and took control of the Dutch company White Power Suspension.\\r\\nIn 2007, Indian motorcycle manufacturer Bajaj Auto bought a 14.5% stake in KTM Power Sports AG. By 2013, Bajaj Auto held a 47.97% interest in the company.\\r\\nIn 2013, KTM acquired the formerly Swedish motorcycle maker Husqvarna Motorcycles from its prior owner BMW Motorrad AG.[5] The same year, KTM re-integrated the brand Husaberg into Husqvarna Motorcycles from which it had spun off in the 1990s when Husqvarna was sold to the Italian company Cagiva.\\r\\nAs the final result of the restructuring process, KTM Motorradholding GmbH had become KTM AG in 2012. In 2015, KTM generated a turnover of over 1 billion Euro and employed 2515 people by the end of that year.[5] Of the four separate companies left after the 1992 split, three were now again part of the KTM Group: KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH, KTM Werkzeugbau GmbH and KTM Khler GmbH (today WP Radiators). KTM Fahrrad GmbH (KTM Bike Industries) remained an independent company and is owned by Chinese investors. KTM-Group today contains the brands KTM and Husqvarna Motorcycles.\\r\\nKTM AG is presently owned by CROSS KraftFahrZeug Holding GmbH[32] (51,28??%) and Bajaj Auto Limited International Holdings B.V. (47,99?%).[33][5] CROSS KraftFahrZeug Holding GmbH is a subsidiary of KTM Industries AG (prior to 2016 CROSS Industries AG),[34] founded by KTM AGs current CEO Stefan Pierer. KTM Industries AG is owned by Pierer Industrie AG (74,89?%).[35]\\r\\nAs of 2017, KTM AG has the following subsidiaries:\\r\\nFurthermore, KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH and Husqvarna Motorcycles GmbH operate 24 respectively 7 distribution subsidiaries worldwide, most of them in European and Asian countries and in the US.\\r\\nKTM started exporting their GS model to USA in 1968 through an American importer, John Penton under the Penton brand. This Joint Venture lasted until KTM established KTM America Inc. in Ohio in 1978.[36]\\r\\nIn 2005, KTM-Sportmotocycle began a partnership with ATV manufacturer Polaris Industries with the goal of shared R&D, and more importantly shared distribution networks. This partnership was a two-year trial arrangement, at the end of which both parties had the option of merging the two companies into one. In 2006, KTM announced that the partnership with Polaris had been downgraded, and would instead only supply their 450cc and 510cc RFS engines to Polaris.[37]\\r\\nIn January 2008, Bajaj announced that it would jointly develop two new 125cc and 200cc bikes for Europe and the Far East. The bikes would be badged KTM.[38] In January 2012, Bajaj launched the Duke 200 model in India.[39]\\r\\nKTM operates distribution joint ventures in Dubai (KTM UAE), New Zealand (KTM New Zealand), and the Philippines (KTM Philippines).\\r\\nKTM began in motorsports competing in motocross racing. KTM won its first championship in 1974 when Guennady Moisseev claimed the 250cc Motocross World Championship.[40] By the end of 2016, KTM had won more than 260 world championship titles, making the company one of the most successful brands in motorsports. [5] KTM has claimed 96 MXGP, MX1 and MX2 world titles since 1974 and 114 E1, E2, E3 and Super Enduro world titles since 1990. With Ryan Dungey's 2015 and 2016 victories in the supercross world championship, KTM gained a successful presence in supercross racing as well. In 1994, a KTM factory team debuted at the Dakar Rally. In 1998, KTM riders won second to twelfth place. With consecutive wins from 2001 to 2018, the manufacturer has dominated the rally for 17 years now. KTM teams successfully compete in other rally raid events like the Atlas Rally or the Rallye du Maroc. KTM has won 37 cross country rallies world titles since 2003 and has won the FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship 15 times, most recently in 2015.\\r\\nIn 2003, KTM started sponsoring and supporting Road racing in various capacities, with the most successful results stemming from their Supermoto efforts. From 2003 to 2009, a KTM factory team competed in the 125?cc class of the motorcycle Grand Prix, and between 2005 and 2008 in the 250?cc class. Notable successes in the 125?cc class were the second and third place in the overall ranking scored in 2005 by KTM riders Mika Kallio and Gbor Talmcsi, the second place in 2006 by Mika Kallio, the third place in 2007 by Tomoyoshi Koyama and the 2005 KTM victory in the 125?cc constructor championship. In the 250?cc class, Mika Kallio won third place in 2008. Since the first Rookies Cup season in 2007, KTM has supplied the bike for the Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup. In 2009, KTM announced their withdrawal from Grand Prix motorcycle racing in all classes, and did not return until 2012 in the new Moto3 class.\\r\\nIn 2012, KTM won the Moto3 manufacturers' championship. During the next season, KTM riders prevailed in every race of the Moto3 class and won the world title as well as second and third place, making KTM the obvious victor of the manufacturers' standing. KTM won the manufacturer title in the 2014 and 2016 as well as the world title in 2016 in the Moto3 class. Starting in 2017, KTM fields bikes in both MotoGP and Moto2 classes as well. The main class team features Bradley Smith and Pol Espargar܇ as full-season riders, and Mika Kallio as wildcard rider. The Moto2 KTM Ajo team features Miguel Oliveira and Brad Binder.\\r\\nFrom 2009[41] to 2011[42], KTM teams have been competing in the IDM, the Superbike International German Championships. There were speculations about a possible KTM foray[43] into the superbike world championship. Due to the company's focus shifting away from the RC8 and generally superbike design, these plans are off the table for the foreseeable future. [44]\\r\\nKTM's official company/team colours are orange, black and silver. To create a strong brand identity, all competition-ready KTMs come from the factory with bright orange plastic with \\"KTM\\" emblazoned on the side of the radiator shrouds. All KTM bikes also come from the factory with a Motorex sticker on the outside of the motor. All first fills of oil come from Motorex as well. Some official KTM teams use different colors for their bikes, most noticeably in the Dakar Rally.\\r\\nKTM manufactures a wide range of off-road motorcycles. Not all of their models are available in every country. The following section lists bikes that are sold in the US.\\r\\nMotocross ÿ The current Motocross line designated by SX includes 50, 65, 85, 105, 125, 150 and 250?cc single-cylinder two-stroke models (the 50 SX, 65 SX and 85 SX models are kids' and youth bikes), and 250, 350 and 450?cc single-cylinder four-stroke models (SX-F).[45] In 2005 KTM released the new 250SX-F to the general public. Since 2007, the SX-F's have been KTM's new racing motocross range. Current versions of the KTM SX-F line have a dual overhead camshaft engine dubbed the RC4.\\r\\nCross-Country ÿ The current cross-country line designated by XC includes 150, 250 and 300?cc two-stroke models and 250, 350 and 450?cc four-stroke models. The two-stroke XC machines except the 150?cc model are available with either wide-ratio or close-ratio transmission (when switching gears, there is a more or less pronounced rpm change). The four-stroke models are fitted with a semi-close gearbox. Most models are equipped with an electric starter.[46]\\r\\nThe very light weight XC bikes are competition bikes only; they don't meet homologation regulations.\\r\\nEnduro ÿ The street-legal EXC enduro versions of KTM's XC cross-country bikes are supplied with plusher non-linkage suspensions, a wider-ratio gear box and lights.\\r\\nThe current line available in the US consists of 250, 350, 450 and 500 (actually 510 cc) four-stroke EXC models[46] and the 690?cc Enduro R dual-sport motorcycle.\\r\\nFree Ride ÿ A KTM original class of off-road motorcycle that could be described as a cross between enduro and trials bikes. The Freeride 250R is powered by a lighter, modified version of the 250 EXC enduro engine and has a specially developed six-speed gearbox with close transmission ratios in the lower gears and a wide ratio for the sixth gear.[47] A four-stroke 350?cc free ride model with similar characteristics,[48] and the all-electric single-speed models Freeride E-SX, Freeride E-XC as well as their street version Freeride E-SM are available in Europe.[49]\\r\\n450 SX-F\\r\\n350 EXC-F\\r\\nFreeride 250 R\\r\\nFreeride E-XC\\r\\nMotocross\\r\\nMotocross\\r\\nEnduro/ XCountry\\r\\nEnduro/ XCountry\\r\\n(street-legal)\\r\\nE-XC\\r\\n50 SX mini\\r\\n85 SX 19/16\\r\\n250 XC-W\\r\\n250 EXC\\r\\n250 EXC-F\\r\\n300 XC-W\\r\\n300 EXC\\r\\n350 EXC-F\\r\\n450 EXC-F\\r\\nIn the 1990s, AMA rule changes put the cheaper, simpler two-stroke machines at a disadvantage to four-stroke bikes in motocross competitions by limiting two-stroke displacement at 125?cc for the 250?cc class and 250?cc for the 450?cc class.[50] While other manufacturers have decided to discontinue their two-stroke models, KTM has continued with creating and improving their two-stroke machines and has consequently taken up a very high proportion of the two-stroke bike market.\\r\\nNew European emission laws have increased the pressure on two-stroke bikes, as their engines are less fuel efficient and produce more pollution than four-stroke motors. However, with newer advances in technology, two-strokes have begun to burn cleaner and pass stricter green standards. Starting in 2017, all newly registered motorcycles must conform with the Euro 4 regulations for emission management. In May 2017, KTM will unveil a new two-stroke engine with direct fuel injection. By pressure-injecting an electronically controlled amount of fuel into the transfer port of the cylinder, the new TPI (transfer port injection) engines will be more fuel efficient and cleaner than classic carburetor two-stroke engines, albeit more complex and expensive. By 2018, 250 and 300 EXC TPI enduro models will be powered by the new engine. [51]\\r\\nThe first KTM street bike was the Duke 620 in 1994.[52][53][54]\\r\\nSupermoto ÿ KTM was the first manufacturer to offer a competition-ready supermoto bike to the public. However, the company has stopped supermoto production in 2016, selling only stock 690 SMC R machines. The 141 kg light 690 SMC R model has a 48 kW liquid-cooled one-cylinder four-stroke motor (LC4) and a hydraulically actuated APTC slipper clutch.[55]\\r\\nAdventure tourers ÿ KTM currently produces the 1090 Adventure and 1290 Super Adventure dual-sport adventure bikes in versions with different seat height, wheels and suspensions that endow the machines with a road (S), off-road (R ÿ for rally) or touring (T) bias.[56] Not all versions are available on the US market.\\r\\nAdventure and Super Adventure bikes are powered by two-cylinder four-stroke motors (LC8) with a 75 degree cylinder and feature a slipper clutch, electronically controlled riding modes (sport, street and rain) and a twin (analog plus LCD) display.\\r\\nSports tourer ÿ The KTM sports tourer 1290 Superduke GT (Gran Turismo) is a version of the 1290 Superduke R naked bike that has been modified for more touring comfort with a longer and more robust frame, modified handlebar, larger fuel tank and modified two-cylinder four-stroke 75 degree cylinder LC8 motor. Like the 1290 Super Adventure, the 1290 Superduke GT features three electronically controlled riding modes.[57]\\r\\nNaked bikes ÿ With the Duke and Superduke models, KTM currently offers naked bikes with 125, 390, 690 and 1290?cc displacement. The 125 (not available in the US), 390 and 690 and 690 R Duke models have a single-cylinder four-stroke LC4 motor. The 1290 R Superduke model is equipped with a two-cylinder four-stroke 75 degree cylinder LC8 engine.[58]\\r\\n200, 250 and 390 Duke models are currently produced by Bajaj Auto in Pune, India. They are only available in Asia, with only the Duke 390 being exported to European countries.\\r\\nSupersport ÿ KTM sport bikes currently offered in the supersport category include the RC 125 (not available in the US) and the RC 390. Both are street-legal versions of bikes that compete in street races. With the RC16, KTM has presented a 1000?cc sport bike that will race in the MotoGP class of the 2017 Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix.[59] Whether there will be a street-legal production version of the RC16 at a later point in time is yet unclear.\\r\\nIn Asia, KTM also markets RC 200 and RC 250 street bikes.\\r\\nSuperbike ÿ Currently, KTM has retired from superbike production and competitions.[44] From 2008 to 2015, the company produced the 1190 RC8 superbike, a light, powerful homologated (street-legal) bike for superbike competitions with an LC8 motor and without any of the electronic driving aids that the otherwise comparable Superduke and Super Adventure models offer.\\r\\n1290 Super Duke GT\\r\\n1290 Super Adventure R\\r\\n1290 Super Duke R (Special Edition)\\r\\n690 SMC R\\r\\nAdventure Bikes\\r\\nKTM has a series of lightweight, two-seater sports cars known as the X-Bow R, the X-Bow RR, the X-Bow GT and the X-BOW GT4 (currently not produced).[60] The R and GT versions of the X-Bow (pronounced cross-bow) are street-legal in Europe. It uses an Audi engine and a carbon fibre chassis developed in cooperation with Italian racing car manufacturer Dallara, making it the world's first street-legal car with a full carbon fibre monocoque.\\r\\nX-Bow R\\r\\nX-Bow RR\\r\\nX-Bow GT4\\r\\nSince 1992,[61] KTM motorcycles have been designed by KISKA, a Salzburg-based design firm. KISKA also designed four versions of the X-Bow and is responsible for the overall branding for KTM and Husqvarna. This includes the design of the shops, exhibits, web appearances, clothing/merchandise, video and printed material.\\r\\nUnder the Powerparts label, KTM sells tuning and styling parts for its street and off-road motorcycles and the X-Bow.[62] The Powerwear label offers race gear and equipment, clothing, accessories and merchandise articles.[63]","input":"When was the first ktm dirt bike made?"},{"output":"United Kingdom","context":"","input":"Who are the native speakers of english language?"},{"output":"a conference held at Carleton University in Ottawa in 1983","context":"The Green Party of Canada was founded at a conference held at Carleton University in Ottawa in 1983. Under its first leader, Dr. Trevor Hancock, the party ran 60 candidates in the 1984 Canadian federal election.[1][2] The BC Greens ran Canada's first Green candidate. Later that year, the founding conference of the Canadian Greens was held at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario.[1] Close to 200 people from 55 communities attended, coming from every province except Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island.\\r\\nThe birthing process was difficult, with deep divisions between those arguing for a national structure, and those in favour of a process that would build from the regions following the bioregional democracy structure.\\r\\nTrevor Hancock was the party's first registered leader. Party members chose a radically decentralized party structure, and for several years a kind of green anarchism prevailed. Eventually, an uneasy agreement was reached for a federation of regional parties, with strong support for building upwards from the bottom. The question arose: \\"Is the priority to redefine politics from the ground up, or to play the electoral game according to the present rules? Or both?\\"\\r\\nMany members saw the party as a way to protest Canada's political system, and not much more. Nonetheless it did run candidates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Green Party of Canada was registered in 1983 by Paul George, Ted Mousseau, William Marshall, Ed McDonough and Seymour Trieger in June - just preceding a byelection in Mission-Port Moody during which Betty Nickerson ran as a Green Party of Canada candidate. The party had not gained official status at that point so the party name did not appear on the ballot - though it did on all her communications. The first convention in Ontario later that fall elected the next set of party officers. The Green Party of Canada contested its first federal election in September 1984. Approximately 27,000 Canadians voted Green (0.2% of the votes cast). But ongoing discussions about the party's modus operandi became so exhausting that, at one point in the mid-1980s, there was a near collapse of the party. It survived  though not particularly active  for almost a decade under the stewardship of the BC Greens.\\r\\nIn the 1988 federal election, Greens concentrated on Quebec, where le Parti Vert (not the same as the current Parti Vert du Qubec) ran 29 candidates, up from just 4 in the previous election. Les Verts received higher results than Green candidates anywhere else in Canada, polling an average of 2.4% of the vote. The Quebec wing hosted the 1990 Canadian Greens conference in Montreal. But soon after that, Canada's constitutional problems interfered, and many Quebec candidates abandoned the Greens in favour of a Quebec sovereigntist party, the Bloc Qubcois. There were only six Green candidates from Quebec in the 1993 election.\\r\\nIn the summer of 1988, the BC Greens, under the de facto leadership of electoral-reform activist Steve Kisby, tried to get the Green Party of Canada onto its feet by hosting a conference  the first federal gathering since the founding meeting in 1983. The main accomplishment of that conference was the acceptance, after five years as a registered party, of a constitution. The party continued to field candidates at the federal level, and provincial parties were organized in a few other provinces, led by consistently strong efforts in British Columbia.\\r\\nIn 1988, however, despite minimal on-the-ground organization, Quebec produced the lion's share of Green candidates and votes thanks to the efforts of Quebec organizer and candidate Rolf Bramann. A year later, the provincial Greens in Quebec scored 2% of the popular vote, averaging 5% in the constituencies in which they ran under the leadership of Jean Ouimet. Montreal's municipal Ecology Party also scored very well in elections in this period under the leadership of publisher Dimitrios Roussopoulos.\\r\\nOuimet, a strong sovereigntist, maintained a party wholly independent of the federal Greens during his leadership; as a result Bramann created an organization called the Green Party of Canada in Quebec, a predominantly Anglophone entity that nominated federal candidates only. There was open antipathy between Ouimet and Bramann. Neither was affiliated with cologie-Montreal.\\r\\nAt the same time as the Parti Vert began to collapse due to Ouimet's defection to the PQ in 1992, Bramann was removed from his position in the federal party due to anti-Semitic comments he and some of his candidates had made. This led to a precipitous decline in all Green Party organizations in Quebec despite a very promising start a mere four years previous.\\r\\nFrom 1988 onwards, a pattern developed whereby the federal party tended to function alternately as an appendage of the BC and Ontario provincial parties. Lacking sufficient funding and an administrative base of its own, control of the federal Greens was sometimes a prize (when the provincial affiliate and its leader wanted to demonstrate its success), and at others, a burden (when the provincial affiliate was forced to invest significant volunteer energy or money for its maintenance) for the Greens in BC and Ontario. Successful candidates for the positions of Leader and Chief Financial Officer were typically personal associates of either the BC or Ontario party's de facto or de jure leader, for whom the leader publicly mobilized and delivered votes.\\r\\nIn the spring of 1996, although the hopes of electing a representative to the BC legislature proved premature, Andy Shadrack in the interior of the province received over 11% of the vote. Overall, the party's proportion of the popular vote surged to a new high. Shadrack was also the most popular Green candidate in the 1997 federal election, scoring over 6% of the popular vote in West Kootenay-Okanagan.\\r\\nAt the party's sixth annual gathering in Castlegar, British Columbia, hosted by Shadrack's riding association, in August 1996, a complete overhaul of the party's constitution was made, spearheaded by Stuart Parker, leader of the provincial Greens in BC. The party's new constitutional framework both democratized and centralized the party which had been previously hobbled by an unworkably decentralized structure. These changes also ended de jure (it had ended de facto some three years earlier) the constitutional prohibition against the party's registered leader acting as its spokesperson or representative. Policy was also agreed to in a wide variety of areas. An important step forward was the structuring of a Shadow Cabinet, whose mandate was to create a platform for the next election in 1997.\\r\\nThe Castlegar gathering marked the beginning of a new era in Canadian Green history, and a somewhat uneasy one at that. In spite of a concern about the nature of leadership in a decentralized party, the Greens' first leadership campaign had been underway for the previous six months. Four candidates contested the leadership. A mail-in ballot was held: Wendy Priesnitz (from Ontario) beat Don Francis (Quebec), Jason Crummey (Newfoundland and Labrador), and Harry Garfinkle (Alberta) to become the Registered Leader of the Green Party of Canada.\\r\\nIn January 1997, although initially recruited by Ontario Green Party leader Frank de Jong, Wendy Priesnitz resigned over what she characterized as domination of the party by an \\"old boys' network\\" comprising the BC and Ontario provincial leaders and their male-dominated circles of organizers and advisors. Harry Garfinkle stepped in to be the interim Registered Leader of the Green Party of Canada, and a leadership convention by mail-in ballot was held.\\r\\nBritish Columbia's Joan Russow became leader of the Green Party of Canada on April 13, 1997. Russow won 52% of the ballots cast in the 1997 leadership race, surpassing Ontario's Jim Harris (39%) and Rachelle Small (8%). Immediately upon attaining the leadership, Russow was plunged into a federal general election. Russow's campaign in 1997 set a number of important precedents. The 1997 election was the first campaign in which the Greens conducted a national leader's tour, presented a national platform and a bilingual campaign (Russow is trilingual, speaking Spanish, French and English). Previous campaigns, due in part to the party's few resources and, in part, to the party's constitutional straitjacket, had been characterized by policy and spokespeople operating, at best, province-by-province and, at worst, riding-by-riding. In her own riding of Victoria, Russow received just shy of 3000 votes and 6% of the popular vote.\\r\\nIn the 2000 election, the party nominated 111 candidates, in nine out of ten provinces  all but Newfoundland and Labrador  and in one of three territories (Nunavut). These candidates collected 0.81% of the total popular vote.\\r\\nCandidates were not run in Newfoundland and Labrador, as a result of ongoing divisions over Joan Russow's refusal to endorse the Green candidate in an earlier St. John's West by-election. (The candidate in question supported the seal hunt and mining development, as most locals did.) This caused much uncertainty and friction between Newfoundland's Terra Nova Green Party Association and the Green Party leader as the party gradually adapted to the realities of functioning as a true national party rather than a disorganized federation of local activists.\\r\\nIn the 2001 Quebec City protest against the Free Trade Area of the Americas, Russow was the first person incarcerated in a jail built specially for protesters, for taking a photograph of it from outside. Russow promoted the Green Party as a leader in the anti-globalization movement, in particular the anti-corporatist and pro-peace movement, but felt undermined when the German Greens supported the bombing of Belgrade. As other members of her party had supported military intervention, Russow's leadership was called into question. She stepped down as party leader in 2001 and left the party to join the New Democratic Party (NDP). Because the NDP's federal and provincial wings are integrated, this also entailed joining the New Democratic Party of British Columbia.\\r\\nAnother factor in her resignation may have been ongoing conflicts within the party provincially and municipally in her home city of Victoria, where she had switched allegiance from the Parker faction to the Adriane Carr faction. Her late conversion left her on unsure footing with the powerful new provincial leader and in public conflict with City Councilor Art Vanden Berg and other members of the Parker-affiliated team that had backed her leadership during the 1997 and 1998 leadership contests.\\r\\nThe conflicts left Russow isolated and alienated from most members of the party. Volunteer efforts were substantially absorbed in provincial campaigns between 2001 and 2003, and the federal party became dormant between elections, as was typical in the past. Chris Bradshaw served the party as interim leader from 2001 to February 2003.\\r\\nIn February 2003, Jim Harris, in his second bid for the leadership, defeated John Grogan of Valemount, British Columbia, and Jason Crummey. Crummey was originally from Newfoundland and involved with Newfoundland and Labrador Terra Nova Greens. Harris, an author and public speaker, and GPC member since 1987 (though not active in several previous elections), had the support of all provincial Green Party leaders, breaking 15 years of precedent of the BC leader backing a BC candidate from their own political circle. His election was taken by many as reflecting a desire among the members to \\"become serious\\" in achieving electoral progress, and to steer away from any explicit anti-political ideas. However, his campaign also included a hard line against Red-Green (i.e., alliances with NDP members and organized labour) coalitions that Russow had supported at the municipal level in Victoria. While adopting the rhetoric of pragmatism, some argue, Harris eschewed the only strategy that has ever elected Greens under the first-past-the-post system. Harris announced on April 24, 2006, that he would stand down as leader at the party's convention in August.\\r\\nThe Green Party ran a fundraising campaign in 2003 to realize Harris' goal of running a full slate in the upcoming election. This party also had to borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars against the $1.75/vote expected to accrue to the party after the election. The party began organizing in all provinces with paid staff.\\r\\nIn the 2004 election, the party received a significant increase in media coverage on the strength of its 308 candidates, the platform, and a national leaders' tour. The party began to be included in almost all national political polls. Its popular support peaked at 7% during the campaign, and the party finished with 4.3% of the vote. The party's strongest candidate, Andrew Lewis in the riding of SaanichGulf Islands, won over 10,000 votes, the first Green Party candidate to do so. Lewis still finished fourth in the riding, however.\\r\\nIn August 2004 at the national convention near Calgary, Alberta, Jim Harris was re-elected, with a reduced majority of only 56%. Rival Tom Manley polled nearly 37%.\\r\\nMost conference debate centred on significant constitutional reform proposals, and the role of membership in ruling on matters of policy and the constitution. The conference ended with a re-affirmation of a hybrid that was developed during the campaign: a centralized executive with decentralized policy and constitutional development.\\r\\nPoliticians from different political backgrounds have expressed interest in the party. Former Deputy Prime Minister Sheila Copps on March 2, 2005, spoke publicly to a group of Greens in Toronto, advising the party on its electoral strategy. Former Progressive Conservative leadership candidate David Orchard not only attended but met with members of the GPC Council; however, Orchard's involvement with the Greens dates back to the mid-1990s when he worked with Russow on a variety of trade and international issues. (Ontario leader Frank de Jong and BC leader Stuart Parker were featured speakers at pro-Orchard rallies early in his first bid for the Tory leadership in 1998.) It was also rumoured in the media in 2004 that David Anderson, the former Minister of the Environment in Chrtien's government, was considering joining the party. Anderson, however, successfully ran for re-election as a Liberal.\\r\\nNone of the party's candidates were elected, but the party received 4.5% of the vote nationally (up from 4.3% in 2004) and 665,940 votes (an increase of about 80,000 votes from 2004). Its best performance was in Alberta, where it received 6.6%. Sean Maw won 10.84% of the vote in Wild Rose and finished a very distant second to Conservative Myron Thompson. Shane Jolley won 12.9% of the vote in BruceGreyOwen Sound riding, the largest share of the vote won by any of its candidates. In the riding Ottawa Centre, the Green candidate David Chernushenko received 6,766 votes, the largest number of votes of any of the party's candidates. It had been hoped by Greens that the party's deputy leader, Andrew Lewis, would achieve a breakthrough in SaanichGulf Islands where he won 16.7% of the vote in the 2004 election and carried 17 of 238 polling divisions, making Lewis the first Green candidate to win even one polling division. However, running again in SaanichGulf Islands in 2006 he lost one-third of his 2004 vote share, winning only 9.6% of the ballots cast.\\r\\nThe party's 2006 election campaign was disrupted by allegations made by Matthew Pollesell, the party's former assistant national organizer, that Harris had not filed a proper accounting of money spent during his 2004 leadership campaign, as required by law. Pollesell issued a request that Elections Canada investigate. Pollesell and another former party member, Gretchen Schwarz, were subsequently warned by the party's legal counsel to retract allegations they had made or face a possible legal action. Dana Miller, who served in the party's shadow cabinet with responsibility for human-rights issues, made public her earlier complaints that the party has violated election law and its own constitution and has also asked for an Elections Canada investigation. Miller was expelled from the party after filing a complaint within the party in April.[3]\\r\\nElizabeth May was elected leader of the Green Party of Canada in August 2006. She ran in the November 27, 2006 London North Centre by-election, finishing second with 26% of the votes. It was the Green Party's best-ever result in a federal election, easily eclipsing the previous mark of 16.7% achieved in 2004 in the B.C. riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands.\\r\\nIn the 2008 general election, the Green Party's vote was up again to 6.8% and 937,613 votes. On August 30, the former Liberal MP Blair Wilson announces he is joining the Green Party of Canada, becoming the party's first MP and He was defeated in the 2008 federal election, which was called before he had a chance to officially sit in the House of Commons as a Green MP. The best showing was in Elizabeth May's riding of Central Nova where May captured 32.2% of the vote against Conservative cabinet minister Peter MacKay. Part of the reason for May's strong showing is that she brokered a deal with Liberal leader Stphane Dion in which he agreed not to run a Liberal candidate. In return, May agreed not to run a candidate in Dion's riding.\\r\\nBoth for the first time, the leader Elizabeth May became the first Member of Parliament elected to represent the party. She defeated Conservative Incumbent and cabinet minister Gary Lunn.[4]","input":"When was the green party of canada founded?"},{"output":"iPhone 6","context":"The iPhone SE is a smartphone designed and marketed by Apple Inc. as part of the iPhone series of devices. It was unveiled on March 21, 2016, at Apple's Cupertino headquarters, and was released on March 31, 2016. Despite chronologically succeeding the iPhone 6 family's launch, The iPhone SE serves as a successor of the iPhone 5S. It maintains the 4-inch screen size and largely identical design to the 5S, but includes selected hardware upgrades from the larger iPhone 6S model, including its updated processor, rear camera, and support for iOS 10 and iOS 11 software features, such as Apple Pay, always-on Siri activation, and Live Photos. It also features a new color in Rose Gold along with the standard Space Gray, Silver and Gold. The model was re-released with new storage options on March 24, 2017.\\r\\nThe iPhone SE was received positively by critics, who noted its familiar form factor and design, improved hardware over previous 4-inch iPhone models, as well as its overall performance and battery life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous major redesign of the iPhone, the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, resulted in larger screen sizes. However, a significant number of customers preferred the 4-inch screen size of the iPhone 5 and 5S; the 5S was the second-most popular iPhone after the 6, ahead of the 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015. Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as having \\"long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general,\\". The iPhone 5 was described as \\"elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didnt really look like anything else on the market at the time.\\"[3][4]\\r\\nApple's SVP of marketing Phil Schiller stated to Fortune that the \\"SE\\" in its name stood for \\"special edition\\".[5]\\r\\nThe exterior design of the iPhone SE is nearly identical to that of the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5, with the exception of matte-chamfered edges and an inset stainless steel rear Apple logo. Like the iPhone 6S, the iPhone SE is available in space gray, silver, gold and rose gold finishes.[6] Apple stated that cases designed to fit the 5 and the 5S will also fit an iPhone SE, as the three phones have exactly the same dimensions.[7]\\r\\nThe technology specifications of the iPhone SE are similar to the iPhone 6S. This meant that at its launch, the iPhone SE was more powerful than the existing iPhone 6 despite the SE debuting as the entry-level offering while the 6 was the midrange offering in the lineup, which was rectified in September 2016 when the 6 was discontinued and its midrange slot given over to the 6S.[3][8]\\r\\nAs with the 6S, the iPhone SE incorporates the Apple A9 system-on-chip (SoC) with an M9 motion coprocessor and supports near field communication for Apple Pay. The A9 SoC on the iPhone SE outperforms the one on the 6s thanks to the SE's smaller screen and fewer pixels; for comparison, the iPhone SE has a GeekBench score of 2400 on the single core and 4069 on the multi core which compares to the iPhone 6s's score of 2316 on single core and 3922 on multi core. The SE's 4-inch Retina Display at 326 ppi is the same as the preceding 5S.[9] Unlike the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, the SE does not include 3D Touch, nor the updated faster second-generation Touch ID sensor from the 6S and 6S Plus,[9] or its barometer.[10]\\r\\nOn launch, it was released in models with either 16 or 64 GB of internal storage; on March 21, 2017, Apple announced that these models would be replaced by new 32 and 128?GB models at the same launch price points, releasing on March 24, 2017.[11][12]\\r\\nIt features the same 12 megapixel, with pixels 1.22m in size,[13] rear-facing camera as the 6S, with the ability to record 720p at 30 frames per second, for normal video recording and up to 240 fps for slow motion. It also features 1080p at 120 or 60 fps and 4K at 30 fps, as well as faster focus. Despite the upgraded rear camera, it does not feature the same front-facing camera, instead using a 1.2 megapixel sensor with f/2.4 aperture, but benefiting from the improved image signal processor in the A9 chip, and support for the software \\"Retina Flash\\" feature (which allows the display itself to be used as a flash on the front-facing camera).[14][10][15][16][17]\\r\\nIn North America, the iPhone SE comes in two hardware models: the A1662 model sold unlocked by AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, and the A1723 model sold by Sprint or Canadian carriers.[18]\\r\\niPhone SE shipped with iOS 9.3, supporting iPhone 6 and 6S-exclusive features such as Apple Pay, Live Photos, Retina Flash and always-on Siri voice activation.[6][10][16]\\r\\nLauren Goode of The Verge considered the iPhone SE to be \\"a much-improved, well-designed, small phone with great battery life\\" and a \\"kickass upgrade\\" for existing owners of the 4S or 5S models, noting the device's familiar form factor, high performance (going as far as considering the screen size itself to be the only hindrance to multitasking and certain apps), and improved battery life. The camera's quality and functionality were also praised, arguing that the iPhone SE was a \\"completely pocketable and powerful little consumer camera\\" that outperformed other smartphones in its price range. Giving the device an 8.7 out of 10, Goode argued that \\"the iPhone SE is not a tiny little engine of innovation. It's today's tech in yesterday's phone body. As with anything, we should be wary of giving too much praise to something that's just doing its job.\\"[19]\\r\\nCNET was similarly positive, considering the iPhone SE to be a \\"great choice at the small end, with no compromises\\", albeit recommending that purchasers avoid the 16?GB model; the iPhone SE was the last iPhone model that offered 16?GB as its lowest storage capacity; this option was phased out on both the iPhone 7, and later the SE.[20][12] CNET also lauded Apple for accomplishing the task of adapting the 6S's hardware to three different form factors; the smaller SE, 4.7-inch 6S, and 5.5-inch 6S Plus.[20][12] Consequently the iPhone SE is more powerful than the existing iPhone 6 despite the SE debuting as the entry-level offering while the 6 was the midrange offering in the lineup, which was rectified in September 2016 when the 6 was discontinued instead of being moved to entry-level and its midrange slot given over to the 6S. Apple's move to phase out the older iPhone 5S and 6 (along with their A7 and A8 SoC, respectively) earlier, rather than produce them for three years like earlier iPhones, allowed them to simplify their manufacturing and software support.[3][8]","input":"What came first iphone se or iphone 6?"},{"output":"Yuyutsu","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nYuyutsu  (Sanskrit: ????????) in the Hindu epic Mahabharata was a son of Dhritarashtra with  Sughada/Sauvali, his wife Gandhari's maid.

The second population enumeration phase was conducted between 9 and 28 February 2011. Census has been conducted in India since 1872 and 2011 marks the first time biometric information was collected. According to the provisional reports released on 31 March 2011, the Indian population increased to 121 crore with a decadal growth of 17.64%.[2] Adult literacy rate increased to 74.04% with a decadal growth of 9.21%.

A total of 27 lakh officials visited households in 7,935 towns and 6 lakh villages, classifying the population according to gender, religion, education and occupation.[3] The cost of the exercise was approximately ?2,200 crore (US$320?million)[4] ÿ this comes to less than $0.50 per person, well below the estimated world average of $4.60 per person.[3] Conducted every 10 years, this census faced big challenges considering India's vast area and diversity of cultures and opposition from the manpower involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation on castes was included in the census following demands from several ruling coalition leaders including Lalu Prasad Yadav, Sharad Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav supported by opposition parties Bharatiya Janata Party, Akali Dal, Shiv Sena and Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.[5] Information on caste was last collected during the British Raj in 1931. During the early census, people often exaggerated their caste status to garner social status and it is expected that people downgrade it now in the expectation of gaining government benefits.[6] There was speculation that there would be a caste-based census conducted in 2011, the first time for 80 years (last was in 1931), to find the exact population of the \\"Other Backward Classes\\" (OBCs) in India.[7][8][9][10] This was later accepted and the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 was conducted whose first findings were revealed on 3 July 2015 by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.[11] Mandal Commission report of 1980 quoted OBC population at 52%, though National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) survey of 2006 quoted OBC population at 41%[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is only one instance of a caste-count in post-independence India.

It was used in such applications as electrical insulation for hotplate wiring and in building insulation. When asbestos is used for its resistance to fire or heat, the fibers are often mixed with cement or woven into fabric or mats. These desirable properties made asbestos very widely used. Asbestos use continued to grow through most of the 20th century  until public knowledge (acting through courts and legislatures) of the health hazards of asbestos dust outlawed asbestos in mainstream construction and fireproofing in most countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nInhalation of asbestos fibers can cause serious and fatal illnesses including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis (a type of pneumoconiosis).[4][5] Concern of asbestos-related illness in modern times began with the 20th century and escalated during the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1980s and 1990s, asbestos trade and use were heavily restricted, phased out, or banned outright in an increasing number of countries.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the severity of asbestos-related diseases, the material has extremely widespread use in many areas. Continuing long-term use of asbestos after harmful health effects were known or suspected, and the slow emergence of symptoms decades after exposure ceased, made asbestos litigation the longest, most expensive mass tort in U.S. history and a much lesser legal issue in most other countries involved.[7] Asbestos-related liability also remains an ongoing concern for many manufacturers, insurers and reinsurers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsbestos derives from the ancient Greek ?ǚ?, meaning unquenchable or inextinguishable.[1][8][9] The word is pronounced /?s?b?st?s/, /?z?b?st?s/ or /?z?b?st?s/.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix mineral types are defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as \\"asbestos\\" including those belonging to the serpentine class and those belonging to the amphibole class.

Its idealized chemical formula is Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4.[12] Chrysotile appears under the microscope as a white fiber.\\r\\n\\r\\nChrysotile has been used more than any other type and accounts for about 95% of the asbestos found in buildings in America.[13] Chrysotile is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can be spun and woven into fabric. The most common use was corrugated asbestos cement roofing primarily for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found in sheets or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. Chrysotile has been a component in joint compound and some plasters. Numerous other items have been made containing chrysotile including brake linings, fire barriers in fuseboxes, pipe insulation, floor tiles, residential shingles, and gaskets for high temperature equipment.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmphibole class fibers are needle-like. Amosite, crocidolite, tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite are members of the amphibole class.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmosite, CAS No. 12172-73-5, often referred to as brown asbestos, is a trade name for the amphiboles belonging to the cummingtonite-grunerite solid solution series, commonly from South Africa, named as a partial acronym for \\"Asbestos Mines of South Africa\\". One formula given for amosite is Fe7Si8O22(OH)2. Amosite is seen under a microscope as a grey-white vitreous fiber. It is found most frequently as a fire retardant in thermal insulation products, asbestos insulating board and ceiling tiles.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nCrocidolite, CAS No. 12001-28-4, is the fibrous form of the amphibole riebeckite, found primarily in southern Africa, but also in Australia and Bolivia. One formula given for crocidolite is Na2Fe2+3Fe3+2Si8O22(OH)2. Crocidolite is seen under a microscope as a blue fiber.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrocidolite commonly occurs as soft friable fibers. Asbestiform amphibole may also occur as soft friable fibers but some varieties such as amosite are commonly straighter. All forms of asbestos are fibrillar in that they are composed of fibers with breadths less than 1 micrometer in bundles of very great widths. Asbestos with particularly fine fibers is also referred to as \\"amianthus\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOther regulated asbestos minerals, such as tremolite asbestos, CAS No. 77536-68-6, Ca2Mg5Si8O22(OH)2; actinolite asbestos, CAS No. 77536-66-4, Ca2(Mg, Fe)5(Si8O22)(OH)2; and anthophyllite asbestos, CAS No. 77536-67-5, (Mg, Fe)7Si8O22(OH)2; are less commonly used industrially but can still be found in a variety of construction materials and insulation materials and have been used in a few consumer products.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther natural asbestiform minerals, such as richterite, Na(CaNa)(Mg, Fe++)5(Si8O22)(OH)2, and winchite, (CaNa)Mg4(Al, Fe3+)(Si8O22)(OH)2, though not regulated, are said by some to be no less harmful than tremolite, amosite, or crocidolite.[14] They are termed \\"asbestiform\\" rather than asbestos. Although the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not included them in the asbestos standard, NIOSH and the American Thoracic Society have recommended them for inclusion as regulated materials because they may also be hazardous to health.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, about 9% of world's asbestos production was mined in Canada.[15] In late 2011, Canada's remaining two asbestos mines, both located in the Province of Quebec, halted operations.[16] In September 2012, the government in the Province of Quebec halted asbestos mining.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, 2 million tonnes of asbestos were mined worldwide. The Russian Federation was the largest producer with about 55% world share followed by China (20%), Brazil (15.6%), and Kazakhstan (10.8%).[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAsbestos use dates back at least 4,500 years, when the inhabitants of the Lake Juoj?rvi region in East Finland strengthened earthenware pots and cooking utensils with the asbestos mineral anthophyllite (see Asbestos-ceramic).[19] One of the first descriptions of a material that may have been asbestos is in Theophrastus, On Stones, from around 300 BC, although this identification has been questioned.[20] In both modern and ancient Greek, the usual name for the material known in English as \\"asbestos\\" is amiantos (\\"undefiled\\", \\"pure\\"), which was adapted into the French amiante and Portuguese amianto. In modern Greek, the word ?ǚ? or ϫ?? stands consistently and solely for lime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term asbestos is traceable to Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder's manuscript Natural History, and his use of the term asbestinon, meaning \\"unquenchable\\".[1][8][19] While Pliny or his nephew Pliny the Younger is popularly credited with recognising the detrimental effects of asbestos on human beings,[21] examination of the primary sources reveals no support for either claim.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWealthy Persians amazed guests by cleaning a cloth by exposing it to fire. For example, according to Tabari, one of the curious items belonging to Khosrow II Parviz, the great Sassanian king (r. 531ÿ579), was a napkin (Persian: ??????) that he cleaned simply by throwing it into fire. Such cloth is believed to have been made of asbestos imported over the Hindu Kush.[23] According to Biruni in his book, Gems, any cloths made of asbestos (Persian: ???????, zarshost) were called shostakeh (Persian: ??????).[24] Some Persians believed the fiber was the fur of an animal, called the samandar (Persian: ??????), which lived in fire and died when exposed to water,[25][26] which was where the former belief that the salamander could tolerate fire originated.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor (800ÿ814), is said to have had a tablecloth made of asbestos.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarco Polo recounts having been shown, in a place he calls Ghinghin talas, \\"a good vein from which the cloth which we call of salamander, which cannot be burnt if it is thrown into the fire, is made?...\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome archaeologists believe that ancients made shrouds of asbestos, wherein they burned the bodies of their kings, in order to preserve only their ashes, and prevent them being mixed with those of wood or other combustible materials commonly used in funeral pyres.[30][31] Others assert that the ancients used asbestos to make perpetual wicks for sepulchral or other lamps.[25] A famous example is the golden lamp asbestos lychnis, which the sculptor Callimachus made for the Erechtheion.[32] In more recent centuries, asbestos was indeed used for this purpose. Although asbestos causes skin to itch upon contact, ancient literature indicates that it was prescribed for diseases of the skin, and particularly for the itch. It is possible that they used the term asbestos for soapstone, because the two terms have often been confused throughout history.[30][page?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe large scale asbestos industry began in the mid-19th century. Early attempts at producing asbestos paper and cloth in Italy began in the 1850s, but were unsuccessful in creating a market for such products. Canadian samples of asbestos were displayed in London in 1862, and the first companies were formed in England and Scotland to exploit this resource. Asbestos was first used in the manufacture of yarn, and German industrialist Louis Wertheim adopted this process in his factories in Germany.\\r\\n[33] In 1871, the Patent Asbestos Manufacturing Company was established in Glasgow, and within the following decades, the Clydebank area became a centre for the nascent industry.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrial scale mining began in the Thetford hills, Quebec from the 1870s. Sir William Edmond Logan was the first to notice the large deposits of chrysotile in the hills in his capacity as head of Geological Survey of Canada. Samples of the minerals from here were displayed in London, and excited much interest.[33] With the opening up of the Quebec Central Railway in 1876, mining entrepreneurs, such as Andrew Stuart Johnson established the asbestos industry in the province.[35] The 50 ton output of the mines in 1878 rose to over 10,000 tons in the 1890s with the adoption of machine technologies and expanded production.[33][36] For a long time, the world's largest asbestos mine was the Jeffrey mine in the town of Asbestos, Quebec.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAsbestos production began in the Urals of the Russian Empire in the 1880s, and in the Alpine regions of Northern Italy with the formation in Turin of the Italo-English Pure Asbestos Company in 1876, although this was soon swamped by the greater production levels from the Canadian mines. Mining also took off in South Africa from 1893 under the aegis of the British businessman Francis Oates, the Director of the De Beers company.[38] It was in South Africa that the production of amosite began in 1910. The U.S. asbestos industry had an early start in 1858, when fibrous anthophyllite was mined for use as asbestos insulation by the Johns Company, a predecessor to the current Johns Manville, at a quarry at Ward's Hill on Staten Island, New York.[39] US production began in earnest in 1899, with the discovery of large deposits in the Belvidere Mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of asbestos became increasingly widespread towards the end of the 19th century, when its diverse applications included fire retardant coatings, concrete, bricks, pipes and fireplace cement, heat, fire, and acid resistant gaskets, pipe insulation, ceiling insulation, fireproof drywall, flooring, roofing, lawn furniture, and drywall joint compound. In 2011 it was reported that over 50% of UK houses still contained asbestos, despite a ban on asbestos products some years earlier.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Japan, particularly after World War II, asbestos was used in the manufacture of ammonium sulfate for purposes of rice production, sprayed upon the ceilings, iron skeletons, and walls of railroad cars and buildings (during the 1960s), and used for energy efficiency reasons as well. Production of asbestos in Japan peaked in 1974 and went through ups and downs until about 1990, when production began to drop dramatically.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1899, Montague Murray noted the negative health effects of asbestos.[42] The first documented death related to asbestos was in 1906.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1900s researchers began to notice a large number of early deaths and lung problems in asbestos-mining towns. The first such study was conducted by H. Montague Murray at the Charing Cross Hospital, London, in 1900, in which a postmortem investigation of a young man who had died from pulmonary fibrosis after having worked for 14 years in an asbestos textile factory, discovered asbestos traces in the victim's lungs. Adelaide Anderson, the Inspector of Factories in Britain, included asbestos in a list of harmful industrial substances in 1902. Similar investigations were conducted in France and Italy, in 1906 and 1908, respectively.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first diagnosis of asbestosis was made in the UK in 1924.[43][45][46] Nellie Kershaw was employed at Turner Brothers Asbestos in Manchester, England from 1917, spinning raw asbestos fibre into yarn.[46][47] Her death in 1924 led to a formal inquest. Pathologist William Edmund Cooke testified that his examination of the lungs indicated old scarring indicative of a previous, healed, tuberculosis infection, and extensive fibrosis, in which were visible \\"particles of mineral matter?... of various  shapes, but the large majority have sharp angles.\\"[45] Having compared these particles with samples of asbestos dust provided by S. A. Henry, His Majesty's Medical Inspector of Factories, Cooke concluded that they \\"originated from asbestos and were, beyond a reasonable doubt, the  primary cause of the fibrosis of the lungs and therefore of death\\".[46][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of Cooke's paper, parliament commissioned an inquiry into the effects of asbestos dust by E. R. A. Merewether, Medical Inspector of Factories, and C. W. Price, a factory inspector and pioneer of dust monitoring and control.[2] Their subsequent report, Occurrence of Pulmonary Fibrosis & Other Pulmonary Affections in Asbestos Workers, was presented to parliament on 24 March 1930.[49] It concluded that the development of asbestosis was irrefutably linked to the prolonged inhalation of asbestos dust, and included the first health study of asbestos workers, which found that 66% of those employed for 20 years or more suffered from asbestosis.[2] The report led to the publication of the first Asbestos Industry Regulations in 1931, which came into effect on 1 March 1932.[50] These regulated ventilation and made asbestosis an excusable work-related disease.[12] The term mesothelioma was first used in medical literature in 1931; its association with asbestos was first noted sometime in the 1940s. Similar legislation followed in the U.S. about ten years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 100,000 people in the United States have died, or are terminally ill, from asbestos exposure related to ship building. In the Hampton Roads area, a shipbuilding center, mesothelioma occurrence is seven times the national rate.[51] Thousands of tons of asbestos were used in World War II ships to insulate piping, boilers, steam engines, and steam turbines. There were approximately 4.3 million shipyard workers in the United States during WWII; for every 1,000 workers about 14 died of mesothelioma and an unknown number died from asbestosis.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States government and asbestos industry have been criticized for not acting quickly enough to inform the public of dangers, and to reduce public exposure. In the late 1970s, court documents proved that asbestos industry officials knew of asbestos dangers since the 1930s and had concealed them from the public.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia, asbestos was widely used in construction and other industries between 1946 and 1980. From the 1970s there was increasing concern about the dangers of asbestos, and its use was phased out. Mining ceased in 1983. The use of asbestos was phased out in 1989 and banned entirely in December 2003. The dangers of asbestos are now well known in Australia and there is help and support for sufferers from asbestosis or mesothelioma.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nSerpentine minerals have a sheet or layered structure. Chrysotile is the only asbestos mineral in the serpentine group. In the United States, chrysotile has been the most commonly used type of asbestos. According to the U.S. EPA Asbestos Building Inspectors Manual, chrysotile accounts for approximately 95% of asbestos found in buildings in the United States.[citation needed] Chrysotile is often present in a wide variety of products and materials, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the European Union and Australia it has been banned as a potential health hazard[56] and is not used at all. Japan is moving in the same direction, but at a slower pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmphiboles including amosite (brown asbestos) and crocidolite (blue asbestos) were formerly used in many products until the early 1980s.[citation needed] Tremolite asbestos constituted a contaminant of many if not all naturally occurring chrysotile deposits. The use of all types of asbestos in the amphibole group was banned in much of the Western world by the mid-1980s, and in Japan by 1995.[citation needed] Some products that included amphibole types of asbestos included the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nCigarette manufacturer Lorillard (Kent's filtered cigarette) used crocidolite asbestos in its \\"Micronite\\" filter from 1952 to 1956.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile mostly chrysotile asbestos fibers were once used in automobile brake pads, shoes, and clutch discs, contaminants of amphiboles were present. Since approximately the mid-1990s, brake pads, new or replacement, have been manufactured instead with linings made of ceramic, carbon, metallic and aramid fiber (Twaron or Kevlarthe same material used in bulletproof vests).\\r\\n\\r\\nArtificial Christmas snow, known as flocking, was previously made with asbestos.[58] It was used as an effect in films including The Wizard of Oz and department store window displays and it was marketed for use in private homes under  brand names that included \\"Pure White\\", \\"Snow Drift\\" and \\"White Magic\\".[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of asbestos in new construction projects has been banned for health and safety reasons in many developed countries or regions, including the European Union, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and New Zealand. A notable exception is the United States, where asbestos continues to be used in construction such as cement asbestos pipes. The 5th Circuit Court prevented the EPA from banning asbestos in 1991 because EPA research showed the ban would cost between $450 and 800 million while only saving around 200 lives in a 13-year timeframe, and that the EPA did not provide adequate evidence for the safety of alternative products.[60] Until the mid-1980s, small amounts of white asbestos were used in the manufacture of Artex, a decorative stipple finish,[61] however, some of the lesser-known suppliers of Artex were still adding white asbestos until 1999.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the ban, asbestos was widely used in the construction industry in thousands of materials. Some are judged to be more dangerous than others due to the amount of asbestos and the material's friable nature. Sprayed coatings, pipe insulation and Asbestos Insulating Board (AIB) are thought to be the most dangerous due to their high content of asbestos and friable nature. Many older buildings built before the late 1990s contain asbestos. In the United States, there is a minimum standard for asbestos surveys as described by ASTM Standard E 2356ÿ04. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive have issued guidance called HSG264 describing how surveys should be completed although other methods can be used if they can demonstrate they have met the regulations by other means.[63]\\r\\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency includes some but not all asbestos-contaminated facilities on the Superfund National Priorities list (NPL). Renovation and demolition of asbestos-contaminated buildings is subject to EPA NESHAP and OSHA Regulations. Asbestos is not a material covered under CERCLA's innocent purchaser defense. In the UK, the removal and disposal of asbestos and of substances containing it are covered by the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. asbestos consumption hit a peak of 804,000 tons in 1973; world asbestos demand peaked around 1977, with 25 countries producing nearly 4.8 million metric tons annually.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn older buildings (e.g. those built prior to 1999 in the UK, before white asbestos was banned), asbestos may still be present in some areas. Being aware of asbestos locations reduces the risk of disturbing asbestos.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nRemoval of asbestos building components can also remove the fire protection they provide, therefore fire protection substitutes are required for proper fire protection that the asbestos originally provided.[66][67]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome countries, such as India, Indonesia, China, Russia and Brazil, have continued widespread use of asbestos. The most common is corrugated asbestos-cement sheets or \\"A/C sheets\\" for roofing and for side walls. Millions of homes, factories, schools or sheds and shelters continue to use asbestos. Cutting these sheets to size and drilling holes to receive 'J' bolts to help secure the sheets to roof framing is done on-site. There has been no significant change in production and use of A/C sheets in developing countries following the widespread restrictions in developed nations[citation needed]. \\"The largest exporter of asbestos is Russia, which exported 100 million metric tonnes of asbestos.This asbestos is shipped to the nations that still use this cheap and effective building material. China is the number one importer of asbestos, using over five-hundred seventy metric tonnes of the dangerous substance in 2013 alone. China is not the only country that uses asbestos, Russia, Canada, Brazil and India all use asbestos.\\"[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs New York City's World Trade Center collapsed following the September 11 attacks, Lower Manhattan was blanketed in a mixture of building debris and combustible materials. This complex mixture gave rise to the concern that thousands of residents and workers in the area would be exposed to known hazards in the air and in the dust, such as asbestos, lead, glass fibers, and pulverized concrete.[69] More than 1,000 tons of asbestos are thought to have been released into the air following the buildings' destruction.[70] Inhalation of a mixture of asbestos and other toxicants is thought to be linked to the unusually high death rate from cancer of emergency service workers since the disaster.[70] Thousands more are now thought to be at risk of developing cancer due to this exposure with those who have died so far being only the \\"tip of the iceberg\\".[70] Some commentators have criticised authorities for using asbestos in the buildings' construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2002, after numerous cleanup, dust collection, and air monitoring activities were conducted outdoors by EPA, other federal agencies, New York City, and the state of New York, New York City formally requested federal assistance to clean and test residences in the vicinity of the World Trade Center site for airborne asbestos.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nVermiculite is a hydrated laminar magnesium-aluminum-iron silicate which resembles mica. It can be used for many industrial applications and has been used as insulation. Some deposits of vermiculite have been found to be contaminated with small amounts of asbestos.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne vermiculite mine operated by W. R. Grace and Company in Libby, Montana exposed workers and community residents to danger by mining vermiculite contaminated with asbestos, typically richterite, winchite, actinolite or tremolite.[72] Vermiculite contaminated with asbestos from the Libby mine was used as insulation in residential and commercial buildings through Canada and the United States. W. R. Grace and Company's loose-fill vermiculite was marketed as Zonolite but was also used in sprayed-on products such as Monokote.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999 the EPA began cleanup efforts in Libby and now the area is a Superfund cleanup area.[73] The EPA has determined that harmful asbestos is released from the mine as well as through other activities that disturb soil in the area.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nTalc can sometimes be contaminated with asbestos due to the proximity of asbestos ore (usually tremolite) in underground talc deposits.[75] By 1973, US federal law required all talc products to be asbestos-free,[76] and today there is strict quality control in the production of talc products, separating cosmetic-grade talc (e.g. talcum powder) from industrial-grade talc (often used in friction products) has largely eliminated this issue for consumers.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, tests in a certified asbestos-testing laboratory found the tremolite form of amphibole asbestos used to be found in three out of eight popular brands of children's crayons that were made partly from talc: Crayola, Prang, and RoseArt.[78] In Crayola crayons, the tests found asbestos levels around 0.05% in Carnation Pink and 2.86% in Orchid; in Prang crayons, the range was from 0.3% in Periwinkle to 0.54% in Yellow; in Rose Art crayons, it was from 0.03% in Brown to 1.20% in Orange. Overall, 32 different types of crayons from these brands used to contain more than trace amounts of asbestos, and eight others contained trace amounts. The Art and Creative Materials Institute, a trade association which tested the safety of crayons on behalf of the makers, initially insisted the test results must have been incorrect, although they later said they do not test for asbestos.[78] In May 2000, Crayola said tests by Richard Lee, a materials analyst whose testimony on behalf of the asbestos industry has been accepted in lawsuits over 250 times, found its crayons tested negative for asbestos.[79] In spite of that, in June 2000 Binney & Smith, the maker of Crayola, and the other makers agreed to stop using talc in their products, and changed their product formulations in the United States.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mining company, R T Vanderbilt Co of Gouverneur, New York, which supplied the talc to the crayon makers, states that \\"to the best of our knowledge and belief\\" there is no asbestos in its talc.[80] However media reports claim that the United States Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) had found asbestos in four talc samples tested in 2000.[78] The Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health subsequently wrote to the news reporter, stating that \\"In fact, the abbreviation ND (non detect) in the laboratory report ÿ indicates no asbestos fibers actually were found in the samples\\",[81] and multiple studies by both mineral studies laboratories[82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89][90] and biological cell studies[91][92][93] do not report asbestos. These findings have been rejected by other health reports and studies which advocate a \\"same as\\" asbestos risk.[94][95]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll types of asbestos fibers are known to cause serious health hazards in humans.[96][97][98] Amosite and crocidolite are considered the most hazardous asbestos fiber types;[citation needed] however, chrysotile asbestos has also produced tumors in animals and is a recognized cause of asbestosis and malignant mesothelioma in humans,[99] and mesothelioma has been observed in people who were occupationally exposed to chrysotile, family members of the occupationally exposed, and residents who lived close to asbestos factories and mines.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1980s and again in the 1990s it was suggested at times that the process of making asbestos cement could \\"neutralize\\" the asbestos, either via chemical processes or by causing cement to attach to the fibers and changing their physical size; subsequent studies showed that this was untrue, and that decades-old asbestos cement, when broken, releases asbestos fibers identical to those found in nature, with no detectable alteration.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nExposure to asbestos in the form of fibers is always considered dangerous. Working with, or exposure to, material that is friable, or materials or works that could cause release of loose asbestos fibers, is considered high risk. In general, people who become ill from inhaling asbestos have been regularly exposed in a job where they worked directly with the material.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common diseases associated with chronic exposure to asbestos are asbestosis and mesothelioma.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiberglass insulation was invented in 1938 and is now the most commonly used type of insulation material. The safety of this material has also been called into question due to similarities in material structure.[103] However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer removed fiberglass from its list of possible human carcinogens in 2001[104] and a scientific review article from 2011 claimed epidemiology data was inconsistent and concluded that the IARC's decision to downgrade the carcinogenic potential of fiberglass was valid (however, this study was funded by sponsored research contract from the North American Insulation Manufacturers Association).[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1978, a highly texturized fiberglass fabric was invented by Bal Dixit, called Zetex. This fabric is lighter than asbestos, but offers the same bulk, thickness, hand, feel, and abrasion resistance as asbestos. The fiberglass was texturized to eliminate some of the problems that arise with fiberglass, such as poor abrasion resistance and poor seam strength.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Europe, mineral wool and glass wool are the main insulators in houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany companies that produced asbestos-cement products that were reinforced with asbestos fibers have developed products incorporating organic fibers. One such product was known as \\"Eternit\\" and another \\"Everite\\" now use \\"Nutec\\" fibers which consist of organic fibers, portland cement and silica. Cement-bonded wood fiber is another substitute. Stone fibers are used in gaskets and friction materials.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother potential fiber is polybenzimidazole or PBI fiber. Polybenzimidazole fiber is a synthetic fiber with a high melting point of 760?C (1,400?F) that also does not ignite. Because of its exceptional thermal and chemical stability, it is often used by fire departments and space agencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsbestos alternatives for industrial use include sleeves, rope, tape, fabric, textiles and insulation batt materials made from fiberglass and silica.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most developed countries, asbestos is typically disposed of as hazardous waste in landfill sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe demolition of buildings containing large amounts of asbestos based materials pose particular problems for builders and property developers ÿ such buildings often have to be deconstructed piece by piece, or the asbestos has to be painstakingly removed before the structure can be razed by mechanical or explosive means. One such example is the Red Road Flats in Glasgow, Scotland which used huge amounts of asbestos cement board for wall panelling ÿ here British health and safety regulations stipulate that asbestos material has to be removed to a landfill site via an approved route at certain times of the day in specially adapted vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsbestos can be recycled by transforming it into harmless silicate glass. A process of thermal decomposition at 1000ÿ1250?C produces a mixture of non-hazardous silicate phases, and at temperatures above 1250?C it produces silicate glass.[107] Microwave thermal treatment can be used in an industrial manufacturing process to transform asbestos and asbestos-containing waste into porcelain stoneware tiles, porous single-fired wall tiles, and ceramic bricks.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe combination of oxalic acid with ultrasound fully degrades chrysotile asbestos fibers.[109]","input":"When was asbestos first found to be dangerous?"},{"output":"Guys 'n' Dolls","context":"Guys 'n' Dolls were a UK pop group made up of a three girl/three boy line-up. In the mid-1970s, they scored UK top ten hits with the singles \\"There's a Whole Lot of Loving\\" and \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\".[1] They found further success in Holland in the late 1970s where they had a number one hit with \\"You're My World\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGuys 'n' Dolls were formed in November 1974, after Ammo Productions held auditions for three young men and three young women to perform as a vocal group. The six original members were: Paul Griggs, David Van Day, Dominic Grant, Thereza Bazar, Martine Howard, and Julie Forsyth (daughter of Sir Bruce Forsyth).\\r\\nGuys 'n' Dolls released their first hit single, \\"There's a Whole Lot of Loving\\" in January 1975. The song was originally recorded in September 1974 by a group of session singers (including Tony Burrows and Clare Torry) for a TV advertisement for McVitie's biscuits. Guys 'n' Dolls were put together to cash in upon the popularity of the jingle and to present it as a single. However the group was not ready in time to record an entirely new version for the single's hasty release and so the voices of the session singers remained on the single.[2][3] The song became an immediate hit, rising to No.2 in the UK singles chart, launching the group to overnight stardom.[4]\\r\\nThe following year, the group scored highly again as their cover of \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\" peaked at No.5. Other singles by the group charted more modestly and they only charted one album, 1975's Guys 'n' Dolls.[4] In 1977 however, they scored a No.1 hit in both the Netherlands and Belgium with \\"You're My World\\", launching them on a new phase of their career. [5]\\r\\nBy mid 1977, Van Day and Bazar were complaining about the direction of the group to the point that the management asked them to leave. As agreed with them however, publicity at the time showed that leaving the group was their own decision to concentrate on songwriting.[6] The pair did go on to form the duo Dollar, who went on to score several hits in the late 1970s and 1980s. Guys 'n' Dolls continued as a quartet, with their third album Together (1977) depicting just the four remaining members. The group scored a final minor hit in the UK in 1978, and after failing to renew their contract with Magnet Records, they concentrated on their success in Holland, where they continued having hits for the next few years. In late 1978, the group performed as the opening act for Frank Sinatra for a series of London concerts.[6]\\r\\nIn 1979, the group took part in the A Song For Europe contest, hoping to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"How Do You Mend a Broken Heart?\\" Although the show was abandoned due to a BBC strike, the song finished in tenth place of the 12 entries when the judges cast votes on the audio recordings of the songs.[7]\\r\\nIn 1980, Forsyth and Grant had their first child together, plus Martine Howard and the Guys 'n' Dolls Dutch record producer Gerard Stellaard got married and moved to the Netherlands. After marrying, Martine Howard left the group, and was replaced by Forsyth's younger sister, Laura early in 1981. The change was short-lived, when she was replaced by Rosie Hetherington, who had previously been a part of the dance troupe Legs & Co.[8]\\r\\nGuys 'n' Dolls finished as a unit in December 1985, having spent eleven years together. Grant and Forsyth, performed as the duo Grant & Forsyth, and had another five hits in the Netherlands.[9] In 1988, Forsyth wrote the UK's Eurovision Song Contest entry \\"Go\\" performed by Scott Fitzgerald. Both Forsyth and Grant, together with ex-Jigsaw member Des Dyer, sang backing vocals for the song's performance at the contest in Dublin, Ireland. The song finished second by a margin of one point behind Celine Dion's song for Switzerland, making it the closest ever run contest.[10]\\r\\nThe original line up of Guys 'n' Dolls, (Grant, Forsyth, Griggs, Howard, Van Day and Bazar) reunited for the first time in thirty one years for a major television show in the Netherlands on 22 March 2008.[11] This was preceded on Friday 21 March by a day of press and TV interviews.\\r\\nGriggs has published a book called Diary of a Musician, based on diaries he kept from 1960.

This discovery aided the reignition of archaeological exploration for the Vikings in the north Atlantic.[2]\\r\\nThe Norse colony in Greenland lasted for almost 500 years. Continental North American settlements were small and did not develop into permanent colonies. While voyages, for example to collect timber, are likely to have occurred for some time, there is no evidence of any lasting Norse settlements on mainland North America.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Sagas of Icelanders, Norsemen from Iceland first settled Greenland in the 980s. There is no special reason to doubt the authority of the information that the sagas supply regarding the very beginning of the settlement, but they cannot be treated as primary evidence for the history of Norse Greenland because they embody the literary preoccupations of writers and audiences in medieval Iceland that are not always reliable.[4]\\r\\nErik the Red (Old Norse: Eirkr rauei), having been banished from Iceland for manslaughter, explored the uninhabited southwestern coast of Greenland during the three years of his banishment.[5][6] He made plans to entice settlers to the area, naming it Greenland on the assumption that \\"people would be more eager to go there because the land had a good name\\".[7] The inner reaches of one long fjord, named Eiriksfjord after him, was where he eventually established his estate Brattahlid. He issued tracts of land to his followers.[8]\\r\\nAt its peak the colony consisted of two settlements. The Eastern was at the southwestern tip of Greenland, while the Western Settlement was about 500?km up the west coast, inland from present-day Nuuk. A smaller settlement near the Eastern Settlement is sometimes considered the Middle Settlement. The combined population was around 2,000ÿ3,000.[9] At least 400 farms have been identified by archaeologists.[8] Norse Greenland had a bishopric (at Garear) and exported walrus ivory, furs, rope, sheep, whale or seal blubber, live animals such as polar bears, supposed \\"unicorn horns\\" (in reality narwhal tusks), and cattle hides. In 1126, the population requested a Bishop (headquartered at Garear), and in 1261, they accepted the overlordship of the Norwegian King. They continued to have their own law and became almost completely independent after 1349, the time of the Black Death. In 1380, the Norwegian Kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark.[10]\\r\\nThere is evidence of Norse trade with the natives (called Skraelings by the Vikings). The Norse would have encountered both Native Americans (the Beothuk, related to the Algonquin) and the Thule, the ancestors of the Inuit. The Dorset had withdrawn from Greenland before the Norse settlement of the island. Items such as comb fragments, pieces of iron cooking utensils and chisels, chess pieces, ship rivets, carpenter's planes, and oaken ship fragments used in Inuit boats have been found far beyond the traditional range of Norse colonization. A small ivory statue that appears to represent a European has also been found among the ruins of an Inuit community house.[10]\\r\\nThe colony began to decline in the 14th century. The Western Settlement was abandoned around 1350, and the last bishop at Garear died in 1377.[10] After a marriage was recorded in 1408, no written records mention the settlers. It is probable that the Eastern Settlement was defunct by the late 15th century. The most recent radiocarbon date found in Norse settlements as of 2002 was 1430 (I15 years). Several theories have been advanced to explain the decline.\\r\\nThe Little Ice Age of this period would have made travel between Greenland and Europe, as well as farming, more difficult; although fishing and seal hunting provided a healthy diet, there was more prestige in cattle farming, and there was increased availability of farms in Scandinavian countries depopulated by famine and plague epidemics. In addition, Greenlandic ivory may have been supplanted in European markets by cheaper ivory from Africa.[11] Despite the loss of contact with the Greenlanders, the Norwegian-Danish crown continued to consider Greenland a possession.\\r\\nNot knowing whether the old Norse civilization remained in Greenland or notand worried that if it did, it would still be Catholic 200 years after the Scandinavian homelands had experienced the Reformationa joint merchant-clerical expedition led by the Dano-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede was sent to Greenland in 1721. Though this expedition found no surviving Europeans, it marked the beginning of Denmark's re-assertion of sovereignty over the island.\\r\\nAccording to the Icelandic sagasEirik the Red's Saga,[12] Saga of the Greenlanders, plus chapters of the Hauksb܇k and the Flatey Bookthe Norse started to explore lands to the west of Greenland only a few years after the Greenland settlements were established. In 985 while sailing from Iceland to Greenland with a migration fleet consisting of 400ÿ700 settlers[8][13] and 25 other ships (14 of which completed the journey), a merchant named Bjarni Herj܇lfsson was blown off course, and after three days' sailing he sighted land west of the fleet. Bjarni was only interested in finding his father's farm, but he described his discovery to Leif Erikson who explored the area in more detail and planted a small settlement fifteen years later.[8]\\r\\nThe sagas describe three separate areas discovered during this exploration: Helluland, which means \\"land of the flat stones\\"; Markland, \\"the land of forests\\", definitely of interest to settlers in Greenland where there were few trees; and Vinland, \\"the land of wine\\", found somewhere south of Markland. It was in Vinland that the settlement described in the sagas was founded.\\r\\nThree of Erik the Red's children visited the North American continent: his sons Leif and Thorvald, and their sister (or half-sister) Freydis. Thorvald died there.\\r\\nUsing the routes, landmarks, currents, rocks, and winds that Bjarni had described to him, Leif sailed some 1,800 miles to the west of the land, with a crew of 35sailing the same knarr Bjarni had used to make the voyage. He described Helluland as \\"level and wooded, with broad white beaches wherever they went and a gently sloping shoreline.\\"[8] Leif and others had wanted his father, Erik the Red, to lead this expedition and talked him into it. However, as Erik attempted to join his son Leif on the voyage towards these new lands, he fell off his horse as it slipped on the wet rocks near the shore; thus he was injured and stayed behind.[8]\\r\\nLeif wintered in 1001, probably near Cape Bauld on the northern tip of Newfoundland, where one day his foster father Tyrker was found drunk, on what the saga describes as \\"wine-berries.\\" Squashberries, gooseberries, and cranberries all grew wild in the area. There are varying explanations for Leif apparently describing fermented berries as \\"wine.\\"\\r\\nLeif spent another winter at \\"Leifsb~eir\\" without conflict, and sailed back to Brattahle in Greenland to assume filial duties to his father.\\r\\nIn 1004, Leif's brother Thorvald Eiriksson sailed with a crew of 30 men to Vinland and spent the following winter at Leif's camp. In the spring, Thorvald attacked nine of the local people who were sleeping under three skin-covered canoes. The ninth victim escaped and soon came back to the Norse camp with a force. Thorvald was killed by an arrow that succeeded in passing through the barricade. Although brief hostilities ensued, the Norse explorers stayed another winter and left the following spring. Subsequently, another of Leif's brothers, Thorstein, sailed to the New World to retrieve his dead brother's body, but he died before leaving Greenland.[8]\\r\\nIn 1009 Thorfinn Karlsefni, also known as \\"Thorfinn the Valiant\\", supplied three ships with livestock and 160 men and women[13] (although another source sets the number of settlers at 250). After a cruel winter, he headed south and landed at Straumfjord. He later moved to Straums?y, possibly because the current was stronger there. A sign of peaceful relations between the indigenous peoples and the Norsemen is noted here. The two sides bartered with furs and gray squirrel skins for milk and red cloth, which the natives tied around their heads as a sort of headdress.\\r\\nThere are conflicting stories but one account states that a bull belonging to Karlsefni came storming out of the wood, so frightening the natives that they ran to their skin-boats and rowed away. They returned three days later, in force. The natives used catapults, hoisting \\"a large sphere on a pole; it was dark blue in color\\" and about the size of a sheep's belly,[14] which flew over the heads of the men and made an ugly din.[14]\\r\\nThe Norsemen retreated. Leif Erikson's half-sister Freyds Eirksd܇ttir was pregnant and unable to keep up with the retreating Norsemen. She called out to them to stop fleeing from \\"such pitiful wretches\\", adding that if she had weapons, she could do better than that. Freyds seized the sword belonging to a man who had been killed by the natives. She pulled one of her breasts out of her bodice and struck it with the sword, frightening the natives, who fled.[14]\\r\\nPurported runestones have been found in North America, most famously the Kensington Runestone. These are generally considered to be hoaxes or misinterpretations of Native American petroglyphs.[15]\\r\\nThere are many claims of Norse colonization in New England, none well-founded.\\r\\nMonuments claimed to be Norse include:[16]\\r\\nThe nineteenth-century Harvard chemist Eben Norton Horsford connected the Charles River Basin to places described in the Norse sagas and elsewhere, notably Norumbega.[17] He published several books on the topic and had plaques, monuments, and statues erected in honor of the Norse.[18] His work received little support from mainstream historians and archeologists at the time, and even less today.[19][20][21]\\r\\nSettlements in continental North America aimed to exploit natural resources such as furs and in particular lumber, which was in short supply in Greenland.[22] It is unclear why the short-term settlements did not become permanent, though it was likely in part because of hostile relations with the indigenous peoples, referred to as Skr?lings by the Norse.[23] Nevertheless, it appears that sporadic voyages to Markland for forages, timber, and trade with the locals could have lasted as long as 400 years.[24][25]\\r\\nEvidence of continuing trips includes the Maine Penny, a Norwegian coin from King Olaf Kyrre's reign (1067ÿ1093) allegedly found in a Native American archaeological site in the U.S. state of Maine, suggesting an exchange between the Norse and the Native Americans late in or after the 11th century; and an entry in the Icelandic Annals from 1347 which refers to a small Greenlandic vessel with a crew of eighteen that arrived in Iceland while attempting to return to Greenland from Markland with a load of timber.[26]\\r\\nFor centuries it remained unclear whether the Icelandic stories represented real voyages by the Norse to North America. The sagas first gained serious historic respectability when, in 1837, the Danish antiquarian Carl Christian Rafn pointed out the possibility for a Norse settlement in, or voyages to, North America. North America, by the name Winland, first appeared in written sources in a work by Adam of Bremen from approximately 1075. The most important works about North America and the early Norse activities there, namely the Sagas of Icelanders, first reached written form only in the 13th and 14th centuries.[citation needed]\\r\\nEvidence of Norse west of Greenland came in the 1960s when archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad and her husband, outdoorsman and author Helge Ingstad, excavated a Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland. The location of the various lands described in the sagas remains unclear, however. Many historians identify Helluland with Baffin Island and Markland with Labrador. The location of Vinland poses a thornier question. Most believe that the L'Anse aux Meadows settlement represents the Vinland settlement described in the sagas; others argue that the sagas depict Vinland as warmer than Newfoundland and therefore lying farther south.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2012 Canadian researchers identified possible signs of Norse outposts in Nanook at Tanfield Valley on Baffin Island, as well as on Nunguvik, Willows Island and Avayalik.[27][28][29] Unusual fabric cordage found on Baffin Island in the 1980s and stored at the Canadian Museum of Civilization was identified in 1999 as possibly of Norse manufacture; that discovery led to more in-depth exploration of the Tanfield Valley archaeological site.[citation needed]\\r\\nArcheological findings in 2015 at Point Rosee, on the southwest coast of Newfoundland, reveal evidence of the location being a bog iron-smelting site and therefore a possible second 10th century Viking settlement in Canada. The possible settlement was initially discovered through satellite imagery and magnetometer readings and archaeologists have begun excavating the area.[30][31]\\r\\nThe Sklholt Map, made by an Icelandic teacher in 1570, depicts part of north-eastern North America mentioning Helluland, Markland and Vinland.[32]","input":"Where did vikings first land in north america?"},{"output":"a field grade military officer rank just above the rank of major and just below the rank of colonel","context":"In the United States Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Air Force, a lieutenant colonel is a field grade military officer rank just above the rank of major and just below the rank of colonel.

In the United States armed forces, the insignia for the rank consists of a silver oak leaf, with slight stylized differences between the Army/Air Force version and the Navy/Marine Corps version.\\r\\nPromotion to lieutenant colonel is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) of 1980 for officers in the Active Component and its companion Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA) for officers in the Reserve Component (e.g., Reserve and National Guard).

Since the British colonel was not a \\"combat\\" officer, beginning in May 1778 to simplify prisoner of war exchanges, American regiments began to eliminate colonels by attrition and replace them with a lieutenant colonel commandant. The conversion was never completely effected and some regiments remained commanded by colonels throughout the war.[7] From 1784 until 1791, there was only one lieutenant colonel in the US Army (Josiah Harmar), who acted as the army's commanding officer.\\r\\nIn the Continental Army aides to the Commander in Chief, viz., Lieutenant General George Washington, were lieutenant colonels. Additionally, certain officers serving under the Adjutant General, Inspector General, and Judge Advocate General, ranked as lieutenant colonels.[8]\\r\\nDuring the 19th century, lieutenant colonel was often a terminal rank for many officers, since the rank of \\"full colonel\\" was considered extremely prestigious reserved only for the most successful officers. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, the rank of lieutenant colonel became much more common and was used as a \\"stepping stone\\" for officers who commanded small regiments or battalions and were expected, by default, to be promoted to full colonel once the manpower of a regiment grew in strength. Such was the case of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who commanded a Maine regiment as both a lieutenant colonel and later as a colonel.\\r\\nAfter the Civil War ended, those officers remaining in the United States Armed Forces found lieutenant colonel to again be a terminal rank, although many lieutenant colonels were raised to higher positions in a brevet status. Such was the case with George A. Custer, who was a lieutenant colonel in the regular army, but held the brevet rank of major general.[9][10]\\r\\nThe 20th century saw lieutenant colonel in its present-day status although, during the 1930s, many officers again found the rank to be terminal as the rank of colonel was reserved for only a select few officers.\\r\\nIn the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps (USMC), a lieutenant colonel typically commands a battalion/squadron-sized unit (300 to 1,200 Soldiers/Marines), with a major as executive officer (XO) and a command sergeant major/sergeant major (USMC) as principal NCO or senior enlisted adviser (SEA). A lieutenant colonel may also serve as a brigade/brigade combat team, regiment/regimental combat team, Marine Aviation Group (MAG), Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), or battalion task force executive officer. Lieutenant colonels routinely serve as principal staff officers, under a colonel as chief of staff, on a general staff (\\"G\\" staff) of a division, Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), or Marine Logistics Group (MLG). These staff positions may include: G-1 (administration and personnel), G-2 (intelligence), G-3 (operations), G-4 (logistics), G-5 (civil/military affairs), or G-6 (computers and communications). Usage of \\"The G-n\\" may refer to either a specific staff section or the staff officer leading a section. Lieutenant colonels may also be junior staff at a variety of higher echelons.\\r\\nIn the United States Air Force, a lieutenant colonel is generally a squadron commander in the operations group, mission support and maintenance groups, or a squadron commander or division chief in a medical group. Lieutenant colonels may also serve on general staffs and may be the heads of some wing staff departments. Senior Lieutenant colonels occasionally serve as group commanders.\\r\\nIn US Army and Air Force ROTC detachments, the commanding officer is typically a lieutenant colonel, along with several majors, captains, and non-commissioned officers serving as assistants. However, some detachments are commanded by full colonels.\\r\\nThe rank of lieutenant colonel is also used by many large American police departments for officers in senior administrative positions. The rank is not always called \\"lieutenant colonel,\\" and in many cases ÿ particularly with municipal police agencies ÿ an alternate term such as \\"assistant chief\\" or \\"commander\\" is used, and only the insignia is retained. In some organizations, however, especially state police agencies, both the title and insignia are used. Occasionally, the rank is used in conjunction with, rather than instead of, an official title. For example, in the Texas Department of Public Safety, the head of the agency's patrol division is titled \\"Chief of the Highway Patrol\\", but holds the rank of a lieutenant colonel: this figure is thus referred to as \\"lieutenant colonel,\\" not \\"chief\\".","input":"What rank is lieutenant colonel in the marines?"},{"output":"the Bible","context":"This page provides lists of best-selling individual books and book series to date and in any language. \\"Best selling\\" refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned.

Many of the saints are often depicted with a lily, most prominently St. Joseph. Since France is a historically Catholic nation, the Fleur de lis became commonly used \\"at one and the same time, religious, political, dynastic, artistic, emblematic, and symbolic\\", especially in French heraldry.[4]\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis is represented in Unicode at U+269C (?) in the Miscellaneous Symbols block.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the fleur-de-lis has appeared on countless European coats of arms and flags over the centuries, it is particularly associated with the French monarchy in a historical context, and continues to appear in the arms of the King of Spain (from the French House of Bourbon) and the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and members of the House of Bourbon. It remains an enduring symbol of France that appears on French postage stamps, although it has never been adopted officially by any of the French republics. According to French historian Georges Duby, the three petals represent the medieval social classes: those who worked, those who fought, and those who prayed.[5]\\r\\nIt is unclear where the fleur-de-lis originated. Among the Egyptians, Persians, Arabs and Greeks, this arabesque evoked warrior-like power. In France it is widely used in city emblems like in the coat of arms of the city of Lille, Saint-Denis, Brest, Clermont-Ferrand, Boulogne-Billancourt and Calais. Some cities that had been particularly faithful to the Crown were awarded an heraldic augmentation of two or three fleurs-de-lis on the chief of their coat of arms; such cities include Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Reims, Le Havre, Angers, Le Mans, Aix-en-Provence, Tours, Limoges, Amiens, Orlans, Rouen, Argenteuil, Poitiers, Chartres and Laon among others. The fleur-de-lis was the symbol of ?le-de-France, the core of the French kingdom. It appeared on the coat-of-arms of other historical provinces of France, like Burgundy, Anjou, Picardy, Berry, Orlanais, Bourbonnais, Maine, Touraine, Artois, Dauphin, Saintonge and the County of La Marche. Many of the current departments use the ancient symbol on their coats to express this heritage.\\r\\n In Italy, the fleur de lis, called giglio is mainly known as the crest of the city of Florence. In the Florentine fleurs-de-lis,[f] the stamens are always posed between the petals. Originally argent (silver or white) on gules (red) background, the emblem became the standard of the imperial party in Florence (parte ghibellina), causing the town government, which maintained a staunch Guelph stance, being strongly opposed to the imperial pretensions on city states, to reverse the color pattern to the final gules lily on argent background.[6] This heraldic charge is often known as the Florentine lily to distinguish it from the conventional (stamen-not-shown) design. As an emblem of the city, it is therefore found in icons of Zenobius, its first bishop,[7] and associated with Florence's patron Saint John the Baptist in the Florentine fiorino. Several towns subjugated by Florence or founded within the territory of the Florentine Republic adopted a variation of the Florentine lily in their crests, often without the stamens.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe heraldic fleur-de-lis is still widespread: among the numerous cities which use it as a symbol are some whose names echo the word 'lily', for example, Liljendal, Finland, and Lelystad, Netherlands. This is called canting arms in heraldic terminology. Other European examples of municipal coats-of-arms bearing the fleur-de-lis include Lincoln in England, Morcn in Spain, Wiesbaden in Germany, Skierniewice in Poland and Jurbarkas in Lithuania. The Swiss municipality of Schlieren and the Estonian municipality of J?el?htme also have a fleur-de-lis on their coats.\\r\\nIn Malta, the town of Santa Venera has three red fleurs-de-lis on its flag and coat of arms. These are derived from an arch which was part of the Wignacourt Aqueduct that had three sculpted fleurs-de-lis on top, as they were the heraldic symbols of Alof de Wignacourt, the Grand Master who financed its building. Another suburb which developed around the area became known as Fleur-de-Lys, and it also features a red fleur-de-lis on its flag and coat of arms.[8]\\r\\nThe coat of arms of the medieval Kingdom of Bosnia contained six fleurs-de-lis, understood as the native Bosnian or Golden Lily, Lilium bosniacum.[9] This emblem was revived in 1992 as a national symbol of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and was the flag of Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1992 to 1998.[10] The state insignia were changed in 1999. The former flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina contains a fleur-de-lis alongside the Croatian chequy. Fleurs also appear in the flags and arms of many cantons, municipalities, cities and towns. It is still used as official insignia of the Bosniak Regiment of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.[11]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, a fleur-de-lis has appeared in the official arms of the Norroy King of Arms for hundreds of years. A silver fleur-de-lis on a blue background is the arms of the Barons Digby.[12]\\r\\nIn English and Canadian heraldry the fleur-de-lis is the cadence mark of a sixth son.[13]\\r\\nIn Mauritius, slaves were branded with a fleur-de-lis, when being punished for escaping or stealing food.[14]\\r\\nThe Welsh poet Hedd Wyn used Fleur de Lys as his pen name when he won his chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales (Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru), the national poetry contest.\\r\\nFleurs-de-lis appear on military insignia and the logos of many organizations. During the 20th century the symbol was adopted by various Scouting organizations worldwide for their badges. Architects and designers use it alone and as a repeated motif in a wide range of contexts, from ironwork to bookbinding, especially where a French context is implied.\\r\\nThe symbol is also often used on a compass rose to mark the north direction, a tradition started by Pedro Reinel. The dark code was an arrangement of controls received in Louisiana in 1724 from other French settlements around the globe, intended to represent the state's slave populace. Those guidelines included marking slaves with the fleur-de-lis as discipline for fleeing.[15]\\r\\nThe Dorje Arhats who were known among the Indo-European Kingdoms and territories of ?ang?ung, Tokaria, Kotan, Sparia, ?aka, Sarmatia, White Croatia and White Serbia were called by the Sarmatians and Slavs Dzier?o[citation needed] and their ritual ?or?e, Dzier?o[citation needed] became the coat of arms of Pilzno, Nowotaniec and some other settlements - its later derivate, the Piernacz (Perna?) was used since the 12th century in Poland and Kievan Rus'.\\r\\n?or?e-Dzier?o of White Serbia[citation needed] was known to western chroniclers of the earty 7th century as Dervan, Derwan, Der[16][17] and his capital was Mi?no[citation needed].

This development was supported by Wynfryth of Wessex, since whose time the official use of the White-Red (Brahmini-K?atriya[citation needed]) flags and the ancient Sudar?ana ?akra (Wheel of Perun-Parjanya-Indra-Taranis-IX, now known as Wheel of Mainz)[citation needed] was no more sanctioned by Germanic invaders. Nevertheless, until around 777 the remaining Veneti-Boii-Slavs of Boio-aria[citation needed] (Bavaria), now invaded and settled by Germans, were enslaved by Tassilo III.[22] Their ancient (Kopa/Hallstatt and La Tne) industries along their castles were acquired by Germanic invaders[citation needed]. The use of a triple Fleur-de-lis is basically a modified representation of the ancient Triskelion.\\r\\nSome details were described in the Chronicle of Fredegar, others may be found in the archives of the K?emenec (Kremsmnster) Abbey, near Salzburg. For German scholars studying those archives the connection between Slavs and Sens remains a mystery.[23]\\r\\nThe fleur de lis is widely thought to be a stylized version of the species Iris pseudacorus, or Iris florentina.[25][26] However, the lily (genus lilium, family Liliaceae) and the iris (family Iridaceae) are two different plants, phylogenetically and taxonomically unrelated. Lily (in Italian: giglio) is the name usually associated with the stylized flower in the Florentine heraldic devices. Decorative ornaments that resemble the fleur-de-lis have appeared in artwork from the earliest human civilizations.[peacock?term] According to Pierre-Augustin Boissier de Sauvages, an 18th-century French naturalist and lexicographer:[27]\\r\\nThe old fleurs-de-lis, especially the ones found in our first kings' sceptres, have a lot less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called flambas [in Occitan], or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, is the fact that the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Leie in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises as many plants grow for centuries in the same places: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of lis. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.\\r\\nThe heraldist Fran?ois Velde is of the same opinion.[28]\\r\\nHowever, a hypothesis ventured in the 17th c. sounds very plausible to me. One species of wild iris, the Iris pseudacorus, yellow flag in English, is yellow and grows in marshes (cf. the azure field, for water). Its name in German is Lieschblume (also gelbe Schwertlilie), but Liesch was also spelled Lies and Leys in the Middle Ages. It is easy to imagine that, in Northern France, the Lieschblume would have been called \\"fleur-de-lis.\\" This would explain the name and the formal origin of the design, as a stylized yellow flag. There is a fanciful legend about Clovis which links the yellow flag explicitly with the French coat of arms.\\r\\nSauvages' hypothesis seems to be supported by the archaic English spelling fleur-de-luce[29] and by the Luts's variant name Lits.\\r\\nIt has consistently been used as a royal emblem, though different cultures have interpreted its meaning in varying ways. Gaulish coins show the first Western designs which look similar to modern fleurs-de-lis.[30] In the East it was found on the gold helmet of a Scythian king uncovered at the Ak-Burun kurgan and conserved in Saint Petersburg's Hermitage Museum.[31]\\r\\nThere is also a statue of Kanishka the Great, the emperor of the Kushan dynasty in 127ÿ151 AD, in the Mathura Museum in India, with four modern Fleurs-de-lis symbols in a square emblem repeated twice on the bottom end of his smaller sword.\\r\\nAnother (debated) hypothesis is that the symbol derives from the Frankish Angon. The angon, or sting, was a typical Frankish throwing spear.\\r\\nA possibly derived symbol of Frankish royalty was the bee, of similar shape, as found in the burial of Childric I, whose royal see of power over the Salian Franks was based over the valley of the Lys.\\r\\nA more obscure origin from its common Germanic cultural background could tie it to the symbol of the Danish Royal House too, as suggested in many ancient legends or epic folk tradition as the Eddas or Beowulf, which refer to the arrival from sea of a child-king to inherit the realm, Scyld or Beow, with only a sheaf of corn as emblem ÿ as centuries later the Plantagenets would be represented -, all probably derived from ancestral fertility allegories and symbols of the arrival of corn (in the shape of a sheaf of wheat or rather, barley) in the human form of a child, (Beow as 'Boy' or baby-bubble 'grain to grow') to Germanic prehistoric people before agriculture bringing a new age of prosperity rebirth.\\r\\nA 9th-century mosaic, from San Giovanni church in Rome, shows St Peter handing the Oriflamme, the imperial banner, to Charlemagne. The finial of the oriflamme is clearly a spearhead and very like the earliest depictions of the fleur-de-lis, on the seals of Robert II (around 1000 AD) and Phillip II (around 1180 AD).\\r\\nAlso of note is that the red and green circles on the oriflamme are often said to depict flowers.[citation needed] A fleur de luce becomes flower of light, where light might allude to the golden flames that give the banner its name. A conflation, over time, of the lance, the flowers and the flames with the conserved spearhead used as a sceptre may be more probable than the French royal symbol being derived from a river in Frisia.[citation needed] The Roman Catholic Church has likewise credited Lily as the unique image of the Virgin Mary. It is additionally the image of Holy Trinity in view of its three petals. It is said that one can't accomplish the Trinity without Mary since she was the person who bore Jesus. The image speaks to valor, confidence and astuteness through its three petals.[32]\\r\\nThe graphic evolution of crita to fleur-de-lis was accompanied by textual allegory. By the late 13th century, an allegorical poem by Guillaume de Nangis (d. 1300), written at the abbey of Joyenval at Chambourcy, relates how the golden lilies on an azure ground were miraculously substituted for the crescents on Clovis' shield, a projection into the past of contemporary images of heraldry. Through this propagandist connection to Clovis, the fleur-de-lis has been taken in retrospect to symbolize all the Christian Frankish kings, most notably Charlemagne.\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis' symbolic origins with French monarchs may stem from the baptismal lily used in the crowning of King Clovis I. The French monarchy possibly adopted the Fleur-de-lis for its royal coat of arms as a symbol of purity to commemorate the conversion of Clovis I,[33] and a reminder of the Fleur-de-lis ampulla that held the oil used to anoint the king. So, the fleur-de-lis stood as a symbol of the king's divinely approved right to rule. The thus \\"anointed\\" Kings of France later maintained that their authority was directly from God. A legend enhances the mystique of royalty by informing us that a vial of oilthe Holy Ampulladescended from Heaven to anoint and sanctify Clovis as King,[34] descending directly on Clovis or perhaps brought by a dove to Saint Remigius. One version explains that an angel descended with the Fleur-de-lis ampulla to anoint the king.[35] Another story tells of Clovis putting a flower in his helmet just before his victory at the Battle of Vouill [36] Through this connection to Clovis, the fleur-de-lis has been taken to symbolize all the Christian Frankish kings, most famously Charlemagne.\\r\\nIn the 14th-century French writers asserted that the monarchy of France, which developed from the Kingdom of the West Franks, could trace its heritage back to the divine gift of royal arms received by Clovis. This story has remained popular, even though modern scholarship has established that the fleur-de-lis was a religious symbol before it was a true heraldic symbol.[37] Along with true lilies, it was associated with the Virgin Mary, and in the 12th century Louis VI and Louis VII started to use the emblem, on sceptres for example, so connecting their rulership with this symbol of saintliness and divine right. Louis VII ordered the use of fleur-de-lis clothing in his son Philip's coronation in 1179,[38] while the first visual evidence of clearly heraldic use dates from 1211: a seal showing the future Louis VIII and his shield strewn with the \\"flowers\\".[39] Until the late 14th century the French royal coat of arms was Azure sem-de-lis Or (a blue shield \\"sown\\" (sem) with a scattering of small golden fleurs-de-lis), but Charles V of France changed the design from an all-over scattering to a group of three in about 1376.[a][b] These two coats are known in heraldic terminology as France Ancient and France Modern respectively.\\r\\nIn the reign of King Louis IX (St. Louis) the three petals of the flower were said to represent faith, wisdom and chivalry, and to be a sign of divine favour bestowed on France.[40] During the next century, the 14th, the tradition of Trinity symbolism was established in France, and then spread elsewhere.\\r\\nIn 1328, King Edward III of England inherited a claim to the crown of France, and in about 1340 he quartered France Ancient with the arms of Plantagenet, as \\"arms of pretence\\". [c] After the kings of France adopted France Modern, the kings of England adopted the new design as quarterings from about 1411.[41] The monarchs of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to quarter the French arms until 1801, when George III abandoned his formal claim to the French throne.\\r\\nKing Charles VII ennobled Joan of Arc's family on 29 December 1429 with an inheritable symbolic denomination. The Chamber of Accounts in France registered the family's designation to nobility on 20 January 1430. The grant permitted the family to change their surname to du Lys.\\r\\nFrance Modern remained the French royal standard, and with a white background was the French national flag until the French Revolution, when it was replaced by the tricolor of modern-day France. The fleur-de-lis was restored to the French flag in 1814, but replaced once again after the revolution against Charles X of France in 1830.[d] In a very strange turn of events after the end of the Second French Empire, where a flag apparently influenced the course of history, Henri, comte de Chambord, was offered the throne as King of France, but he agreed only if France gave up the tricolor and brought back the white flag with fleurs-de-lis.[42] His condition was rejected and France became a republic.\\r\\nFleurs-de-lis feature prominently in the Crown Jewels of England and Scotland. In English heraldry, they are used in many different ways, and can be the cadency mark of the sixth son. Additionally, it features in a large amount of royal arms of the House of Plantagenet, from the 13th century onwards to the early Tudors (Elizabeth of York and the de la Pole family.)\\r\\nThe tressure floryÿcounterflory (flowered border) has been a prominent part of the design of the Scottish royal arms and Royal Standard since James I of Scotland.[e]\\r\\n??????????The treasured fleur-de-luce he claims\\r\\n??????????To wreathe his shield, since royal James\\r\\n???????????????Sir Walter Scott\\r\\n????????????????The Lay of the Last Minstrel[43]\\r\\nIn Italy, fleurs-de-lis have been used for some papal crowns[g] and coats of arms, the Farnese Dukes of Parma, and by some doges of Venice.\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis was also the symbol of the House of Kotromani?, a ruling house in medieval Bosnia allegedly in recognition of the Capetian House of Anjou, where the flower is thought of as a Lilium bosniacum.[h] Today, fleur-de-lis is a national symbol of Bosniaks.[i]\\r\\nOther countries using the emblem heraldically include Serbia and Spain in recognition of rulers from the House of Bourbon. Coins minted in 14th-century Romania, from the region that was the Principality of Moldova at the time, ruled by Petru I Mu?at, carry the fleur-de-lis symbol.[44]\\r\\nAs a dynastic emblem it has also been very widely used: not only by noble families but also, for example, by the Fuggers, a medieval banking family.\\r\\nThree fleurs-de-lis appeared in the personal coat of arms of Grandmaster Alof de Wignacourt who ruled the Malta between 1601 and 1622. His nephew Adrien de Wignacourt, who was Grandmaster himself from 1690 to 1697, also had a similar coat of arms with three fleurs-de-lis.\\r\\nFleurs-de-lis crossed the Atlantic along with Europeans going to the New World, especially with French settlers. Their presence on North American flags and coats of arms usually recalls the involvement of French settlers in the history of the town or region concerned, and in some cases the persisting presence there of a population descended from such settlers.\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis appears on the Canadian coat of arms, the flag of Quebec,[j] known as the Fleurdelis, and also those of Montreal, Sherbrooke and Trois-Rivires. It is also featured on the personal flag used in Canada by the Queen of the Commonwealth.[45] There are many French-speaking people in other Canadian provinces for whom the fleur-de-lis remains a symbol of their cultural identity. Franco-Ontarians, for example, feature the fleur-de-lis prominently on their flag.\\r\\nIn the US, the fleur-de-lis symbols tend to be along or near the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. These are areas of strong French colonial empire settlement. Some of the places that have it in their flag or seal are the cities of St. Louis,[m] Louisville, Detroit, Mobile, New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Lafayette. On 9 July 2008, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal signed a bill into law making the fleur-de-lis an official symbol of the state.[46] Following Hurricane Katrina, the fleur-de-lis has been widely used in New Orleans and throughout Louisiana, as a symbol of grassroots support for New Orleans' recovery.[47] It has also become the symbol for the identity of the Cajuns and Louisiana Creole people, and their French heritage.\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis appears on the coat of Guadeloupe, an overseas dpartement of France in the Caribbean, Saint Barthlemy, an overseas collectivity of France, and French Guiana. The overseas department of Runion in the Indian Ocean uses the same feature. It appears on the coat of Port Louis, the capital of Mauritius which was named in honour of King Louis XV. On the coat of arms of Saint Lucia it represents the French heritage of the country.\\r\\nIn Saskatchewan the Western Red Lily appears on the provincial flag and is sometimes used as a symbol of the province. Some representations resemble a fleur de lis but the traditional version itself is rarely used.\\r\\nIn the Middle Ages, the symbols of lily and fleur-de-lis overlapped considerably in Christian religious art. Michel Pastoureau, a historian, says that until about 1300 they were found in depictions of Jesus, but gradually they took on Marian symbolism and were associated with the Song of Solomon's \\"lily among thorns\\" (lilium inter spinas), understood as a reference to Mary. Other scripture and religious literature in which the lily symbolizes purity and chastity also helped establish the flower as an iconographic attribute of the Virgin. It was also believed that the fleur-de-lis represented the Holy Trinity.[49][50]\\r\\nIn medieval England, from the mid-12th century, a noblewoman's seal often showed the lady with a fleur-de-lis, drawing on the Marian connotations of \\"female virtue and spirituality\\".[51] Images of Mary holding the flower first appeared in the 11th century on coins issued by cathedrals dedicated to her, and next on the seals of cathedral chapters, starting with Notre Dame de Paris in 1146. A standard portrayal was of Mary carrying the flower in her right hand, just as she is shown in that church's Virgin of Paris statue (with lily), and in the centre of the stained glass rose window (with fleur-de-lis sceptre) above its main entrance. The flowers may be \\"simple fleurons, sometimes garden lilies, sometimes genuine heraldic fleurs-de-lis\\".[39] As attributes of the Madonna, they are often seen in pictures of the Annunciation, notably in those of Sandro Botticelli and Filippo Lippi. Lippi also uses both flowers in other related contexts: for instance, in his Madonna in the Forest.\\r\\nThe three petals of the heraldic design reflect a widespread association with the Holy Trinity, with the band on the bottom symbolizing Mary. The tradition says that without Mary you can not understand the Trinity since it was she who bore the Son.[52] A tradition going back to 14th century France[30] added onto the earlier belief that they also represented faith, wisdom and chivalry. Alternatively, the cord can be seen as representing the one Divine Substance (godhood) of the three Persons, which binds Them together.\\r\\n\\"Flower of light\\" symbolism has sometimes been understood from the archaic variant fleur-de-luce (see Latin lux, luc- = \\"light\\"), but the Oxford English Dictionary suggests this arose from the spelling, not from the etymology.[53]\\r\\nIn building and architecture, the fleur-de-lis is often placed on top of iron fence posts, as a pointed defence against intruders. It may ornament any tip, point or post with a decorative flourish, for instance, on finials, the arms of a cross, or the point of a gable. The fleur-de-lis can be incorporated in friezes or cornices, although the distinctions between fleur-de-lis, fleuron, and other stylized flowers are not always clear,[24][54] or can be used as a motif in an all-over tiled pattern, perhaps on a floor. It may appear in a building for heraldic reasons, as in some English churches where the design paid a compliment to a local lord who used the flower on his coat of arms. Elsewhere the effect seems purely visual, like the crenellations on the 14th-century Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan. It can also be seen on the doors of 16th-century Padmanabhaswamy Temple.\\r\\nSome modern usage of the fleur-de-lis reflects \\"the continuing presence of heraldry in everyday life\\", often intentionally, but also when users are not aware that they are \\"prolonging the life of centuries-old insignia and emblems\\".[55]\\r\\nFleurs-de-lis are featured on military badges like those of the United States Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment, Israeli Intelligence Corps, the First World War Canadian Expeditionary Force, the 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team and the Corps of Cadets at Louisiana State University. In the British Army, the fleur-de-lis was the cap badge of the Manchester Regiment from 1922 until 1958, and also its successor, the King's Regiment up to its amalgamation in 2006. It commemorates the capture of French regimental colours by their predecessors, the 63rd Regiment of Foot, during the Invasion of Martinique in 1759.[56] It is also the formation sign of the 2nd (Independent) Armored Brigade of the Indian Army which was known as 7th Indian Cavalry Brigade in First World War, received the emblem for its actions in France.[57]\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis is used by a number of sports teams, especially when it echoes a local flag. This is true with the former Quebec Nordiques National Hockey League team and the former Montreal Expos Major League Baseball team, the Serie A team Fiorentina, the Bundesliga side SV Darmstadt 98 (also known as Die Lilien ÿ The Lilies), the Major League Soccer team the Montreal Impact, the sports teams of New Orleans, Louisiana in the NFL, NBA and the Pacific Coast League, the Rugby League team Wakefield Trinity Wildcats and the NPSL team Detroit City FC. Marc-Andr Fleury, a Canadian ice hockey goaltender, has a fleur-de-lis logo on his mask. The UFC Welterweight Champion from 2006 to 2013, Georges St-Pierre, has a tattoo of the fleur-de-lis on his right calf. The IT University of Copenhagen's soccer team ITU F.C. has it in their logo.[58] France used the symbol in the official emblem on the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup [59]\\r\\nThe emblem appears in coats of arms and logos for universities (like the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and Saint Louis University and Washington University in Missouri) and schools such as in Hilton College (South Africa), St. Peter, Minnesota and St. Pauls University in the Philippines. The Lady Knights of the University of Arkansas at Monticello have also adopted the fleur de lis as one of the symbols associated with their coat of arms. The flag of Lincolnshire, adopted in 2005, has a fleur-de-lis for the city of Lincoln. It is one of the symbols of the American sororities Kappa Kappa Gamma and Theta Phi Alpha, the American fraternities Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Alpha Mu, as well as the international co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega. It is also used by the high school and college fraternity Scouts Royale Brotherhood of the Philippines.\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis is the main element in the logo of most Scouting organizations. The symbol was first used by Sir Robert Baden-Powell as an arm-badge for soldiers who qualified as scouts (reconnaissance specialists) in the 5th Dragoon Guards, which he commanded at the end of the 19th century; it was later used in cavalry regiments throughout the British Army until 1921. In 1907, Baden-Powell made brass fleur-de-lis badges for the boys attending his first experimental \\"Boy Scout\\" camp at Brownsea Island.[60] In his seminal book Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell referred to the motif as \\"the arrowhead which shows the North on a map or a compass\\" and continued; \\"It is the Badge of the Scout because it points in the right direction and upward... The three points remind you of the three points of the Scout Promise\\",[61] being duty to God and country, helping others and keeping the Scout Law. The World Scout Emblem of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, has elements which are used by most national Scout organizations. The stars stand for truth and knowledge, the encircling rope for unity, and its reef knot or square knot, service.[62]\\r\\nThe symbol may be used in less traditional ways. After Hurricane Katrina many New Orleanians of varying ages and backgrounds were tattooed with \\"one of its cultural emblems\\" as a \\"memorial\\" of the storm, according to a researcher at Tulane University.[63] The US Navy Blue Angels have named a looping flight demonstration manoeuvre after the flower as well, and there are even two surgical procedures called \\"after the fleur.\\"\\r\\nAmerican automobile manufacturer Chevrolet takes its name from the racing driver Louis Chevrolet, who was born in Switzerland. But, because the Chevrolet name is French, the manufacturer has used the fleur-de-lis emblems on their cars, most notably the Corvette, but also as a small detail in the badges and emblems on the front of a variety of full-size Chevys from the 1950s, and 1960s. The fleur-de-lis has also been featured more prominently in the emblems of the Caprice sedan.\\r\\nA fleur-de-lis also appears in some of the logos of local Louisiana media. Such as in the logo of WGNO-TV, the local ABC-affiliated television station in New Orleans, and WVUE-TV, the local Fox-affiliated television station in New Orleans.\\r\\nA red fleur-de-lis is the emblem of the British-Bermudan insurance company Hiscox.\\r\\nThe fleur-de-lis is one of the objects to drop during the New Year's Eve celebrations in New Orleans.\\r\\nThe symbol has featured in modern fiction on historical and mystical themes, as in the bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code and other books discussing the Priory of Sion. It recurs in French literature, where examples well known in English translation include Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier, a character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame by Victor Hugo, and the mention in Dumas's The Three Musketeers of the old custom of branding a criminal with the sign (fleurdeliser). During the reign of Elizabeth I of England, known as the Elizabethan era, it was a standard name for an iris, a usage which lasted for centuries,[64] but occasionally refers to lilies or other flowers. It also appeared in the novel A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole on a sign composed by the main character.\\r\\nExplanatory notes\\r\\nCitations","input":"What is the new orleans saints symbol called?"},{"output":"observation and telecommunications","context":"The Sky Tower is an observation and telecommunications tower located at the corner of Victoria and Federal Streets in the Auckland CBD, Auckland, New Zealand. It is 328 metres (1,076?ft) tall, as measured from ground level to the top of the mast,[4] making it the tallest freestanding structure in the Southern Hemisphere[5] and the 23rd tallest tower in the world. It has become an iconic landmark in Auckland's skyline due to its height and unique design.\\r\\nThe tower is part of the SkyCity Auckland casino complex, originally built in 1994ÿ1997 for Harrah's Entertainment.[3] Several upper levels are accessible to the public, attracting an average of 1,150 visitors per day (over 415,000 per year).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sky Tower has several upper levels that are accessible to the public:\\r\\nThe upper portion of the tower contains two restaurants and a cafeincluding New Zealand's only revolving restaurant, located 190?m (620?ft) from the ground, which turns 360 degrees every hour.[7] There is also a brasserie-style buffet located one floor above the main observatory level. It has three observation decks at different heights, each providing 360-degree views of the city. The main observation level at 186?m (610?ft) has 38?mm (1.5?in) thick glass sections of flooring giving a view straight to the ground.[8] The top observation deck labeled \\"Skydeck\\" sits just below the main antenna at 220?m (720?ft) and gives views of up to 82?km (51?mi) in the distance.[9]\\r\\nThe tower also features the \\"SkyJump\\", a 192-metre (630?ft)[10] jump from the observation deck, during which a jumper can reach up to 85?km/h (53?mph). The jump is guide-cable-controlled to prevent jumpers from colliding with the tower in case of wind gusts.[11] Climbs into the antenna mast portion (300?m or 980?ft heights) are also possible for tour groups,[10] as is a walk around the exterior.[12]\\r\\nThe tower is also used for telecommunications and broadcasting with the Auckland Peering Exchange (APE) being located on Level 48.[13] The aerial at the top of the tower hosts the largest FM combiner in the world[8] which combines with 58 wireless microwave links located above the top restaurant to provide a number of services. These include television, wireless internet, RT, and weather measurement services.[8]\\r\\nThe tower is Auckland's primary FM radio transmitter, and is one of four infill terrestrial television transmitters in Auckland, serving areas not covered by the main transmitter at Waiatarua in the Waitakere Ranges. A total of twenty-three FM radio stations and six digital terrestrial television multiplexes broadcast from the tower.[14][15] Two VHF analogue television channels broadcasting from the tower were switched off in the early hours of Sunday 1 December 2013 as part of New Zealand's digital television transition.[16]\\r\\nThe following table contains television and radio frequencies currently operating from the Sky Tower:\\r\\nFletcher Construction was the contracted builder for the project while engineering firm Beca Group provided the design management and coordination, structural, geotechnical, civil, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, lighting and fire engineering services. Harrison Grierson[17] provided surveying services. It was designed by Gordon Moller of Craig Craig Moller architects[2] and has received a New Zealand Institute of Architects National Award as well as regional awards.[18][19][20] The Project Architect was Les Dykstra.[21]\\r\\nTaking two years and nine months to construct,[22] the tower was opened on 3 August 1997.[23]\\r\\nThe tower is constructed of high-performance reinforced concrete. Its 12-metre (39?ft) diameter shaft (containing three lifts and an emergency stairwell) is supported on eight \\"legs\\" based on 16 foundation piles drilled over 12?m (39?ft) deep into the local sandstone.[19][20] The main shaft was built using climbing formwork.[20]\\r\\nThe upper levels were constructed from composite materials, structural steel, precast concrete and reinforced concrete,[20] and the observation decks clad in aluminium with blue/green reflective glass. A structural steel framework supports the upper mast structure. During construction 15,000 cubic metres (20,000?cu?yd) of concrete, 2,000 tonnes (2,200 short tons) of reinforcing steel, and 660 tonnes (730 short tons) of structural steel were used. The mast weighs over 170 tonnes (190 short tons).[20][24] It had to be lifted into place using a crane attached to the structure, as it would have been too heavy for a helicopter to lift. To then remove the crane, another crane had to be constructed attached to the upper part of the Sky Tower structure, which dismantled the big crane, and was in turn dismantled into pieces small enough to fit into the elevator.[20]\\r\\nThe tower is designed to withstand wind in excess of 200?km/h (120?mph) and designed to sway up to 1 metre (39?in) in excessively high winds. As a safety precaution the Sky Towers lifts have special technology installed to detect movement (such as swaying due to high wind) and will automatically slow down. If the building sway exceeds predetermined safety levels the lifts will return to the ground floor and remain there until the high winds and building sway have abated.[25]\\r\\nThe Sky Tower is built to withstand an 8.0 magnitude earthquake located within a 20-kilometre (12?mi) radius.[26] There are three fireproof rooms on levels 44, 45, and 46 to provide refuge in the event of an emergency, while the central service lift shaft and stairwells are also fire-safety rated.\\r\\nSkyCity Auckland lights the Sky Tower to show support for a range of organisations and charities. Common lighting events include:\\r\\nThe top half of the Sky Tower is lit by energy efficient LED lighting which replaced the original metal halide floodlights in May 2009. The LEDs can produce millions of different colour combinations controlled by a computer system. The original lights used 66 per cent more energy than the current LED system. The bottom half is lit by halogen lamps.\\r\\nDuring the winter months, electricity consumption in New Zealand increases dramatically. As much of the power reserve in the country depends on the water level of the hydro-lakes, various power-saving schemes are introduced to prevent blackouts.[citation needed] In an effort to promote power saving, SkyCity turned off the tower lighting in Winter 2008, retaining only the flashing red aviation lights. SkyCity is also minimising fa?ade flood lighting across its complex. Simon Jamieson, General Manager SKYCITY Auckland Hotels Group, said: \\"Like every New Zealander, we are concerned about the country's electricity supply, and we believe it is our responsibility to make this move to assist with the power saving request.\\"[27] The tower was reilluminated on 4 August in support of New Zealand athletes competing at the Beijing Olympics.[28]\\r\\nThe SkyTower also use wall lights for different events, for example, they had a LED Santa on the 2007 Christmas.\\r\\nThe Sky Tower is used in support of special charity events. The Leukemia and Blood Foundation of New Zealand organises annual fundraising stair climb challenges, notably the \\"Firefighters Sky Tower Stair Challenge\\" which sees firefighters from around New Zealand race up 1,108 steps (out of 1,267 total steps),[29] Climbing the Sky Tower stairs has been described as a \\"vertical marathon\\".\\r\\nFor celebrations like New Year's Eve and Chinese New Year SkyCity Auckland projects an impressive fireworks display from the Sky Tower which can be seen across Auckland.","input":"What is the purpose of the sky tower?"},{"output":"the development of space travel techniques to support the Apollo mission to land astronauts on the Moon","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n2:\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gemini was NASA's second human spaceflight program. Conducted between projects Mercury and Apollo, Gemini started in 1961 and concluded in 1966. The Gemini spacecraft carried a two-astronaut crew. Ten Gemini crews flew low Earth orbit (LEO) missions during 1965 and 1966, putting the United States in the lead during the Cold War Space Race against the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini's objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the Apollo mission to land astronauts on the Moon. It performed missions long enough for a trip to the Moon and back, perfected working outside the spacecraft with extra-vehicular activity (EVA), and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking. With these new techniques proven by Gemini, Apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Gemini flights were launched from Launch Complex 19 (LC-19) at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station in Florida. Their launch vehicle was the GeminiÿTitan II, a modified Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM).[Note 1] Gemini was the first program to use the newly built Mission Control Center at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center for flight control.[Note 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe astronaut corps that supported Project Gemini included the \\"Mercury Seven\\", \\"The New Nine\\", and the 1963 astronaut class. During the program, three astronauts died in air crashes during training, including the prime crew for Gemini 9. This mission was flown by the backup crew, the only time that has happened in NASA's history to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini was robust enough that the United States Air Force planned to use it for the Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL) program, which was later canceled. Gemini's chief designer, Jim Chamberlin, also made detailed plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late 1961. He believed that Gemini spacecraft could fly in lunar operations before Project Apollo, and cost less. NASA's administration did not approve those plans. In 1969, McDonnell-Douglas proposed a \\"Big Gemini\\" that could have been used to shuttle up to 12 astronauts to the planned space stations in the Apollo Applications Project (AAP). The only AAP project funded was Skylab ÿ which used existing spacecraft and hardware ÿ thereby eliminating the need for Big Gemini.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the existing Apollo program was chartered by President John F. Kennedy on May 25, 1961, to land men on the Moon, it became evident to NASA officials that a follow-on to the Mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of Apollo.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifically, Jim Chamberlin, the head of engineering at the Space Task Group (STG), was already assigned to start working on a bridge program between Mercury and Apollo in February 1961.[2] He presented two initial versions of Gemini at a NASA retreat at Wallops Island in March 1961.[2] Scale models of Mercury Mark II were shown in July 1961 at McDonnell Aircraft Corporation's offices in St. Louis.[2]  NASA approved Project Gemini on December 7, 1961.[2] The McDonnell Aircraft Corporation was contracted to build it on December 22, 1961.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was publicly announced on January 3, 1962, it was formally re-christened Project Gemini. Gemini in Latin means \\"twins\\" or \\"double\\", which reflected that the spacecraft would hold two astronauts. Gemini is also the name of the third constellation of the Zodiac and its twin stars, Castor and Pollux.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major objectives were:[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian Jim Chamberlin designed the Gemini capsule, which carried a crew of two. He was previously the chief aerodynamicist on Avro Canada's Avro Arrow fighter interceptor program.[5] Chamberlin joined NASA along with 25 senior Avro engineers after cancellation of the Arrow program, and became head of the U.S. Space Task Group's engineering division in charge of Gemini.[5][6] The prime contractor was McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, which was also the prime contractor for the Project Mercury capsule.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAstronaut Gus Grissom was heavily involved in the development and design of the Gemini spacecraft (the other Mercury astronauts dubbed the Gemini spacecraft the \\"Gusmobile\\").[8] Grissom wrote in his posthumous 1968 book Gemini! that the realization of Project Mercury's end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all of his efforts on the upcoming Gemini program.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gemini program was managed by the Manned Spacecraft Center, located in Houston, Texas, under direction of the Office of Manned Space Flight, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. Dr. George E. Mueller, Associate Administrator of NASA for Manned Space Flight, served as acting director of the Gemini program. William C. Schneider, Deputy Director of Manned Space Flight for Mission Operations, served as mission director on all Gemini flights beginning with Gemini 6A.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuenter Wendt was a McDonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the Mercury and Gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the Apollo program launched crews. His team was responsible for completion of the complex pad close-out procedures just prior to spacecraft launch, and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch. The astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over, and responsibility for, the condition of the spacecraft and developed a good-humored rapport with him.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA selected McDonnell Aircraft, which had been the prime contractor for the Project Mercury capsule, in 1961 to build the Gemini capsule, the first of which was delivered in 1963. The spacecraft was 18?feet 5?inches (5.61?m) long and 10 feet (3.0?m) wide, with a launch weight varying from 7,100 to 8,350 pounds (3,220 to 3,790?kg).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gemini crew capsule (referred to as the Reentry Module) was essentially an enlarged version of the Mercury capsule. Unlike Mercury, the retrorockets, electrical power, propulsion systems, oxygen, and water were located in a detachable Adapter Module behind the Reentry Module. A major design improvement in Gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components, which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary, without removing or disturbing other already tested components.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors. Unlike Mercury, Gemini used completely solid-state electronics, and its modular design made it easy to repair.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini's emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solid-fuel rocket, but instead used aircraft-style ejection seats. The tower was heavy and complicated, and NASA engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the Titan II's hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact. A Titan II booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled Atlas and Saturn. Ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle. At higher altitudes, where the ejection seats could not be used, the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft, which would separate from the launch vehicle.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main proponent of using ejection seats was James Chamberlin, head of the engineering division of NASA's Space Force Task Group. Chamberlin had never liked the Mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight. He reviewed several films of Atlas and Titan II ICBM failures, which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the Titan II would produce a much smaller explosion, thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaxime Faget, the designer of the Mercury LES, was on the other hand less-than-enthusiastic about this setup. Aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts, they would also only be usable for about 40 seconds after liftoff, by which point the booster would be attaining Mach 1 speed and ejection would no longer be possible. He was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the Titan's exhaust plume if they ejected in-flight and later added that \\"The best thing about Gemini was that they never had to make an escape.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini was the first astronaut-carrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer, the Gemini Guidance Computer, to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers. This computer, sometimes called the Gemini Spacecraft On-Board Computer (OBC), was very similar to the Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer. The Gemini Guidance Computer weighed 58.98 pounds (26.75?kg). Its core memory had 4096 addresses, each containing a 39-bit word composed of three 13-bit \\"syllables\\". All numeric data was 26-bit two's-complement integers (sometimes used as fixed-point numbers), either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator. Instructions (always with a 4-bit opcode and 9 bits of operand) could go in any syllable.[14][15][16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike Mercury, the Gemini used in-flight radar and an artificial horizondevices similar to those used in the aviation industry.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original intention for Gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea, using a Rogallo wing rather than a parachute, with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft. To facilitate this, the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft, but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield. This cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches.[18] This design was ultimately dropped, and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in Mercury. The capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal, so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first. This eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the Mercury capsule.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adapter module in turn was separated into a Retro module and an Equipment module.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retro module contained four solid-fuel TE-M-385 Star-13E retrorockets, each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle, which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module, crossing at right angles in the center.[19] Re-entry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time. Abort procedures at certain periods during lift-off would cause them to fire at the same time, thrusting the Descent module away from the Titan rocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini was equipped with an Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS), containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes (forward/backward, left/right, up/down), in addition to attitude control (pitch, yaw, and roll angle orientation) as in Mercury. Translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude, necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft, and docking with the Agena Target Vehicle (ATV), with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly short-duration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries; later endurance missions used the first fuel cells in manned spacecraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini was in some regards more advanced than Apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier. It became known as a \\"pilot's spacecraft\\" due to its assortment of jet fighter-like features, in no small part due to Gus Grissom's influence over the design, and it was at this point where the American manned space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the Soviet Union with long duration flight, rendezvous, and extravehicular capability.[Note 4] The Soviet Union during this period was developing the Soyuz spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the Moon, but political and technical problems began to get in the way, leading to the ultimate end of their manned lunar program.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Titan II had debuted in 1962 as the Air Force's second-generation ICBM to replace the Atlas. By using hypergolic fuels, it could be stored for long periods of time and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components, the only caveat being that the propellant mix (nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine) was extremely toxic compared to the Atlas's liquid oxygen/RP-1. However, the Titan had considerable difficulty being man-rated due to early problems with pogo oscillation. The launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from Cape Kennedy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeke Slayton, as director of flight crew operations, had primary responsibility for assigning crews for the Gemini program. Each flight had a primary crew and backup crew, and the backup crew would rotate to primary crew status three flights later. Slayton intended for first choice of mission commands to be given to the four remaining active astronauts of the Mercury Seven: Alan Shepard, Grissom, Cooper, and Schirra. (John Glenn had retired from NASA in January 1964 and Scott Carpenter, who was blamed by some in NASA management for the problematic reentry of Aurora 7, was on leave to participate in the Navy's SEALAB project and was grounded from flight in July 1964 due to an arm injury sustained in a motorbike accident. Slayton himself continued to be grounded due to a heart problem.)\\r\\n\\r\\nTitles used for the left-hand (command) and right-hand seat crew positions were taken from the U.S. Air Force pilot ratings, Command Pilot and Pilot. Sixteen astronauts flew on 10 manned Gemini missions:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1963, Slayton selected Shepard and Stafford for Gemini 3, McDivitt and White for Gemini 4, and Schirra and Young for Gemini 5 (which was to be the first Agena rendezvous mission). The backup crew for Gemini 3 was Grissom and Borman, who were also slated for Gemini 6, to be the first long-duration mission. Finally Conrad and Lovell were assigned as the backup crew for Gemini 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nDelays in the production of the Agena Target Vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation. The Schirra and Young mission was bumped to Gemini 6 and they became the backup crew for Shepard and Stafford. Grissom and Borman then had their long-duration mission assigned to Gemini 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second rearrangement occurred when Shepard developed Mnire's disease, an inner ear problem. Grissom was then moved to command Gemini 3. Slayton felt that Young was a better personality match with Grissom and switched Stafford and Young. Finally, Slayton tapped Cooper to command the long-duration Gemini 5. Again for reasons of compatibility, he moved Conrad from backup commander of Gemini 4 to pilot of Gemini 5, and Borman to backup command of Gemini 4. Finally he assigned Armstrong and Elliot See to be the backup crew for Gemini 5.\\r\\nThe third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when Slayton felt that See wasn't up to the physical demands of EVA on Gemini 8. He reassigned See to be the prime commander of Gemini 9 and put Scott as pilot of Gemini 8 and Charles Bassett as the pilot of Gemini 9.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth and final rearrangement of the Gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of See and Bassett when their trainer jet crashed, coincidentally into a McDonnell building which held their Gemini 9 capsule in St. Louis. The backup crew of Stafford and Cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of the re-designated Gemini 9A. Lovell and Aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of Gemini 10 to be the backup crew of Gemini 9. This cleared the way through the crew rotation for Lovell and Aldrin to become the prime crew of Gemini 12.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the deaths of Grissom, White, and Roger Chaffee in the fire of Apollo 1, this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven Apollo crews, and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1964 and 1965 two Gemini missions were flown without crews to test out systems and the heat shield. These were followed by ten flights with crews in 1965 and 1966. All were launched by Titan II launch vehicles. Some highlights from the Gemini program:\\r\\n\\r\\nRendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver. Should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another, the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases. The right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first, and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other.[21] To practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward White during spacewalk, Gemini 4, June 1965\\r\\n\\r\\nRendezvous of Gemini 6 and 7, December 1965\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst docking; Agena target is seen from Gemini 8, March 1966\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gemini-Titan II launch vehicle was adapted by NASA from the U.S. Air Force Titan II ICBM. (Similarly, the Mercury-Atlas launch vehicle had been adapted from the USAF Atlas missile.) The Gemini-Titan II rockets were assigned Air Force serial numbers, which were painted in four places on each Titan II (on opposite sides on each of the first and second stages). USAF crews maintained Launch Complex 19 and prepared and launched all of the Gemini-Titan II launch vehicles. Data and experience operating the Titans was of value to both the U.S. Air Force and NASA.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe USAF serial numbers assigned to the Gemini-Titan launch vehicles are given in the tables above. Fifteen Titan IIs were ordered in 1962 so the serial is \\"62-12XXX\\", but only \\"12XXX\\" is painted on the Titan II. The order for the last three of the 15 launch vehicles was canceled on July 30, 1964, and they were never built. Serial numbers were, however, assigned to them prospectively: 12568 - GLV-13; 12569 - GLV-14; and 12570 - GLV-15.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1962 to 1967, Gemini cost $1.3 billion in 1967 dollars ($7.32?billion in 2016[23]).[1] In January 1969, a NASA report to the US Congress estimating the costs for Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo (through the first manned Moon landing) included $1.2834 billion for Gemini: $797.4 million for spacecraft, $409.8 million for launch vehicles, and $76.2 million for support.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonnell Aircraft, the main contractor for Mercury and Gemini, was also one of the original bidders on the prime contract for Apollo, but lost out to North American Aviation. McDonnell later sought to extend the Gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a cislunar mission and even achieve a manned lunar landing earlier and at less cost than Apollo, but these proposals were rejected by NASA.\\r\\n\\r\\nA range of applications were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, space station crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights. The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the Agena Target Vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the Centaur, which could propel the spacecraft to the Moon, to complete modifications of the Gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface. Its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before Apollo was ready, to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews, or even replacing the Apollo program.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the Advanced Gemini proposals used \\"off-the-shelf\\" Gemini spacecraft, unmodified from the original program, while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew, dock with space stations, visit the Moon, and perform other mission objectives. Other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft, in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBig Gemini (or \\"Big G\\") was another proposal by McDonnell Douglas made in August 1969. It was intended to provide large-capacity, all-purpose access to space, including missions that ultimately used Apollo or the Space Shuttle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from Gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station. Land-landing at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements. Two baseline spacecraft were defined: a nine-man minimum modification version of the Gemini B called Min-Mod Big G and a 12-man advanced concept, having the same exterior geometry but with new, state-of-the-art subsystems, called Advanced Big G.[citation needed] Three launch vehicles-Saturn IB, Titan IIIM, and Saturn INT-20 (S-IC/S-IVB) were investigated for use with the spacecraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Air Force had an interest in the Gemini system, and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the Manned Orbital Laboratory. To this end, the Gemini 2 spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the MOL, sent into space by a Titan IIIC. This was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe USAF also had the notion of adapting the Gemini spacecraft for military applications, such as crude observation of the ground (no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried) and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites. This project was called Blue Gemini. The USAF did not like the fact that Gemini would have to be recovered by the US Navy, so they intended for Blue Gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids, carried over from the original design of Gemini.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first some within NASA welcomed sharing of the cost with the USAF, but it was later agreed that NASA was better off operating Gemini by itself. Blue Gemini was canceled in 1963 by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who decided that the NASA Gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments. MOL was canceled by Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird in 1969, when it was determined that unmanned spy satellites could perform the same functions much more cost-effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.","input":"What was the main goal of the gemini program?"},{"output":"June 25ÿ26, 1876","context":"","input":"When was the battle of little bighorn fought?"},{"output":"Greater Chennai Corporation","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chennai Municipal Corporation (officially the Greater Chennai Corporation[1]), formerly known as the Corporation of Madras, is the civic body that governs the city of Chennai (formerly Madras), India. Inaugurated on 29 September 1688, under a Royal Charter issued by King James II on 30 December 1687 as the Corporation of Madras, it is the oldest municipal body of the Commonwealth of Nations outside Great Britain.[2] It is headed by a mayor, who presides over 200 councillors each of whom represents one of the 200 wards of the city.[3] It is also the second oldest city civic body in the world after London.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Madras Corporation is the oldest municipal body of the Commonwealth of Nations outside the United Kingdom. It was formed in 1688 to control the powers of the Governor of Madras, Elihu Yale.[5] The Corporation was created by a Royal Charter issued on 30 December 1687 by King James II on the advice of the chairman of the East India Company, Josiah Child, on the model of Dutch Government in the East Indies.[6] The charter constituted the existing town of Fort St. George and all the territories belonging to the town, not exceeding a distance of ten miles from the Fort, into a Corporation. The Parliamentary Act of 1792 conferred the new Corporation power to levy municipal taxes in the city. The municipal administration also commenced from this act, making provision for the administration of the city. The Municipal Act continued to be amended, constantly introducing major changes in the constitution and powers of the Corporation from time to time.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the establishments of the corporation, the Governor of Madras or the Company's agent managed the affairs of the Fort St George and its residents with the assistance of a headman, an accountant, and the head of watch and ward. The Governor sat as Madras's Justice of the Peace. Taxes were introduced by Governor Streynsham Master (1678ÿ1681). Complications arising out of these impositions and the growing expenses of an expanding town led to Sir Josiah drawing up plans for a more formal body of civic administration. The Corporation was inaugurated on 29 September 1688 with power to decide on petty cases, levy rates upon the inhabitants for building of schools, a town hall and a jail, when the new Mayor, 12 Aldermen and 60 Burgesses took their oaths.[6] The first members of the Corporation were representatives from diverse ethnicities. Nathaniel Higginson was the first Mayor, and he appointed representatives from the English, Scottish, French, Portuguese, and Indian mercantile communities as Aldermen. The post of the Mayor was held for one year at a time, the Mayor being elected by the Aldermen, whose term of office was for life.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1856, the duties of the Corporation became more clearly defined. In 1919, the Aldermen were re-styled as 'Councillors'. The title of 'Mayor' had been replaced by 'President', and P. Theagaraya Chetty was nominated as President, the first Indian to be so chosen. However, the office of Mayor was re-created in 1933, when Kumararajah M. A. Muthiah Chettiar made the transition from last President to first new Mayor. The mayoralty has remained thereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1901, the Corporation had grown to encompass an area of 68?sq?km comprising 30 territorial divisions with a population of 540,000.[7] In 1913, the Corporation moved to the newly constructed Ripon Building, which was built on parts of the People's Park. The building was named after Lord Ripon who, as Viceroy of India from 1880 to 1884, had introduced local government reforms. He is remembered in a statue in the Corporation precincts. The first native Indian to both govern the Madras Presidency and later serve as Mayor of erstwhile Madras was the Honourable K. Sriramulu Naidu, who served during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1978, the boundaries of the area administrated by the Corporation was increased to 174?sq?km.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Madras Municipal Corporation Act, 1919 (as amended) provides the basic statutory authority for the administration now.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreater Chennai Corporation Soon will have Different Zone Corporation Based at Tambaram, Pallavaram, Avadi as\\r\\nChennai Tambaram Corporation\\r\\nChennai Pallavaram Corporation and\\r\\nChennai Avadi Corporation\\r\\nThese satellite Corporation will Work Under Greater Chennai Corporation  to make Chennai as the Best Smart City.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2011, the expansion process was initiated before the elections to the corporation council in October. In this move, 42 small local bodies, including 9 municipalities, 8 town panchayats and 25 village panchayats, were merged with Chennai Corporation, taking the area up by 140% to 426?km2?from the earlier 176?km2.[7][8] Some areas have been arbitrarily left out, to the discontent of the residents of those areas.[9] The new expanded Corporation of Chennai has 200 wards, an increase of 45 wards.[10] Elections were held for the expanded corporation in October 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe erstwhile municipalities that became a part of expanded Chennai Corporation are Kathivakkam, Tiruvottiyur, Manali, Madhavaram, Ambattur, Maduravoyal, Valasaravakkam, Alandur and Ullagaram- Puzhudhivakkam.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe erstwhile town panchayats that became a part of expanded Chennai Corporation are Chinna Sekkadu, Puzhal, Porur, Nandambakkam, Meenambakkam, Perungudi, Pallikaranai and Sholinganallur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe erstwhile panchayat unions that became a part of expanded Chennai Corporation are Edayanchavady, Sadayankuppam, Kattapakkam, Theeyampakkam, Mathur, Vada Perumbakkam, Surapet, Kathirvedu, Puthagaram, Nolambur, Karambakkam, Nerkundram, Ramapuram, Mugaliwakkam, Manapakkam, Kottivakkam, Palavakkam, Neelankarai, Injambakkam, Karapakkam, Okkiam Thoraipakkam, Madipakkam, Jaladampet, Semmanchery and Uthandi.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016 January chief minister inaugurated greater Chennai corporation limit will extend up to \\r\\nmunicipalities like Tambaram and Tambaram Taulk region follows, Town panchayat like chitlapakkam,sembakkam, madambakkam, perungalathur, peerkankaranai and Census Town like Mudichur\\r\\nOther sripembudur and Chengalpattu taulk Panchayat villages\\r\\nVandalur, mannivakkam, varadharajapuram likely to add in Greater Chennai corporation New City Limit.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreater Chennai Corporation limit will extend up to municipalities like Avadi, Tambaram, Pallavaram.

The executive wing is headed by the Commissioner. In addition, there are deputy commissioners, various heads of departments and 15 zonal officers.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first native Indian to govern the Madras Presidency as well as serve later as the first Mayor post-independence of erstwhile Madras was L. Sriramulu Naidu. Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state, houses the state executive and legislative headquarters primarily in the Secretariat Buildings on the Fort?St?George campus but also in several other buildings in the city. The Madras High Court, whose jurisdiction extends across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, is the highest judicial authority in the state. The district of Chennai has three parliamentary constituenciesChennai North, Chennai Central and Chennai Southand elects 18 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) to the state legislature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe metropolitan region of Chennai covers many suburbs that are part of Kanchipuram and Thiruvallur districts. The larger suburbs are governed by town municipalities, and the smaller ones are governed by town councils called panchayats. While the city covers an area of 174?km2 (67?mi2),[14] the metropolitan area is spread over 1,189?km2 (458?mi2).[15] The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has drafted a Second Master Plan that aims to develop satellite townships around the city. Contiguous satellite towns include Mahabalipuram to the south, Chengalpattu and Maraimalai Nagar to the southwest, and Kanchipuram , Sriperumpudur, Tiruvallur and Arakkonam to the west.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city is classified into three regions: North Chennai, Central Chennai and South Chennai.[16] It is further divided into 15 zones, consisting of 200 wards.[17] The newly annexed areas were divided into 93 wards, and the remaining 107 wards were created out of the original 155 within the old city limits.[18] As of  September?2011[update], the new wards are yet to be named.[17] Out of the 200 wards, 26 were reserved for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and 58 were reserved for women.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 15 Zones are:\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Chennai\\r\\n\\r\\nCentral Chennai\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Chennai\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Corporation has the following departments:[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the British period the Madras Corporation flag had the sea, boat, 3 lions and 2 fish. The 3 lions represented the British and the sea, boat, and fish denoted the seashore of madras. After Independence, the need for changing the flag arose. M.P. Sivagnanam (Ma. Po. Si.) who was heading the education wing of the corporation suggested the Pandiya, Chola, Cheras symbol Fish,Tiger and Bow (which he already had in his Tamil arasu kazhagams flag). Rajaji agreed with his suggestion.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greater Chennai Police department, a division of the Tamil Nadu Police, is the law enforcement agency in the city. The city police force is headed by a commissioner of police, and administrative control rests with the Tamil Nadu Home Ministry. The department consists of 36 subdivisions with a total of 121 police stations, of which 15 are ISO 9001:2000 certified.[21] The city's traffic is managed by the Chennai City Traffic Police (CCTP). The Metropolitan suburbs are policed by the Chennai Metropolitan Police, and outer district areas are policed by the Kanchipuram and Thiruvallur police departments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2012-13 revenue, the annual budgetary estimate of Chennai Corporation is ?13,261.1 million and expenditure is ?12,329.7 million. Surplus income of the corporation is ?931.4 million.[6] Property tax is the main source of revenue for Chennai corporation.[22] The corporation collects company tax from all incorporated companies in the city which transact business for 60 days or more in any half year.[23] The amount of tax levied varies from ? 500 to ? 30,000 per six months, based on the paid up capital of the company.[24] In 2012, the city has about 34,260 identified companies in its 15 zones, of which 5,196 companies has a paid-up capital of over ? 5 million.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nChennai Corporation area is located on the Coromandel Coast in the central eastern coastal region of the Deccan plateau and the northern end of the state of Tamil Nadu. The city stretches along the coast covering about 43?km of sandy beach and extending about 19?km inland, encompassing an area of 426?sq?km. The estimated population is about 6.5 million.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Corporation maintains roads, streetlights, and flyovers across the city[25][26][27] and also the city's cleanliness and hygiene levels.[28] It maintains 1,160 roads measuring a total of 370?km and storm water drain measuring 962?km and has 213,045 streetlights. Power consumption by the streetlights amounts to 50 megawatts a day, costing ? 14,00,000. The Corporation has 260 parks and maintains 113 community halls for public use. The corporation registers about 400 births and 180 deaths every day.[6] The Corporation also runs an abattoir.[29] There are 23,538 staffs working in the Corporation.[6] In 2011ÿ2012, ? 190 million was allotted by the Tamil Nadu government for the development of the city areas within corporation limits.[30] In 2014, the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) planned to change its 11-kilo volt transformers with 1,784 ring main units (RMUs) that are compact and safe.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Corporation maintains a total of 1,160 macadamised bus routes running to a total length of 353.94?km. Total length of interior roads measures about 5,563.06?km. Total length of cement concrete roads maintained by the Corporation in the bus routes measures 3.68?km and the length of cement concrete interior roads measures 1,292.54?km.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newly expanded region of the corporation alone has 2,752?km of roads, along which there is a 682.4-km network of storm water drains.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nStreet lamps in the city were introduced in 1785. Until the introduction of electric street lighting, the street lighting was done by oil lights. Till 1857, there were only 200 oil light lamps. By the year 1910, this was increased to 6,500. In 1910, electric street lighting was introduced. By 1924ÿ1925, all the oil lights in the streets of the city were completely replaced by electric lights. The Corporation also maintains 264 high-mast lights and 133 8-meter and 12-meter lamp posts with cluster lights at important junctions. The Corporation owns 22 hydraulic vehicles for attending maintenance work to streetlights.[33] In 2012, the Corporation started installing 60,000 streetlights in the newly included zones, in addition to replacing about 88,000 old streetlights in these zones.[34] Per the norm of the Corporation, the minimum distance between two adjacent streetlights is 25?metre.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs on 2012, the Corporation maintains 262 bridges, road-overbridges and road-underbridges, including 65 high-level bridges, 31 box culverts, 81 slab culverts, 11 rail-overbridges, 14 rail-underbridges, 6 pedestrian subways, 6 causeways, 35 footbridges and 13 grade separators.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, the Corporation acquired a Road Measurement Data Acquisition System (ROMDAS) to check the quality of newly laid roads.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nChennai has one of the lowest per capita green space in the country. As of 2012, It has only about 0.46 square metres per city dweller. According to the development rules, when plots measuring more than 10,000 square metres are developed, 10% of the area must be reserved as open space and gifted to the local bodies, and in plots measuring between 3,000 and 10,000 square metres, if gifting of 10% of the area as open space is not possible, cash equivalent can be paid. The money thus collected is utilized to develop the landscaping in the city.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1976, the Chennai Corporation has been collecting OSR charges and taking possession of land under the open space reservation rules. But so far it has not revealed what the total amount of land and cash collected. Data shows that since 2002, about 1.85 million square feet of land has been acquired.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Corporation maintains 260 public parks, 154 traffic islands, and 103 centre medians on major roads. Since the formation of the Corporation until 1947, the corporation had maintained 18 public play fields. As of 2012, the Corporation maintains 228 play fields, 234 gymnasiums, 4 shuttles indoor stadium, 1 basketball indoor stadium, and 2 swimming pools. Of the 228 play fields, about 14 have been designated as star play ground with facilities such as courts for football, tennis, volleyball, ball badminton, and basketball. The gymnasiums are used by about 50 to 100 people every day. Indoor shuttle courts are located in Mandaiveli, R. R. Colony in Jaffarkhanpet, Karpagam Avenue in Mylapore, and Nungambakkam. A basketball indoor stadium is located in Kilpauk Gardens. Swimming pools are located in Marina Beach and My Lady's Park. Skating rinks are located in Anna Nagar, Shenoy Nagar, Nungambakkam, Marina Beach, K. K. Nagar and T. Nagar.[39] The Corporation also maintains beaches within the city.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are about 13,787 lights installed and maintained in the park and play fields by the Corporation.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 322 schools run by the Corporation, with a total student count of 130,000.[7] As per 2012-2013 corporation budget, 30 new English medium primary and middle schools will be started.[41] The civic body has also planned to construct 64 additional buildings on existing school campuses that require more classrooms. In addition, libraries and a career guidance centre would be set up in all corporation high and higher secondary schools.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Corporation maintains 75 dispensaries, 36 malaria clinics, 42 tuberculosis microscopic centres, and 1 centre each for communicable diseases, NGO-run malaria clinic, filaria clinic, and filaria lymphodema management clinic. The Corporation maintains three slaughterhouses in Perambur, Villivakkam, and Saidapet, where an average of 1,500 sheep and 150 cattle are slaughtered every day.[7] As per 2012-2013 corporation budget, 11 new dental clinics will be set up in addition to the existing ones to ensure that every zone has a clinic.[41]  A new hospital will be set up with a specialised leprosy centre and Mandambakkam to benefit the residents of South Chennai.[41] In 2007, it was reported that mosquitoes were the biggest menace in the city.[42] In 2012, the Corporation announced that it was planning to breed sterile male mosquitoes to bring down the population of female mosquitoes.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Corporation maintains electric furnace units at the burial grounds at Villivakkam, Nungambakkam, GKM colony, and Arumbakkam. In addition, it also maintains gassifier furnace units at Moolakothalam, Kannammapet, Besant Nagar Mylapore, Kasimedu, Vyasarpadi, Otteri, Thangal, Velangadu, Krishnampet, Saidapet, and Besant Nagar burial grounds.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nHeaded by a Superintendent Engineer, the corporation is responsible for removal of solid waste within city limits. Every day, 4,500?metric tons of garbage is collected and removed from the city. Night conservancy is being carried out in all important roads and commercial areas of the city. In addition, door-to-door collection of garbage is followed in all zones in the city.[44] The waste is transported by 966 conservancy vehicles.[6] The corporation maintains dumping grounds at Kodungaiyur and Perungudi for dumping solid waste.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nChennai is hit by shortage of sanitary workers. To counter this, the corporation is to appoint 4,000 sanitary inspectors, junior engineers and assistant executive engineers in 2012.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nGarbage in most zones was previously handled by JBM Fanalca Environment Management, a private company, and by the Chennai Corporation in the other zones. Solid Waste management in several parts of the city was subsequently handed over to Chennai Municipal Solid Waste Pvt. Ltd a special purpose vehicle run by the Hyderabad-based Ramky Group for a period of seven years starting January 2012;[46] elsewhere, Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited is described as a private company.[47] The company is reportedly running at a loss and the Corporation was alleged to have paid only ?32.5?million of the ?65?million bill.[48] The company handles the three zones of Kodambakkam, Teynampet, and Adyar, also runs a Toll-free telelphone number to answer queries relating to waste management.[49] The company also performed street plays to spread awareness on keeping the city clean.[50] The Corporation later decided to take penal action against the private agency for not keeping up its end of the deal.[51] In September, a show cause notice for termination of the contract was served, which was further upheld by the Madras High Court.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other zones, the Corporation looks after the removal and processing of solid waste in the others,[53] with a superintendent engineer managing the channels. As of 2011, 8 transfer stations exist within the city for treating the waste.[54] Garbage is dumped in two dump-yards in the cityOne in Kodungaiyur and another in Perungudi, with a major portion of the latter covering the Pallikaranai marshland.[55] In market areas, the conservancy work is done during the night.[56] Water supply and sewage treatment are handled by the Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewage Board, popularly referred to as Metro Water. Electricity is supplied by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board.[57] Fire services are handled by the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Service.[58] The city, along with the suburbs, has 33 operating fire stations.[59] The city's telephone service is provided by four landline companies: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), Tata Indicom, Reliance Communications and Bharti Airtel.[60] There are six mobile phone companies: BSNL, Vodafone Essar, Bharti Airtel and Aircel, which offer GSM services, and Tata Indicom and Reliance Communications, which offer code division multiple access (CDMA) services.[61] Broadband Internet access is provided by Sify, BSNL, Reliance Communications, Hathway, Bharti Airtel[62] and Tata Indicom through cables or WiMAX.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city generates 4,500 tonnes of garbage every day. The city has three dumpyards, one each at Perungudi, Kodungaiyur, and Pallikaranai. The corporation has planned to close these yards and create four new dumpyards at Malaipattu, Minjur, Vallur, and Kuthambakkam villages, ranging in size from 20 acres to 100 acres.[63][64] According to studies by the civic body, green waste and wood account for 39 percent of the city's garbage and food waste around 8 percent. The civic body also spends ?4 billion (US$58?million) a year on solid waste management.[65] The corporation is planning to create a 200-acre park at the 269-acre Kodungaiyur dump yard and a 150-acre park at the 200-acre Perungudi dumpsite.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, Chennai has relied on annual monsoon rains to replenish water reservoirs, as no major rivers flow through the area. Steadily growing in population, the city has faced water supply shortages, and its ground water levels have been depleted. Many residents buy water for drinking as well as other daily uses. An earlier Veeranam Lake project failed to solve the city's water problems, but the New Veeranam project, which became operational in September 2004, has greatly reduced dependency on distant sources.[67] In recent years, heavy and consistent monsoon rains and rainwater harvesting (RWH) by Chennai Metrowater at its Anna Nagar Rain Centre have significantly reduced water shortages. The Metrowater methods have become a model of RWH technology for other cities.[68] Moreover, newer projects like the Telugu Ganga project that bring water from water-surplus rivers like the Krishna River in Andhra Pradesh have eased water shortages. The city is constructing sea water desalination plants to further increase the water supply.[69][70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city's water supply and sewage treatment are managed by the Chennai MetroWater Supply and Sewage Board. Water is drawn from Red Hills Lake and Chembarambakkam Lake, the primary water reservoirs of the city,[71] and treated at water treatment plants located at Kilpauk, Puzhal, Chembarambakkam[72] and supplied to the city through 27 water distribution stations.[73] The city receives 530 mld of water from Krishna River through Telugu Ganga project, 180 mld of water from the Veeranam lake project[72] and 100 mld of water from the Minjur desalination plant, the country's largest sea water desalination plant.[74][75][76] However, Chennai is predicted to face a huge deficit of 713 million litres per day (MLD) in 2026 as the demand is projected at 2,248 MLD and supply estimated at only 1,535 MLD.[77] There are 714 public toilets in the city managed by the city corporation,[78] and 2,000 more has been planned by the corporation.[79] The corporation also owns 52 community halls across the city.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2014, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) adjudged the Chennai Corporation as the best among all the government departments in terms of e-governance.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nRipon building","input":"Which is the oldest municipal corporation in india?"},{"output":"Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen)","context":"","input":"Who was the female lead in indiana jones?"},{"output":"in the second half of the 9th century, when Norse settlers migrated across the North Atlantic","context":"The age of settlement of Iceland (Icelandic: landnms?ld) is generally believed to have begun in the second half of the 9th century, when Norse settlers migrated across the North Atlantic. The reasons for the migration may be traced to a shortage of arable land in Scandinavia and civil strife brought about by the ambitions of the Norwegian king Harald I of Norway. Unlike the British Isles, Iceland was unsettled land and could be claimed without conflict with existing inhabitants.\\r\\nOn the basis of slendingab܇k by Ari Thorgilsson, and Landnmab܇k, the years 870 and 874 have traditionally been considered the first years of settlement. Historian Gunnar Karlsson notes that these sources are largely unreliable in terms of dating settlement.[1] Traditionally, the Icelandic Age of Settlement is considered to have lasted from 874 to 930, at which point most of the island had been claimed and Altingi (Althingi), the assembly of the Icelandic Commonwealth, was founded in Tingvellir (Thingvellir). Almost everything known about the first settlers comes from slendingab܇k, and Landnmab܇k, two historical records preserved in skin manuscripts. Estimates of the number of initial settlers range between 311 and 436.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe slendingab܇k of Ari Thorgilsson claims that the Norse settlers encountered Gaelic monks from a Hiberno-Scottish mission when they arrived in Iceland. There is some archaeological evidence for a monastic settlement from the British Isles at Kverkarhellir cave, on the Seljaland farm in southern Iceland. Sediment deposits indicate people lived there around 800, and crosses consistent with the Hiberno-Scottish style were carved in the wall of a nearby cave.[3][4][5] The oldest known source which mentions the name \\"Iceland\\" is an 11th-century rune carving from Gotland, while the oldest archeological finds indicating settlement date back to the 9th century. The first written source to mention the existence of Iceland is a book by the Goidelic monk Dicuil, De mensura orbis terrae, which dates back to 825. Dicuilus claimed to have met some monks who had lived on the island of Thule. They said that darkness reigned during winter but that the summers were bright enough to pick lice from one's clothing. While the veracity of this source may be questioned, there is little doubt that the inhabitants of the British Isles were aware of a sizeable land mass far up north. Additionally, Iceland is only about 450?kilometres from the Faroes which had been visited by Irish monks in the 6th century, and settled by the Norse around 650.\\r\\nA cabin in Hafnir was abandoned between 770 and 880, showing that it was built well before the traditional settlement date of 874. It is thought to have been an outpost only inhabited part of the year, but it is not known whether it was built by people from Scandinavia or the British Isles.[6]\\r\\nThe Landnmab܇k claims that the first Norseman to rest his feet on Icelandic soil was a viking by the name of Naddoddr. Naddoddr stayed for only a short period of time, but gave the country a name: Sn?land (Land of Snow). He was followed by the Swede Garear Svavarsson, who was the first to stay over winter. At some time around 860, a storm pushed his ship far to the north until he reached the eastern coast of Iceland. Garear approached the island from the east, sailed westward along the coast and then up north, building a house in H~savk. He completed a full circle, circumnavigating the island and establishing that the landmass in question was indeed an island. He departed the following summer, never to return but not before giving the island a new name -- Garearsh܇lmur (literally, Garear's Island). One of his men, Nttfari, decided to stay behind with two slaves. Nttfari settled in what is now known as Nttfaravk, close to Skjlfandi. Landnmab܇k maintains that Nttfari was not a permanent settler.\\r\\nThere was a man by the name Fl܇ki Vilgerearson. He was a great Viking. He left to find Garearsh܇lmur.  Landnmab܇k\\r\\nThe second Norseman to arrive in Iceland was named Fl܇ki Vilgerearson, but the year of his arrival is not clear. According to the story told in Landnmab܇k, he took three ravens to help him find his way. Thus, he was nicknamed Raven-Fl܇ki (Icelandic: Hrafna-Fl܇ki). Fl܇ki set his ravens free near the Faroe Islands. The first raven flew back to the Faroes. The second flew up in the air and then returned to the ship. However, the third flew in front of the ship and they followed its direction to Iceland.\\r\\nHe landed in Vatnsfj?reur in the Westfjords after passing what is now Reykjavk. One of his men, Faxi, remarked that they seemed to have found great landthe bay facing Reykjavk is therefore known as Faxafl܇i. A harsh winter caused all of Fl܇ki's cattle to diehe cursed this cold country, and when he spotted a drift ice in the fjord he decided to name it \\"sland\\" (Iceland). Despite difficulties in finding food, he and his men stayed another year, this time in Borgarfj?reur, but they headed back to Norway the following summer. Fl܇ki would return much later and settle in what is now known as Fl܇kadalur.\\r\\nAnother Norseman, by the name of Ing܇lfur Arnarson, had instigated a blood feud in his homeland, Norway. He and his foster-brother Hj?rleifur went on an exploratory expedition to Iceland, and stayed over winter in what is now lftafj?reur. A few years later they returned to settle the land with their men. When they approached the island, Ing܇lfur cast his high seat pillars overboard and swore that he would settle where they drifted to shore. He then sent his slaves Vfill and Karli to search for the pillars. They found his foster-brother Hj?rleifur murdered, and all his men gone. Ing܇lfur gave his foster-brother a heathen funeral in the Norse style and slew the murderers, who had fled to the Westman Islands.\\r\\nAs winter approached, Ing܇lfur's slaves found the pillars by Arnarhvol. When summer came, he built a farmstead in Reykjavk and claimed all the land west of the rivers of ?lfus, ?xar and Brynjudals. His slave Karli did not care for the location, and said to Ing܇lfur: \\"How ill that we should pass good land, to settle in this remote peninsula.\\"\\r\\nWritten sources consider the age of settlement in Iceland to have begun with Ing܇lfur's settlement, for he was the first to sail to Iceland with the purpose of settling the land. He was followed by many otherswithin about sixty years, all the usable land had been taken. Landnmab܇k manuscripts mention 1,500 farm and place names, and more than 3,500 people. The material is arranged in a geographical fashion and seems to give a relatively complete picture of how the country was settled. Academic estimates of the number of people who migrated to the country during the Age of Settlement range between 4.300-24.000.[8] Archeological evidence strongly suggests that the timing of settlement, as described in Landnmab܇k, is roughly accurate; \\"that the whole country was occupied within a couple of decades towards the end of the 9th century.\\"[9]\\r\\nA number of reasons have been offered for the settlement of Iceland:[10]\\r\\nThe notion that population pressure drove migration to Iceland remains unsupported in the academic literature.[10]\\r\\nWritten sources say some settlers took land freely, others bought lands from earlier settlers, some were gifted land by earlier settlers, and that some settlers took lands from others through the use of force or threat of force. Lands were likely not rented during the Age of settlement. Medievalist Hans Kuhn argued that lands were given away or taken freely because earlier settlers had no need for such extensive lands. Historian Gunnar Karlsson notes that it could be rational for earlier settlers to encourage new settlers to settle lands nearby so as to ease maintenance of cattle and slaves, and as insurance in times of crisis.[11]\\r\\nControversial results of recent carbon dating work, published in the journal Skrnir, suggest that the country may have been settled as early as the second half of the 7th century.[12]\\r\\nAri Thorgilsson claims in slendingab܇k that the country had been \\"fully settled\\" in 930. The age of settlement is considered to have ended in the year 930 with the establishment of Altingi.[10] Archeological evidence shows however \\"that immigrants continued to arrive in Iceland throughout the 10th century\\".[9] The authors of one study speculate that \\"continued immigration may have been needed to sustain the population\\".[9]\\r\\nThe Icelandic Commonwealth is considered to have begun in 930.\\r\\nScholars have argued that the settlers caused soil erosion through extensive deforestation and overgrazing.[13] One study suggests that the primary motive for the deforestation was \\"clearance for pastures and home-fields\\", not the \\"settlers requirements for fuel and building material\\".[14]","input":"When was iceland believed to be first inhabited?"},{"output":"roughly a decade before the events of the original Star Trek series and separate from the timeline of the concurrently produced feature films","context":"Star Trek: Discovery is an American television series created for CBS All Access by Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman. It is the first series developed specifically for that service, and the first Star Trek series since Star Trek: Enterprise concluded in 2005. Set roughly a decade before the events of the original Star Trek series and separate from the timeline of the concurrently produced feature films, Discovery explores the FederationÿKlingon war while following the crew of the USS Discovery.

The new series was announced in November 2015, with Fuller joining as showrunner and wanting to make an anthology series. CBS asked him to make a single, serialized show first, with the prequel to the original series idea further developed. After further disagreements with CBS and struggles with other commitments, Fuller left the series in October 2016, replaced as showrunner by Berg and Harberts.\\r\\nStar Trek: Discovery premiered on September 19, 2017, at ArcLight Hollywood, before debuting on CBS and All Access on September 24. The rest of the 15-episode first season are streaming weekly on All Access. The series' release led to record subscriptions for All Access, and positive reviews from critics who highlighted Martin-Green's performance. A second season was ordered in October 2017.\\r\\nSet roughly ten years before the events of Star Trek: The Original Series,[1] the show sees the united Klingon houses in a war with the United Federation of Planets that involves the crew of the USS Discovery.[2][3]\\r\\nOn November 2, 2015, CBS announced a new Star Trek television series to premiere in January 2017, \\"on the heels\\" of the original series' 50th anniversary in 2016. It is the first Star Trek series since Star Trek: Enterprise concluded in 2005, and the first show to be developed specifically for the CBS All Access on demand service. Alex Kurtzman, co-writer of the films Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness, and Heather Kadin were set as executive producers on the series, which is \\"not related\\" to the 2016 film Star Trek Beyond.[28][29] The January 2017 date was the earliest that CBS could release a new Star Trek series after an agreement the company made when it split with Viacom in 2005.[30] Showtime, Netflix, and Amazon Video all offered \\"a lot of money\\" for the rights to release the series,[31] but after heavily investing in the new All Access service, CBS believed that a returning Star Trek could be \\"the franchise that really puts All Access on the map\\" and could earn more money in the long run.[30][31]\\r\\nIn January 2016, CBS president Glenn Geller revealed that he and the CBS network were not involved in the production of the series, saying, \\"It really is for All Access. While the network will be broadcasting the pilot, I actually can't answer any creative questions about it.\\"[32] The next month, Bryan Fuller, who began his career writing for the series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager, was announced as the new series' showrunner and co-creator alongside Kurtzman.[33][34] Nicholas Meyer, writer and director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, also joined the series as a writer and consulting producer.[35] In March, Rod Roddenberry, the son of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, and Trevor Roth of Roddenberry Entertainment also joined the series, as executive producers.[36] Fuller said that working with people previously involved with Star Trek was \\"really about making sure that we maintain authenticity\\", and said that Meyerwho is widely considered to have made the best Star Trek film in The Wrath of Khanbrings \\"a clarity and a cleanliness to the storytelling. An ability to ground science-fiction in a relatable way, and also making sure that we're telling character stories.\\"[37] Fuller had publicly called for Star Trek to return to television for years, particularly because of its impact on minority groups, as he explained, \\"I couldn't stop thinking about how many black people were inspired by seeing Nichelle Nichols on the bridge of a ship. I couldn't stop thinking about how many Asian people were inspired by seeing George Takei and feeling that gave them hope for their place in the future. I wanted to be part of that representation for a new era.\\"[38] When Fuller first met with CBS about the series, the company did not have a plan for what the new show would be.[39] He proposed an anthology series with each season being a standalone, serialized show set in a different era, beginning with a prequel to the original series, then stories set during the original series, during Star Trek: The Next Generation, and then \\"beyond to a time in Trek that's never been seen before\\". Fuller compared this to what American Horror Story did for horror, and described the proposal as a platform for \\"a universe of Trek shows\\". However, CBS told Fuller to just start with a single serialized show and see how that performs first, and he began further developing the concept of a prequel to the original series.[38]\\r\\nFuller announced in June 2016 that the first season would consist of 13 episodes,[39] though he would prefer to produce 10 episodes a season moving forward.[6] A month later, Fuller announced the series' title to be Star Trek: Discovery,[40] and revealed that it would be set in the \\"Prime Timeline\\" (which includes the previous Star Trek series, but not the modern reboot films) to keep the concurrent series and films separate, so \\"we don't have to track anything [happening in the films] and they don't have to track what we're doing\\".[41][6] Also in July, CBS Studios International licensed the series to Netflix for release outside the United States and Canada,[34] a \\"blockbuster\\" deal that paid for the show's entire budget (around US$6ÿ7 million per episode).[42][43] During pre-production on the series, Fuller and CBS continued to disagree on the direction of the show, which was starting to overrun its per-episode budget, and was falling behind schedule due to Fuller supervising all aspects of the series as well as another new show, American Gods. This caused frustration among CBS executives who felt Fuller should be focused on having Discovery ready for release by the January 2017 premiere date.[38] By August 2016, Fuller had hired Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts, who he had worked with on Pushing Daisies, to serve as co-showrunners with him.[6][43] A month later, he and Kurtzman asked CBS to delay the series' release so they could meet the high expectations for it, and the studio pushed the series premiere back to May 2017.\\"[44] At the end of October, CBS asked Fuller to step down as showrunner,[38] and announced a restructuring of the production: Berg and Harberts were made sole showrunners, working from a broad story arc and overall mythology established by Fuller; Kurtzman and Fuller would continue as executive producers, but with Fuller moving his attention fully to American Gods; and Akiva Goldsman would join the series in a supporting producer role, similar to the role he held on Fringe alongside Kurtzman. CBS reiterated that they were \\"extremely happy with [Fuller's] creative direction\\" for the series,[43] though some elements of the series that came directly from Fuller were dropped, including some designs and \\"more heavily allegorical and complex story\\" points.[38] Fuller later confirmed that he was no longer involved with the series, but expressed interest in returning for future seasons.[45]\\r\\nWith production set to finally begin in January, \\"a lot of careful deliberation [was] continuing to go into making Discovery special, from the choice of directors, to set design, to the special effects.\\"[46] Ted Sullivan also joined the series to serve as supervising writing producer.[47][48] At CBS's 2017 upfront presentation, CBS Interactive president Marc DeBevoise confirmed a \\"fall\\" release date for the series, and announced that the episode order for the first season had been expanded to 15 episodes.[49][50] In June, CBS announced a new premiere date of September 24, 2017, with the season airing through November 2017, and then beginning again in January 2018. This break gave more time to complete post-production on the second half of the season.[24] Also that month, Kurtzman said that he and Fuller had discussed future seasons before the latter's departure, and promised that \\"what's there in terms of story and certainly in terms of set-up, character, big ideas, the big movement of the season, that's all stuff that Bryan and I talked about\\" and would not be altered.[51] Goldsman said in August that the producers wanted \\"a hybridized [anthology] approach. I don't think we're looking for an endless, continuing nine or 10 year story. We're looking at arcs which will have characters that we know and characters that we don't know.\\"[8] Kurtzman added that the success of Discovery could lead to other new Star Trek series that could potentially use the anthology format.[52] By the end of August, Berg and Harberts had developed a \\"road map\\" for a second season, and \\"the beginnings of one\\" for a third. It was also revealed that an average episode of the first season had ultimately cost US$8ÿ8.5 million each, making it one of the most expensive television series ever and exceeding the original Netflix deal, though CBS still considered the series to be paid for already due to the number of new All Access subscribers that the show was expected to draw.[53] After the series' premiere, Kurtzman said that the producers wanted to avoid announcing release dates and having to delay those for any future seasons, due to the external pressure that caused with the first season, but that he hoped a second season would be available in early 2019.[54] The second season was officially ordered a month later in October 2017.[55]\\r\\nThe series' writers are based in Los Angeles,[57] and include \\"fans who all have very different relationships to Trek,\\" which Kurtzman said is \\"a healthy thing and it's a good thing\\".[51] Fuller wanted to differentiate the series from the previous 700+ episodes of Star Trek by taking advantage of the streaming format of All Access and telling a single story arc across the entire first season. He and Kurtzman developed this story from \\"so many elements of Star Trek\\", taking certain episodes of the original series and using their \\"DNA\\" to find \\"the spirit of what Star Trek offers, both in terms of high-concept science fiction storytelling and really wonderful metaphors for the human condition\\".[39] Berg said that the series' writers \\"are so in love with\\" The Original Series, The Next Generation, and the family aspect of those series, while Harberts added that Meyer's Star Trek films were an especial influence on Discovery because \\"his storytelling is complex and intellectual and yet there's a lot of room for character voices\\".[58]\\r\\nThe titular ship was named after Discovery One from 2001: A Space Odyssey, NASA's Space Shuttle Discovery, and \\"the sense of discovery ... what [that] means to Star Trek audiences who have been promised a future by Gene Roddenberry where we come together as a planet and seek new worlds and new alien races to explore and understand and collaborate with\\".[59] Fuller saw the series as a bridge between Enterprise and the original serieswhich are set around 150 years apartbut set much closer to the latter to allow the series to \\"play with all the iconography of those ships and those uniforms\\".[60] In May 2017, Sullivan described the series as \\"a genuine prequel\\" to the original series,[61] with Goldsman later adding that there were many classic Star Trek elements that fans among the writers wished to include in the series, but couldn't because they were included in the original series as something being discovered by Starfleet for the first time then.[62] The choice to feature a single serlialized story throughout the first season was inspired by the general change in television to tell more realistic and serialized stories rather than the \\"new destination-based adventure each week\\" format mostly used in previous Star Trek series. Fuller had been one of several writers during the 1990s pushing for Deep Space Nine and Voyager to move towards this style.[63] Also inspired by modern, \\"peak television\\" series such as Game of Thrones was a willingness to kill off major characters for dramatic reasons, though the writers wanted to avoid doing so gratuitously or for \\"shock value\\".[64]\\r\\nFuller said the series could \\"push the content envelope since it won't be constrained by broadcast standards\\", but \\"it's still Star Trek. It will probably be slightly more graphic content ... I imagine we're going to shoot scenes a couple of ways and see what feels more authentic in the editing room.\\"[1] Harberts ultimately described the series as a \\"hard PG-13\\", saying the series could include \\"some violent things or [a] tiny bit of language\\" but they still wanted the show to be for families and to \\"honor what the franchise is.\\"[65] On using time travel in the series, a plot device used in at least two episodes of every previous live-action Star Trek season, Fuller said that it had not yet been used for any episode by the end of August 2016, and, \\"You never know when you want to pull out that device but I am not anticipating an over-reliance on time travel to tell this season's stories.\\"[6] The series' writers also chose to ignore Gene Roddenberry's longstanding rule that Starfleet crew members not have any significant conflict with one another or be depicted negatively (a rule that Roddenberry himself did not always strictly follow). Harberts explained, \\"We're trying to do stories that are complicated, with characters with strong points of view and strong passions. People have to make mistakesmistakes are still going to be made in the future. We're still going to argue in the future ... the thing we're taking from Roddenberry is how we solve those conflicts.\\"[63] Because of the show's position as a prequel to the original series, the producers felt it was more important for Discovery to build towards Roddenberry's ideals, and to show that \\"you can't simply be accepting and tolerant without working for it, and so this show is about that struggle.\\"[62]\\r\\nBy June 2016, Fuller had met with several actors, and said that \\"we want to carry on what Star Trek does best, which is being progressive. So it's fascinating to look at all of these roles through a colorblind prism and a gender-blind prism\\".[39] A month later, Kadin clarified that the series would feature minority, female, and LGBTQ characters.[66] In August, Fuller said the series would feature \\"about seven\\" lead characters,[67] and would star a lieutenant commander, rather than a starship captain like previous Star Trek series, to be played by a non-white actress. He said the series would also include more alien characters than other Star Trek series, and would feature at least one openly gay character. Fuller, who is gay himself, had been determined to see this happen since receiving hate mail while working on Voyager when a character on that show was rumored to be coming out as gay.[1] By this time, Fuller had discussed the series' casting with Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space (who made a cameo appearance in an episode of The Next Generation).[1][68]\\r\\nFuller anticipated casting announcements in October 2016,[6] but none had been made by the end of that month. The majority of the series main characters were believed to have been cast by then, but no actress had been cast for the series' lead role. This was a source of \\"some internal stress\\" at CBS.[43] Several African American and Latina actresses were being looked at for the role, with CBS \\"not seeking a huge star and [preferring] a fresh face for the part.\\"[69] In October, the cast was believed to include \\"a female admiral, a male Klingon captain, a male admiral, a male adviser and a British male doctor\\", with one of those male leads played by an openly gay actor.[70] The next month, Doug Jones and Anthony Rapp were revealed to be cast, as Science Officers Saru and Stamets, respectively.[9] The former is a Kelpien, an alien race created for the series,[10] while the latter is the first Star Trek character to be conceived and announced as gay.[9] Sonequa Martin-Green was cast in the lead role in December,[71] which was officially confirmed in April 2017, with the character's name revealed to be Michael Burnham.[5] Also in December, Shazad Latif was cast as the Klingon Kol.[72] In March 2017, Jason Isaacs was cast as Captain Lorca of the USS Discovery,[21] and Mary Wiseman joined as Tilly, a cadet.[18] At the end of April, Latif was revealed to have been recast to the role of Starfleet Lieutenant Tyler.[12]\\r\\nMark Worthington and Todd Cherniawsky served as initial production designers for the series;[73] Gersha Phillips and Suttirat Anne Larlarb designed the costumes;[3][74] veteran Star Trek designer John Eaves designed starships, along with Scott Schneider;[75][76] and Glenn Hetrick and Neville Page of Alchemy Studios provided prosthetics, props, and armor.[3][77] Page previously served as the concept and creature designer on the three \\"Kelvin Timeline\\" Star Trek films.[78] The series also employed seven art directors, over nine illustrators, more than thirty-five set designers, and over four hundred and fifty painters, carpenters, sculptors, model makers, welders, set dressers, and prop builders.[76]\\r\\nFuller said on the general approach to design on the show, \\"we're producing the show in 2016. We have to update the style of the effects, the style of the sets, the style of the makeup ... all of the other series have been produced [at a time that] isn't as sophisticated as we are now with what we can do production-wise, we're going to be reestablishing an entire look for the series\\" and for Star Trek moving forward.[1] Fuller had wanted the series' uniforms to reflect the primary colors of the original series, but this was discarded after his departure.[38] However, Fuller's designs for the Klingons, which he \\"really, really wanted\\" to redesign, were retained.[8][2] 3D Systems' \\"cutting edge\\" 3D printing techniques were widely used in the making of the series.[3][78] For the prosthetics, Page and Hetrick took detailed laser scans of the actors so they could simulate make-up and prosthetics in a virtual environment before creating the practical version.[79] Fabric for the Starfleet uniforms seen in the series were custom-dyed in Switzerland; the costumes were cut and assembled in Toronto by Phillips and her department. The main uniforms seen in the series are a navy blue specifically mixed for the show, with gold or silver embellishments depending on the division of the officer. Medical officers wear a \\"hospital white\\" variant, also custom-dyed in Switzerland, while the captain's uniform is the standard navy blue but with additional gold piping on the shoulders.[80] Starfleet insignia badges were molded from silicon bronze, and then polished and plated by a jeweler to create custom colors for the series, based on the division of the officer wearing the uniform: gold for command, silver for sciences and medical, and copper for operations. Props such as tricorders and hand scanners, communicators, and phasers were produced with 3D printing and heavily inspired by their designs in the original Star Trek series.[80]\\r\\nThe design of the USS Discovery is based on an unused Ralph McQuarrie design for the USS Enterprise from the unproduced film Star Trek: Planet of the Titans, which Fuller had noted in July 2016 was \\"to a point that we can't legally comment on it until [our legal team] figures out some things\\".[41] McQuarrie's designs were based on the concepts created by Ken Adam to feature a vessel with a flattened secondary hull.[81][82] Fuller wanted \\"something distinct about what our Star Trek was going to look\\" like, and after seeing McQuarrie's design \\"saw sort of harder lines of a ship and started talking about race cars and Lamborghinis in the '70s and James Bond cars and started working on the designs, taking those inspirations and coming up with something completely unique to us.\\"[83] The design for the Discovery went through several revisions and refinements before the final version was approved in December 2016.[84] The sickbay on the Discovery was inspired by that of the Enterprise from the original series.[85] Other Federation starships created for the show include the USS Shenzhou and the USS Europa.[86][87] Sets for the Discovery's interiors were described as a \\"tangle of corridors and rooms\\",[53] and were designed to match with the exterior design of the ship, so \\"the rooms [could believably] fit inside the house\\", but there was some artistic license taken in places. The graphics used for the Starfleet computer systems were designed to be believably more advanced than modern technology, but to also \\"honor the look and feel\\" of the designs used in previous series. The initial colors allowed for the graphics were mostly restricted to blues, with the intention of these becoming more colorful the closer the series gets to the time period of the original series.[76]\\r\\nStar Trek: Discovery is filmed at Pinewood Toronto Studios,[88] with Vincenzo Natali serving as producing director for the series.[39] Some of the series' sets took over six weeks to create,[86] and new sets were being built up until the end of production of the season.[89] Discovery took advantage of multiple soundstages at the studio, including the largest soundstage in North America.[53] Some episodes for the show were filmed solely on existing sets, making them bottle episodes, though Harberts said the series would not do anything \\"as bottle-y as 'everyone is stuck in the mess hall!'\\"[89]\\r\\nFor the visual scope of the series, Kurtzman felt that the show had to \\"justify being on a premium cable service\\".[90] The showrunners were particularly inspired by Star Trek: The Motion Picture and its \\"wider scope\\", with Harberts explaining that the series is shot in a 2:1 aspect ratio which \\"just lends itself to a very lyrical way of telling the story.\\" He added that some of the series' visuals were influenced by the modern Star Trek films from J. J. Abrams.[58] Some of these influences, per Goldsman, are \\"the ability to be creative cinematicallythe intimate discourse, the humanistic storytelling with the giant canvas that is Star Trek. A more kinetic camera, a more dynamic way of existing, a much greater use of practical sets so when youre running down a corridor, youre running down a corridor. A sense of rhythmthere is a sense of litheness, a kind of fluidity in the characterizations.\\"[91] The producers worked closely with pilot director David Semel to make the series look as cinematic as possible, including filming the bridge of Starfleet's ships in such a way as \\"not to shoot in a sort of proscenium boxto be able to get the camera into spaces where, you know, to shoot it in interesting ways, which is a combination of choreographing a scene to motivate the camera moving, and also lighting.\\"[56] The cinematographers for the series wanted to emphasize on set sourcing, with lighting built in wherever it would naturally appear to help create a more realistic feel, and distance the series from the \\"stage\\" feel of the original series.[89] The lighting could also be controlled to create completely different situations, such as the lighting of a Starfleet red alert.[76] Harberts said that the cinematographers wanted the series to have a \\"Rembrandt texture\\".[89]\\r\\nVisual effects producers were hired to begin work on the series during the initial writing period, with Fuller explaining that the series would require such things as \\"digital augmentation on certain alien species\\" and \\"the transporter beams\\". He said, \\"We're trying to cultivate distinct looks for all of those things that are unique to our version of Star Trek and carry through the themes we love seeing in fifty years of Star Trek, but doing a slightly different approach.\\"[39] Pixomondo is the primary visual effects vendor for the series,[87] with Spin VFX also working on the show.[92] Kurtzman noted that the series utilizes multiple CG environments which take several months to properly render.[56] The shuttle bay of the Discovery is completely computer-generated, with actors performing in front of a green screen for scenes in that environment; using the digital set is more expensive than any other set created for the series, including the practically-built ones.[93]\\r\\nThe first teaser for the series featured music composed by Fil Eisler, which he \\"threw together as an audition\\" within three weeks.[66] Before production on the series began, Charles Henri Avelange had also composed and recorded music for the series, which he described as \\"a showcase for CBS\\".[94] In July 2017, Jeff Russo was announced as composer for the series.[7] Russo recorded the series' score with a 60-piece orchestra.[90] The show's main theme incorporates elements from the original Star Trek theme.[62]\\r\\nThe first episode of Star Trek: Discovery aired in a \\"preview broadcast\\" on CBS in the United States on September 24, as well as being made available with the second episode on CBS All Access. Subsequent first-run episodes, making up the first chapter of the season, will be streamed weekly on All Access through November 12. The second chapter will begin streaming January 2018.[24][25][95]\\r\\nCBS Studios International licensed the series to Bell Media for broadcast in Canada, and to Netflix for another 188 countries.[34] In Canada, the premiere was simulcast with CBS on September 24, 2017, on both the CTV Television Network and on the specialty channel Space before being streamed on CraveTV; it was also broadcast in French on the specialty channel Z.[34] Subsequent episodes will be released through Space, Z, and CraveTV,[34] with Space airing each episode 30 minutes before it's streamed on All Access.[96][97] In the other countries, Netflix will release each episode of the series for streaming within 24 hours of its U.S. debut.[34] This agreement also saw Bell Media and Netflix acquire all previous Star Trek series to stream in their entirety, and to broadcast on Bell Media television channels.[34]\\r\\nThe first full trailer for the series was released in May 2017.[98] Forbes's Merrill Barr noted that the trailer was a good sign for many who believed the series would never be released following the many production setbacks and delays, saying, \\"Having a legitimate trailer that can be watched over and over again brings signs of hope, particularly for fans that have been waiting over a year for this moment. Star Trek: Discovery is real, and now we have proof.\\"[99] Chris Harnick of E! News described the trailer as \\"gorgeous\\" and \\"truly cinematic\\", and because of the appearances of Sarek and the Klingons in the footage, \\"this is the Star Trek you know and love.\\"[100] Aja Romano at Vox called the trailer's visuals \\"sumptuous\\" and \\"modern, but still very much in keeping with the aesthetic of previous Trek series\\". She continued, \\"What gets short shrift in this trailer is the series' overarching plot ... In any case, seeing the Klingons in all their combative glory feels a bit like coming home for Trek fans.\\"[101] Also in May, McFarlane Toys signed a toy license deal with CBS to produce \\"figures, role play weapons and accessories\\" for Discovery. CBS Consumer Products senior vice president Veronica Hart explained that McFarlane was chosen as the first licensee for the series because of its \\"commitment to quality and dedication to fans\\". The deal will also see the company \\"create merchandise from the entire Star Trek universe, ranging from the classic Star Trek: The Original Series to its popular movie franchise.\\" The first merchandise produced under the deal are set for release in mid-2018.[102]\\r\\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the CBS broadcast of the first episode was watched by a \\"decent\\" audience of 9.5 million viewers.[103][104] The premiere of the series led to record subscriptions for All Access, with the service having its biggest day of signups, as well as its biggest week and month of signups thanks to the series.[105] According to \\"app analytics specialist\\" App Annie, the premiere of the series also caused the number of downloads of the All Access mobile app to more than double, with revenue from the app for CBS doubling compared to the average in-app revenue during the previous 30 days.[106]\\r\\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 83% approval rating for the first season, with an average rating of 7.13/10 based on 51 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Although it takes an episode to achieve liftoff, Star Trek: Discovery delivers a solid franchise installment for the next generationboldly led by the charismatic Sonequa Martin-Green.\\"[107] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 72 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[108]\\r\\nBy July 2016, CBS was working on an aftershow companion series to Discovery similar in format to AMC's Talking Dead, a companion to The Walking Dead. The show would air live after each episode of Discovery, and would feature \\"guests, celebrity Trekkies, former Star Trek actors, along with cast members and crew\\" from Discovery.[109] The companion series was confirmed in 2017, with the title After Trek and host Matt Mira. It is produced by Embassy Row in association with Roddenberry Entertainment.[110]\\r\\nIn September 2016, Discovery writer Kirsten Beyer announced that CBS was working with IDW and Simon & Schuster to produce more content revolving around the setting of the series, starting with at least one novel and a comic series tied to the television show. Beyer, the writer of many Star Trek: Voyager novels, explained that she would work with fellow Star Trek novelist David Mack and Star Trek comic writer Mike Johnson to ensure that all three media \\"are coming from the same place\\". The release of the books and comics was set to coincide with the series' premiere.[111] Mack described writing around the continuity of Discovery as \\"tricky to get right\\", as the time period \\"is light on detail and almost unique within the Star Trek continuity. That made it a challenge to represent that era faithfully while also staying true to the new elements being introduced\\" in the new series.[112]\\r\\nIn August 2017, Beyer explained the series' writers' intentions for the additional content, saying, \\"We want to be able to take the story opportunities that we're just frankly not going to have time to cover in the show, and go as deep into those into the various formats as we can. It's not that you have to read these stories to understand everything, but the story will be incredibly enhanced if you do.\\" Regarding whether this content would be considered canonical, Beyer said that the stories of the comics and novels are briefed back to the show's writing staff so \\"the stories we created get integrated into their brains\\", but she also said, \\"Because of the collaborative nature of this process, we're able to go farther, take bigger risks. The danger is that, in the future, somebody will come upon with an amazing story idea that would be incompatible with what we've already established and just like always, the series is going to take priority. But the hope is that we can carve out these places that are safe and that we can continue to protect because as much as possible we want this to be one integrated universewe're doing what we can to make sure these stories all fit together moving forward.\\"[113]\\r\\nThe first tie-in to the show is Desperate Hours, a prequel set a year before Discovery and a year after \\"The Cage\\". Written by Mack, the novel is set for release on September 26, and follows Burnham as she serves aboard the Shenzhou. Fuller had asked for a book to be written based on that premise, and Mack had worked with the Discovery writers to stay \\"in the loop throughout the season with all the scripts and the story development. There were a few false starts, but eventually it allowed us to collaboratively create this story\\". Mack hinted that the USS Enterprise could also appear in the novel. The second Discovery novel is being written by Dayton Ward, is set 10 years before the show, and is intended to be released in early 2018.[113]\\r\\nIn July 2017, IDW announced the first tie-in comic series, also titled Star Trek: Discovery, to be written by Johnson and Beyer with art by Tony Shasteen, who previously worked with Johnson on the comic Star Trek: Boldly Go. IDW described the comic as \\"Klingon-centric\\", and set the first issue for release on October 25.[114] Johnson compared working with Beyer on the comic to his work on the Star Trek: Countdown comic, a tie-in to the 2009 Star Trek film that he wrote with Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, saying that her position as a staff writer on the Discovery show \\"means we have all the inside access that we need. So the story in the comic will really matter and not just feel like a one-off. It is actually able to expand the story you guys are going to see in the show itself.\\"[115]\\r\\nIn August, it was clarified that the first comic would be a four-issue miniseries focused on T'Kuvma and his followers, and that IDW intended to create a series of comic miniseries based on different aspects of the series to create \\"targeted stories on some different subjects\\". Johnson stated that they were \\"building out the characters in the Klingon world with these comics, and we can't wait to show you.\\" He added that discussions were being held regarding the subject of the next miniseries. IDW editor Sarah Gaydos said, \\"The access we're getting to the show to create these comics that are integral to fleshing out the backstories of the characters is unheard of, and I do a lot of licensed comics.\\"[113]\\r\\nIn late 2017, \\"hours\\" of Discovery-based content will be added to the role playing video game Star Trek Timelines, including Michael Burnham and Saru as new crew members for the game and new ships from the show, both Federation and otherwise. A month long \\"Mega-Event\\" based on the series will also take place.[116]","input":"What's the timeline of star trek discovery?"},{"output":"Florence L. Crawford","context":"The Apostolic Faith Church, formerly the Apostolic Faith Mission, is a Pentecostal Christian denomination, with headquarters in Portland, Oregon, United States. The Apostolic Faith Mission of Portland was founded in 1906 by Florence L. Crawford,[1] who was affiliated at that time with William J. Seymour and the Azusa Street Revival of Los Angeles, California. By 1908 Crawford had founded what would become the Apostolic Faith Church. Since July 2000, the President and Superintendent General of the Apostolic Faith Church has been Darrel D. Lee, who also pastors the headquarters church.\\r\\nThe Apostolic Faith Church has a presence in the United States, Canada, Africa, Asia, Europe, Central and South America, and Australia.[2] In 1997, the AFC had 2,013 members in 115 local churches served by 188 clergy in the United States.[3] There are ten churches in Canada, several hundred in Africa (six-hundred in Nigeria alone), twenty throughout the Philippines and Korea, nine in Europe (centrally Romania and Norway), and over sixty in West Indies.[2] Church-affiliated groups also regularly assemble in other parts of the world and recently include India. In some locations, member churches carry instead the name Trinity Apostolic Faith Church in order to differentiate themselves from non-affiliated churches in the same area.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founder of the Apostolic Faith Church was Florence L. Crawford. Crawford was a participant in the Azusa Street Revival. This revival began in 1906 at the Apostolic Faith Mission in Los Angeles. The Azusa Street Mission, as it was called, quickly became the center of the Apostolic Faith movement mainly through the publication of The Apostolic Faith newspaper. Seymour appointed Crawford as the state director of the Pacific Coast Apostolic Faith movement where she would help other missions and churches join the movement. Crawford's break with Seymour was complete by 1911. She began an independent work in Portland, Oregon, with the same name as Seymour's mission and most of the churches under her supervision followed her.[4]\\r\\nThis considerably weakened Seymour's undisputed leadership of the Apostolic Faith movement as most of the churches which had fed the movement chose alignment with Crawford. According to Crawford, the separation was necessitated by rumors that Seymour had abandoned the Wesleyan position that entire sanctification was a second work of grace after conversion. Crawford's mission gained further influence when Clara Lum, editor of The Apostolic Faith, transferred the paper, under controversial circumstances, to the Portland mission in mid-1908.[4] The Apostolic Faith would become the Higher Way at a later date and is still published.[5]\\r\\nThrough the years, the Apostolic Faith Church's leaders have maintained the doctrines outlined in Seymour's editions of the Apostolic Faith papers printed in 1906 through 1908. As a Trinitarian and fundamental church, their doctrinal position centers on a born-again experience, supports the Wesleyan teaching of holiness (Christian perfection), and stresses the need of sanctified believers to receive the Pentecostal experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Their teachings are in direct conflict with Calvinistic beliefs regarding sin, predestination, and eternal security.\\r\\nThe doctrinal statement of the Apostolic Faith Church can be found on the headquarters' website.[6] The text of the page is reprinted below:\\r\\nThe denomination differentiates itself from other Pentecostals by teaching that Speaking in Tongues is only acceptable in known languages and there must be someone there who can interpret.\\r\\nMembership is not by formally joining the church but when you are Saved you are considered a member.\\r\\nWhile they are pacifist members can do things that are not non-violent they served in hospitals and other such services.\\r\\nThey are one of the early groups that had bus ministries, ministries to ships, nursing homes, street meetings and jail meetings.\\r\\nLiterature is printed in many languages and is free. All literature is prayed over and can be used for healing and answers to prayers.\\r\\nServices are composed of the music and they have an orchestra and choir. At the end was an altar call, with the altar being a bench on either side of the front of the church.\\r\\nMinisters are not formally trained but were chosen by elders who laid hands on the person after it was believed they were called.\\r\\nCamp meetings in Portland are two weeks, but used to be longer.\\r\\nMembers are expected to pay ten per cent of their income which is put in a box instead of passing a plate or bag. Expenses for the local church are paid out of this and ten per cent is sent to Portland which also used that to run the headquarters. There were never any sales of cakes, dinners or other fund raisers.\\r\\nAmong the missionary trips was a trip by boat every year to Alaska.","input":"Who is the founder of the apostolic faith?"},{"output":"the radius (or, depending on usage, diameter) of the smallest circular turn (i.e. U-turn) that the vehicle is capable of making","context":"The turning radius or turning circle of a vehicle is the radius (or, depending on usage, diameter) of the smallest circular turn (i.e. U-turn) that the vehicle is capable of making. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe term turning radius is a technical term that has become popular automotive jargon. In the jargon sense, it is commonly used to mean the full diameter of the smallest circle, but in technical usage the turning radius is still used to denote the radius. The less ambiguous term turning circle avoids the mistaken jargon use of the word 'radius' . As an example, Motor Trend refers to a curb-to-curb turning circle of a 2008 Cadillac CTS as 35.5 feet (10.82?m), but the terminology is not yet settled. AutoChannel.com refers to the turning radius of the same car as 35.5 feet (10.82?m). It is often used as a generalized term rather than a numerical figure. For example, a vehicle with a very small turning circle may be described as having a \\"tight turning radius\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo different measurements can be quoted for a vehicle. A curb or curb-to-curb turning circle will show the straight-line distance from one side of the circle to the other, through the center.  The name \\"curb-to-curb\\" indicates that a street would have to be this wide before this car can make a u-turn and not hit a street curb with a wheel. If you took the street curb and built it higher, as high as the car, and tried to make a u-turn in the street, parts of the car (bumper) would hit the wall. The name wall or wall-to-wall turning circle denotes how far apart the two walls would have to be to allow a u-turn without scraping the walls.  One can find these two ways of measuring the turning circle used in auto specifications, for example, a van might be listed as having a turning circle (in meters) of 12.1(C)/12.4(W).\\r\\n\\r\\nA notable exception in this description is of vehicles that are capable of spinning around their central axis, such as certain lawnmowers and wheelchairs as they do not follow a circular path as they turn. In this case the vehicle is referred to as a \\"zero turning radius\\" vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome camera dollies used in the film industry have a \\"round\\" mode which allows them to spin around their z axis by allowing synchronized inverse rotation of their front and rear wheel sets, effectively giving them \\"zero\\" turning radius.","input":"What is the turning radius of a truck?"},{"output":"Coconut water","context":"Coconut water is the clear liquid inside coconuts (which are fruits of the coconut palm).

Further, marketing claims attributing health benefits to coconut water are not based on science and are disallowed by certain regulatory agencies.[2] In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration warned producers about misleading marketing claims that coconut water is antiviral, can lower cholesterol, or can regulate blood glucose levels, among other false claims, as inappropriate for the product.[3]\\r\\nSome companies have faced class action lawsuits over false advertising claims that the product was, \\"super-hydrating\\", \\"nutrient-packed\\", and \\"mega-electrolyte\\".[4] The plaintiffs also alleged that one company, Vita Coco, falsely claimed that its product had \\"15 times the electrolytes found in sports drinks\\" and misrepresented the levels of sodium and magnesium as advertised. The company denied any wrongdoing and settled the lawsuit for US$10 million in April 2012.[4]\\r\\nCoconut water has been used rarely as an intravenous rehydration fluid when medical saline was unavailable.[5] The story of coconut water being similar to human blood plasma originated during World War II when British and Japanese patients were given coconut water intravenously in an emergency because saline was unavailable.[6] Since then, this rehydration technique has been used only for short-term emergency situations in remote locations where plasma is not available.[5]\\r\\nAlthough substituting coconut water for saline is not recommended by physicians today, it was a common practice during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979.[7][8] The Documentation Center of Cambodia cited the practice of allowing untrained nurses to administer green coconut water during the Pol Pot regime as a crime against humanity.[9]\\r\\nCoconut water has been used in the folk medicine practices of Jamaica for such uses as the treatment of diarrhea.[10]\\r\\nOne presumed factor arising from excessive consumption of coconut water is an over-abundance of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia), inducing acute kidney failure, heart arrhythmia, loss of consciousness and eventually death.[11][12] Hyperkalemia and loss of consciousness after the consumption of several liters of coconut water were reported only as a clinical case study in association with one individual's use of a commercial product following physical exertion.[12]\\r\\nAnecdotal sources describe coconut water is used in India for the senicide of elderly people, a procedure known as thalaikoothal.[13] In this custom, the elderly person is made to drink an excessive amount of coconut water, eventually resulting in fever and death, the exact causes of which have not been determined.[13]\\r\\n Media related to Coconut water at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the liquid in a coconut called?"},{"output":"April 21, 1836","context":"Decisive Texian victory;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of San Jacinto, fought on April 21, 1836, in present-day Harris County, Texas, was the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution.  Led by General Sam Houston, the Texian Army engaged and defeated General Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna's Mexican army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes. A detailed, first-hand account of the battle was written by General Houston from Headquarters of the Texian Army, San Jacinto on April 25, 1836.[3] Numerous secondary analyses and interpretations have followed, several of which are cited and discussed throughout this entry. \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Santa Anna, the President of Mexico, and General Martn Perfecto de Cos both escaped during the battle. Santa Anna was captured the next day on April 22 and Cos on April 24, 1836. After being held about three weeks as a prisoner of war, Santa Anna signed the peace treaty that dictated that the Mexican army leave the region, paving the way for the Republic of Texas to become an independent country. These treaties did not specifically recognize Texas as a sovereign nation, but stipulated that Santa Anna was to lobby for such recognition in Mexico City.  Sam Houston became a national celebrity, and the Texans' rallying cries from events of the war, \\"Remember the Alamo!\\" and \\"Remember Goliad!,\\" became etched into Texan history and legend.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna was a proponent of governmental federalism when he helped oust Mexican president Anastasio Bustamante in December 1832.  Upon his election as president in April 1833,[4] Santa Anna switched his political ideology and began implementing centralist policies that increased the authoritarian powers of his office.[5] His abrogation of the Constitution of 1824, correlating with his abolishing local-level authority over Mexico's state of Coahuila y Tejas (Coahuila and Texas), became a flashpoint in the growing tensions between the central government and its Tejano and Anglo citizens in Texas. While in Mexico City awaiting a meeting with Santa Anna, Texian empresario Stephen F. Austin wrote to the Bxar ayuntamiento (city council) urging a break-away state. In response, the Mexican government kept him imprisoned for most of 1834.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Juan Almonte was appointed Director of Colonization in Texas,[8] ostensibly to ease relations with the colonists and mitigate their anxieties about Austin's imprisonment.[9] He delivered promises of self-governance, and conveyed regrets that the Mexican congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state. Behind the rhetoric, his covert mission was to identify the local power brokers, obstruct any plans for rebellion, and supply the Mexican government with data that would be of use in a military conflict. For nine months in 1834, under the guise of serving as a government liaison, Almonte traveled through Texas and compiled an all-encompassing intelligence report on the population and its environs, including an assessment of their resources and defense capabilities.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consolidating his power base, Santa Anna installed General Martn Perfecto de Cos as the governing military authority over Texas in 1835.[11][12] Cos established headquarters in San Antonio on October 9, triggering what became known as the Siege of Bxar.[13] After two months of trying to repel the Texian forces, Cos raised a white flag on December 9, and signed surrender terms two days later.[14] The surrender of Cos effectively removed the occupying Mexican army from Texas.  Many believed the war was over, and volunteers began returning home.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn compliance with orders from Santa Anna, Mexico's Minister of War Jos Mara Tornel issued his December 30 \\"Circular No. 5\\", often referred to as the Tornel Decree, aimed at dealing with United States intervention in the uprising in Texas. It declared that foreigners who entered Mexico for the purpose of joining the rebellion were to be treated as \\"pirates\\", to be put to death if captured. In adding \\"since they are not subjects of any nation at war with the republic nor do they militate under any recognized flag,\\" Tornel avoided declaring war on the United States.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mexican Army of Operations numbered 6,019 soldiers[18] and was spread out over 300 miles (480?km) on its march to Bxar. General Joaqun Ramrez y Sesma was put in command of the Vanguard of the Advance that crossed into Texas.[19] Santa Anna and his aide-de-camp Almonte[20] forded the Rio Grande at Guerrero, Coahuila on February 16, 1836,[21] with General Jos de Urrea and 500 more troops following the next day at Matamoros.[22] Bxar was captured on February 23 and when the assault commenced, attempts at negotiation for surrender were initiated from inside the fortress. Travis sent Albert Martin to request a meeting with Almonte, who replied that he did not have the authority to speak for Santa Anna.[23] Bowie dispatched Green B. Jameson with a letter, translated into Spanish by Juan Segun, requesting a meeting with Santa Anna, who immediately refused. Santa Anna did, however, extend an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress. Alamo non-combatant survivor Enrique Esparza said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nCos, in violation of his surrender terms, forded into Texas at Guerrero on February 26 to join with the main army at Bxar.[25] Urrea proceeded to secure the Gulf Coast, and was victorious in two skirmishes with Texian detachments serving under Fannin at Goliad. On February 27 a foraging detachment under Frank W. Johnson at San Patricio was attacked by Urrea. Sixteen were killed, and 21 taken prisoner, but Johnson and 4 others escaped.[26][27] Urrea sent a company to Agua Dulce searching for James Grant and Plcido Benavides who were leading a company of Anglos and Tejanos towards an invasion of Matamoros. The Mexicans set a trap, killing Grant and most of the company. Benavides and 4 others escaped, and 6 were taken prisoner.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1.[30] The following day, Sam Houston's 42nd birthday, the 59 delegates signed the Texas Declaration of Independence, and chose an ad interim government.[30][31] When news of the declaration reached Goliad, Benavides informed Fannin that in spite of his opposition to Santa Anna, he was still loyal to Mexico and did not wish to help Texas break away.  Fannin discharged him from his duties and sent him home.[32] On March 4 Houston's military authority was expanded to include \\"the land forces of the Texian army both Regular, Volunteer, and Militia.\\"[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 5 a.m. on March 6, the Mexican troops launched their final assault on the Alamo. The guns fell silent 90 minutes later; the Alamo had fallen.[34] Survivors Susannah Dickinson, her daughter Angelina, Travis' slave Joe, and Almonte's cook Ben were spared by Santa Anna and sent to Gonzales, where Texian volunteers had been assembling.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same day that Mexican troops departed Bxar, Houston arrived in Gonzales and informed the 374 volunteers (some without weapons) gathered there that Texas was now an independent republic.[36]  Just after 11 p.m. on March 13, Susanna Dickinson and Joe brought news that the Alamo garrison had been defeated and the Mexican army was marching towards Texian settlements.  A hastily convened council of war voted to evacuate the area and retreat.  The evacuation commenced at midnight and happened so quickly that many Texian scouts were unaware the army had moved on.  Everything that could not be carried was burned, and the army's only two cannons were thrown into the Guadalupe River.[37]  When Ramrez y Sesma reached Gonzales the morning of March 14, he found the buildings still smoldering.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost citizens fled on foot, many carrying their small children.  A cavalry company led by Segun and Salvador Flores were assigned as rear guard to evacuate the more isolated ranches and protect the civilians from attacks by Mexican troops or Indians.[39] The further the army retreated, the more civilians joined the flight.[40] For both armies and the civilians, the pace was slow; torrential rains had flooded the rivers and turned the roads into mud pits.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs news of the Alamo's fall spread, volunteer ranks swelled, reaching about 1,400 men on March 19.[41]   Houston learned of Fannin's defeat on March 20 and realized his army was the last hope for an independent Texas.  Concerned that his ill-trained and ill-disciplined force would be good for only one battle, and aware that his men could easily be outflanked by Urrea's forces, Houston continued to avoid engagement, to the immense displeasure of his troops.[42]  By March 28, the Texian army had retreated 120 miles (190?km) across the Navidad and Colorado Rivers.[43]  Many troops deserted; those who remained grumbled that their commander was a coward.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing, roughly 15 miles (24?km) north of San Felipe.[Note 1]  Two companies that refused to retreat further than San Felipe were assigned to guard the crossings on the Brazos River.[44]  For the next two weeks, the Texians rested, recovered from illness, and, for the first time, began practicing military drills.  While there, two cannons, known as the Twin Sisters, arrived from Cincinnati, Ohio.[45]  Interim Secretary of War Thomas Rusk joined the camp, with orders from President David G. Burnet to replace Houston if he refused to fight. Houston quickly persuaded Rusk that his plans were sound.[45] Secretary of State Samuel P. Carson advised Houston to continue retreating all the way to the Sabine River, where more volunteers would likely flock from the United States and allow the army to counterattack.[Note 2][46]  Unhappy with everyone involved, Burnet wrote to Houston: \\"The enemy are laughing you to scorn. You must fight them. You must retreat no further. The country expects you to fight. The salvation of the country depends on your doing so.\\"[45]  Complaints within the camp became so strong that Houston posted notices that anyone attempting to usurp his position would be court-martialed and shot.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Anna and a smaller force had remained in Bxar.  After receiving word that the acting president, Miguel Barragn, had died, Santa Anna seriously considered returning to Mexico City to solidify his position.  Fear that Urrea's victories would position him as a political rival convinced Santa Anna to remain in Texas to personally oversee the final phase of the campaign.[48]  He left on March 29 to join Ramrez y Sesma, leaving only a small force to hold Bxar.[49]  At dawn on April 7, their combined force marched into San Felipe and captured a Texian soldier, who informed Santa Anna that the Texians planned to retreat further if the Mexican army crossed the Brazos River.[50]  Unable to cross the Brazos due to the small company of Texians barricaded at the river crossing, on April 14 a frustrated Santa Anna led a force of about 700 troops to capture the interim Texas government.[51][52]   Government officials fled mere hours before Mexican troops arrived in Harrisburgh (now Harrisburg, Houston) and Santa Anna sent Colonel Juan Almonte with 50 cavalry to intercept them in New Washington.  Almonte arrived just as Burnet shoved off in a rowboat, bound for Galveston Island.  Although the boat was still within range of their weapons, Almonte ordered his men to hold their fire so as not to endanger Burnet's family.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, Santa Anna believed the rebellion was in its final death throes.  The Texian government had been forced off the mainland, with no way to communicate with its army, which had shown no interest in fighting.  He determined to block the Texian army's retreat and put a decisive end to the war.[53]  Almonte's scouts incorrectly reported that Houston's army was going to Lynchburg Crossing, on Buffalo Bayou, in preparation for joining the government in Galveston, so Santa Anna ordered Harrisburg burned and pressed on towards Lynchburg.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Texian army had resumed their march eastward.  On April 16, they came to a crossroads; one road led north towards Nacogdoches, the other went to Harrisburg.  Without orders from Houston and with no discussion amongst themselves, the troops in the lead took the road to Harrisburg.  They arrived on April 18, not long after the Mexican army's departure.[54]  That same day, Deaf Smith and Henry Karnes captured a Mexican courier carrying intelligence on the locations and future plans of all of the Mexican troops in Texas.  Realizing that Santa Anna had only a small force and was not far away, Houston gave a rousing speech to his men, exhorting them to \\"Remember the Alamo\\" and \\"Remember Goliad\\".  His army then raced towards Lynchburg.[55]  Out of concern that his men might not differentiate between Mexican soldiers and the Tejanos in Segun's company, Houston originally ordered Segun and his men to remain in Harrisburg to guard those who were too ill to travel quickly.  After loud protests from Segun and Antonio Menchaca, the order was rescinded, provided the Tejanos wear a piece of cardboard in their hats to identify them as Texian soldiers.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area along Buffalo Bayou had many thick oak groves, separated by marshes. This type of terrain was familiar to the Texians and quite alien to the Mexican soldiers.[57] Houston's army, comprising 900 men, reached Lynch's Ferry mid-morning on April 20; Santa Anna's 700-man force arrived a few hours later. The Texians made camp in a wooded area along the bank of Buffalo Bayou; while the location provided good cover and helped hide their full strength, it also left the Texians no room for retreat.[58][59] Over the protests of several of his officers, Santa Anna chose to make camp in a vulnerable location, a plain near the San Jacinto River, bordered by woods on one side, marsh and lake on another.[57][60] The two camps were approximately 500 yards (460?m) apart, separated by a grassy area with a slight rise in the middle.[61] Colonel Pedro Delgado later wrote that \\"the camping ground of His Excellency's selection was in all respects, against military rules. Any youngster would have done better.\\"[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next several hours, two brief skirmishes occurred. Texians won the first, forcing a small group of dragoons and the Mexican artillery to withdraw.[57][63] Mexican dragoons then forced the Texian cavalry to withdraw. In the melee, Rusk, on foot to reload his rifle, was almost captured by Mexican soldiers, but was rescued by newly arrived Texian volunteer Mirabeau B. Lamar.[63] Over Houston's objections, many infantrymen rushed onto the field. As the Texian cavalry fell back, Lamar remained behind to rescue another Texian who had been thrown from his horse; Mexican officers \\"reportedly applauded\\" his bravery.[64] Houston was irate that the infantry had disobeyed his orders and given Santa Anna a better estimate of their strength; the men were equally upset that Houston had not allowed a full battle.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the night, Mexican troops worked to fortify their camp, creating breastworks out of everything they could find, including saddles and brush.[66] At 9 a.m. on April 21, Cos arrived with 540 reinforcements, bringing the Mexican force to approximately 1200-1500 men which outnumbered the Texian aggregate forces of approximately 800 men (official count entering battle was reported at 783).[67] General Cos' men were mostly raw recruits rather than experienced soldiers, and they had marched steadily for more than 24 hours, with no rest and no food.[68] As the morning wore on with no Texian attack, Mexican officers lowered their guard. By afternoon, Santa Anna had given permission for Cos' men to sleep; his own tired troops also took advantage of the time to rest, eat, and bathe.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long after Cos arrived with reinforcements, General Houston ordered Smith to destroy Vince's Bridge (located about 8 miles from the Texian encampment) to block the only road out of the Brassos and, thereby, prevent any possibility of escape by Santa Anna.[70] General Sam Houston described how he arrayed the Texian forces in preparation of battle: \\"Colonel Edward Burleson was assigned the center. The second regiment, under the command of Colonel Sydney Sherman, formed the left wing of the army. The artillery, under the special command of Col. Geo. W. Hackley, inspector general, was placed on the right of the first regiment, and four companies under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Millard, sustained the artillery on the right, and our cavalry, sixty-one in number and commanded by Colonel Mirabeau B. LaMar...placed on our extreme right, composed our line.\\" [71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Texian cavalry was first dispatched to the Mexican forces' far left and the artillery advanced through the tall grass to within 200 yards of the Mexican breastworks. [72]. The Texian cannon fired at 4:30, beginning the battle of San Jacinto.[73]  After a single volley, Texians broke ranks and swarmed over the Mexican breastworks to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Mexican soldiers were taken by surprise. Santa Anna,  Castrill܇n, and Almonte yelled often conflicting orders, attempting to organize their men into some form of defense.[74] The Texian infantry forces advanced without halt until they had possession of the woodland and the Mexican breastwork; the right wing of Burleson's and the left wing of Millard's forces took possession of the breastwork. [75] Within 18 minutes, Mexican soldiers abandoned their campsite and fled for their lives.[76] The killing lasted for hours.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Mexican soldiers retreated through the marsh to Peggy Lake.[Note 3] Texian riflemen stationed themselves on the banks and shot at anything that moved. Many Texian officers, including Houston and Rusk, attempted to stop the slaughter, but they were unable to gain control of the men. Texians continued to chant \\"Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!\\" while frightened Mexican infantry yelled \\"Me no Alamo!\\" and begged for mercy to no avail.[78]  In what historian Davis called \\"one of the most one-sided victories in history\\",[79] 650 Mexican soldiers were killed and 300 captured.[80] Eleven Texians died, with 30 others, including Houston, wounded.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Santa Anna's troops had been thoroughly vanquished, they did not represent the bulk of the Mexican army in Texas. An additional 4,000 troops remained under the commands of Urrea and General Vicente Filisola.[82] Texians had won the battle due to mistakes made by Santa Anna, and Houston was well aware that his troops would have little hope of repeating their victory against Urrea or Filisola.[83] As darkness fell, a large group of prisoners was led into camp. Houston initially mistook the group for Mexican reinforcements and reportedly shouted out that all was lost.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nSanta Anna had escaped towards Vince's Bridge.[85] Finding the bridge destroyed, he hid in the marsh and was captured the following day.[80] He was brought before Houston, who had been shot in the ankle and badly wounded.[82][Note 4] Texian soldiers gathered around, calling for the Mexican general's immediate execution.  Bargaining for his life, Santa Anna suggested that he order the remaining Mexican troops to stay away.[86] In a letter to Filisola, who was now the senior Mexican official in Texas, Santa Anna wrote that \\"yesterday evening [we] had an unfortunate encounter\\" and ordered his troops to retreat to Bxar and await further instructions.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nUrrea urged Filisola to continue the campaign. He was confident that he could challenge the Texian troops. According to Hardin, \\"Santa Anna had presented Mexico with one military disaster; Filisola did not wish to risk another.\\"[87] Spring rains had ruined the ammunition and rendered the roads nearly impassable, with troops sinking to their knees in mud. The Mexican troops were soon out of food and began to fall ill from dysentery and other diseases.[88] Their supply lines had broken down, leaving no hope of further reinforcements.[89] Filisola later wrote that \\"Had the enemy met us under these cruel circumstances, on the only road that was left, no alternative remained but to die or surrender at discretion\\".[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several weeks after San Jacinto, Santa Anna continued to negotiate with Houston, Rusk, and then Burnet.[90] Santa Anna suggested two treaties, a public version of promises made between the two countries, and a private version that included Santa Anna's personal agreements. The Treaties of Velasco required that all Mexican troops withdraw south of the Rio Grande and that all private property be respected and restored. Prisoners of war would be released unharmed and Santa Anna would be given immediate passage to Veracruz. He secretly promised to persuade the Mexican Congress to acknowledge the Republic of Texas and to recognize the Rio Grande as the border between the two countries.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Urrea began marching south in mid-May, many families from San Patricio who had supported the Mexican army went with him. When Texian troops arrived in early June, they found only 20 families remaining. The area around San Patricio and Refugio suffered a \\"noticeable depopulation\\" in the Republic of Texas years.[92] Although the treaty had specified that Urrea and Filisola would return any slaves their armies had sheltered, Urrea refused to comply. Many former slaves followed the army to Mexico, where they could be free.[93] By late May, the Mexican troops had crossed the Nueces.[88]  Filisola fully expected that the defeat was temporary and that a second campaign would be launched to retake Texas.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mexican authorities received word of Santa Anna's defeat at San Jacinto, flags across the country were lowered to half staff and draped in mourning.[95]  Denouncing any agreements signed by a prisoner, Mexican authorities refused to recognize the Republic of Texas.[96]  Filisola was derided for leading the retreat and quickly replaced by Urrea.  Within months, Urrea gathered 6,000 troops in Matamoros, poised to reconquer Texas.  His army was redirected to address continued federalist rebellions in other regions.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost in Texas assumed the Mexican army would return quickly.[98]  So many American volunteers flocked to the Texian army in the months after the victory at San Jacinto that the Texian government was unable to maintain an accurate list of enlistments.[99]  Out of caution, Bxar remained under martial law throughout 1836.  Rusk ordered that all Tejanos in the area between the Guadalupe and Nueces Rivers  migrate either to east Texas or to Mexico.[98]  Some residents who refused to comply were forcibly removed.  New Anglo settlers moved in and used threats and legal maneuvering to take over the land once owned by Tejanos.[96][100]  Over the next several years, hundreds of Tejano families resettled in Mexico.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor years,  Mexican authorities used the reconquering of Texas as an excuse for implementing new taxes and making the army the budgetary priority of the impoverished nation.[101]  Only sporadic skirmishes resulted.[102]  Larger expeditions were postponed as military funding was consistently diverted to other rebellions, out of fear that those regions would ally with Texas and further fragment the country.[101][Note 5] The northern Mexican states, the focus of the Matamoros Expedition, briefly launched an independent Republic of the Rio Grande in 1839.[103] The same year, the Mexican Congress considered a law to declare it treasonous to speak positively of Texas.[104]  In June 1843, leaders of the two nations declared an armistice.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 1, Santa Anna boarded a ship to travel back to Mexico.  For the next two days, crowds of soldiers, many of whom had arrived that week from the United States, gathered to demand his execution.  Lamar, by now promoted to Secretary of War, gave a speech insisting that \\"Mobs must not intimidate the government. We want no French Revolution in Texas!\\", but on June 4 soldiers seized Santa Anna and put him under military arrest.[106]  Burnet called for elections to ratify the constitution and elect a Congress,[107] the sixth set of leaders for Texas in a twelve-month period.[108]  Voters overwhelmingly chose Houston the first president, ratified the constitution drawn up by the Convention of 1836, and approved a resolution to request annexation to the United States.[109]  Houston issued an executive order sending Santa Anna to Washington, D.C., and from there he was soon sent home.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring his absence, Santa Anna had been deposed.  Upon his arrival, the Mexican press wasted no time in attacking him for his cruelty towards those executed at Goliad.  In May 1837, Santa Anna requested an inquiry into the event.[111]  The judge determined the inquiry was only for fact-finding and took no action; press attacks in both Mexico and the United States continued.[112]  Santa Anna was disgraced until the following year, when he became a hero of the Pastry War.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Texian interim governments had vowed to eventually compensate citizens for goods that were impressed during the war efforts, for the most part livestock and horses were not returned.[114]  Veterans were guaranteed land bounties; in 1879, surviving Texian veterans who served more than three months from October 1, 1835, through January 1, 1837, were guaranteed an additional 1,280 acres (520?ha) in public lands.[115]  Over 1.3 million acres (559 thousand ha) of land were granted; some of this was in Greer County, which was later determined to be part of Oklahoma.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Republic President Burnet unknowingly escaped death at New Washington, Almonte had found him by following courier Mike McCormick,[117] whose widowed mother Peggy was the owner of the land on which the battle was subsequently fought.[59] Although she sought financial restitution from the Republic of Texas for loss of livestock and other goods during the battle, McCormick died without recompense. Decades after her death, the state of Texas purchased part of her acreage for a commemoration site.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.[119] The site includes the 570?ft (170?m)[120] San Jacinto Monument, which was erected by the Public Works Administration. Authorized April 21, 1936, and dedicated April 21, 1939, the monument cost $1.5 million (equivalent to $26.39 million in 2015).[121][122] The site hosts a San Jacinto Day festival and battle re-enactment each year in April.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the Texas Navy and the United States Navy have commissioned ships named after the Battle of San Jacinto: the Texan schooner San Jacinto and three ships named USS?San Jacinto. There has been one civilian passenger ship named SS San Jacinto.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the veteran battleship USS Texas was decommissioned in 1948 and made into a museum ship, it was decided to give her a permanent new anchorage near the San Jacinto Monument, at San Jacinto State Park. Her arrival from Baltimore, where she was decommissioned, was timed for April 21, 1948 ÿ the anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto.","input":"When did the battle of san jacinto happen?"},{"output":"43,752","context":"Co-op City (short for Cooperative City), located in the Baychester section of the borough of the Bronx in northeast New York City, is the largest cooperative housing development in the world.[5] Situated at the intersection of Interstate 95 and the Hutchinson River Parkway, the community is part of Bronx Community District 10.

The building foundations extend down to bedrock through 50,000 pilings,[13] but the land surrounding Co-op's structures settles and sinks a fraction of an inch each year, creating cracks in sidewalks and entrances to buildings.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-op City is on the site of Freedomland, a former amusement park which closed in 1964.[15] Prior to housing that theme park, the land north of the Hutchinson River Parkway was a large area known by residents as \\"the dump\\". By the '50s, most of the land on the north side of the Hutchinson River was flat land used for recreation; for example, model airplane flying meets were held there. It was possible to drive up to the Hutchinson River and walk along several paths through the reeds and swim in the Hutchinson River. The land to the south of the Hutchinson River (Section 5 of Co-op City) was unspoiled swamp land from the '50s up through the time Co-op City was constructed. A tidal estuary reached from the Hutchinson River at the New Haven Railroad along a route just north of Hunter and Boller Avenue to pass under the Hutchinson River Parkway. The estuary was the site of boat yards and canoe rental sites during the 1950s. A well-known restaurant at that site was Gus's Barge, operated by Gus and Francis Erickson. Gus's Barge was a restaurant and a night club featuring jazz combos and other forms of live music. The Ericksons also operated a boat yard that not only rented slips but specialized in refurbishing wooden boats, primarily motor boats made from teak and mahogany. The Ericksons sold their property in 1961ÿ62.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project was sponsored and built by the United Housing Foundation, an organization established in 1951 by Abraham Kazan and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. It was designed by cooperative architect Herman J. Jessor. The name of the complex's corporation itself was later changed to RiverBay at Co-op City.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe construction of the community was financed with a mortgage loan from New York State's Housing Finance Agency (HFA). The complex defaulted on the loan in 1975 and has had ongoing agreements to pay back HFA, until 2004 when it was financially unable to continue payments due to the huge costs of emergency repairs. New York Community Bank helped RiverBay satisfy its $57 million mortgage obligation, except for $95 million in arrears, by refinancing the loan later that same year. This led to the agreement that Co-op City would remain in the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program for at least seven more years as a concession on the arrears and that any rehabilitation that Co-op City took on to improve the original poor construction (which happened under the State's watch) would earn credit toward eliminating the debt. By 2008, RiverBay had submitted enough proof of construction repairs to pay off the balance of arrears to New York State.\\r\\n\\r\\nMismanagement, shoddy construction and corruption led to the community defaulting on its loan in 1975. The original Kazan board resigned and the state took over control. Cooperators were faced with a 25 percent increase in their monthly maintenance fees. Instead, a rent-strike was organized. New York State threatened to foreclose on the property, and evict the tenants  which would mean the loss of their equity. But Cooperators stayed united and held out for 13 months (the longest and largest rent-strike in United States history) before a compromise was finally reached, with mediation from then Bronx Borough President, Robert Abrams, and then Secretary of State, Mario Cuomo. Cooperators would remit $20 million in back pay, but they would get to take over management of the complex and set their own fees.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shares of stock that prospective purchasers bought to enable them to occupy Co-op City apartments became the subject of protracted litigation culminating in a United States Supreme Court decision United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837 (1975).\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the first decade of the 2000s, the aging development began undergoing a complex-wide $240 million renovation, replacing piping and garbage compactors, rehabilitating garages and roofs, upgrading the power plant, making facade and terrace repairs, switching to energy-efficient lighting and water-conserving technologies, replacing all 130,000 windows and 4,000 terrace doors (costing $57.9 million in material and labor) and all 179 elevators. The word \\"renaissance\\" is being used to describe this period in Co-op City history. Many of these efforts are also helping in the \\"greening\\" of the complex: the power-plant will be less polluting, the buildings will be more efficient and recycling efforts will become more extensive. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) awarded its largest ever grant$5.2 millionto the community under its NY Energy $mart Assisted Multifamily Program.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, after a partial collapse in one garage, inspectors found 5 of the 8 garages to be unsafe and ordered them closed for extensive repairs. The other 3 garages were able to remain partially open during repairs. To deal with the parking crisis, New York City allowed angled parking in the community, the large greenways in the complex were paved over to make outdoor parking lots and agreements were made with nearby shopping centers to use their extra parking spaces. January 2008 was the first time in over 4?1?2 years that all the garages were back open. The greenways are in the process of being restored.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial responsibility for these upgrades was the subject of a protracted dispute between RiverBay and the State of New York.[17] Co-op City was developed under New York's Mitchell-Lama Program, which subsidizes affordable housing. RiverBay charged that the state should help with the costs because of severe infrastructure failures stemming from the development's original shoddy construction, which occurred under the supervision of the state. The state countered that RiverBay was responsible for the costs because of its lack of maintenance over the years. In the end, a compromise had the state supplying money and RiverBay refinancing the mortgage, borrowing $480 million from New York Community Bank in 2004, to cover the rest of the capital costs.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the power plant was in the process of upgrading from solely managing the electricity brought in from Con Edison to a 40-megawatt tri-generation facility with the ability to use oil, gas or steam (depending on market conditions) to power turbines to produce its own energy. The final cost of this energy independence could be as much as $90 million, but it is hoped to pay for itself with the savings earnedwith conservative estimates at $18 million annuallywithin several years. Also, whatever excess power generated after satisfying the community's needs will be sold back to the electrical grid, adding another source of income for RiverBay.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2007, a report by the New York Inspector General, Kristine Hamann, charged that the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), which is responsible for overseeing Mitchel-Lama developments, was negligent in its duties to supervise the contracting, financial reporting, budgeting and the enforcement of regulations in Co-op City (and other M-L participants) during the period of January 2003 to October 2006. The report also chided Marion Scott management for trying to influence the RiverBay Board by financing election candidates and providing jobs and sports tickets to Board members and their family/friendsall violations of DHCR and/or RiverBay regulations. The DHCR was instructed to overhaul its system of oversight to better protect the residents and taxpayer money.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2007, a former board president, Iris Herskowitz Baez, and a former painting contractor, Nickhoulas Vitale, pleaded guilty to involvement in a kickback scheme. While on the RiverBay Board, Baez steered $3.5 million in subsidized painting contracts for needed work in Co-op City apartments, to Vitale's company, Stadium Interior Painting, in exchange for $100,000 in taxpayer money.[20] Ms. Herskowitz Baez was sentenced to 6 months in jail, 12 months probation and given a $10,000 fine in March 2008.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiverBay Corporation is the corporation that operates the community and is led by a 15-member board of directors. As a cooperative development, the tenants run the complex through this elected board. There is no pay for serving on the board. The corporation employs over 1000 people and has 32 administrative and operational departments to serve the development.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe complex has its own Public Safety Department with more than 100 sworn officers, which include field patrol, plainclothes detectives and EMT/AED certified members of the force. All members have also attained peace officer status by NY State because of their special training. In December 2007, the cable television company Cablevision gave RiverBay permission to use its fiber optic cables in order to install additional surveillance cameras throughout the complex to be viewed at the Public Safety Command Center. In 2008, trained supervisors were granted the power to write summonses for parking and noise violations and Segways were acquiredÿalong with bikesÿto help the officers patrol during the warmer months.\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-op City was managed by Marion Scott Real Estate, Inc. from October 1999 to November 2014. Before then the property was run by in-house general managers. The development is currently managed by Douglas Elliman Property Management.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two weekly newspapers serving the community: Co-op City Times (the official RiverBay paper) and City News.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of January 2010, those who wish to move into Co-op City must meet the following requirements:\\r\\n\\r\\nSales prices:\\r\\n\\r\\nIncome requirement:\\r\\n\\r\\nMonthly maintenance:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Co-op City Department of Public Safety, a private public safety force, enforces state and city laws on Co-op City property in order to protect them. The Co-op City Department of Public Safety currently employs more than 100 Public Safety officers and 10 civilian employees.[23][24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Co-Op City was 43,752, an increase of 3,076 (7.6%) from the 40,676 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 857.55 acres (347.04?ha), the neighborhood had a population density of 51.0 inhabitants per acre (32,600/sq?mi; 12,600/km2).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe racial makeup of the neighborhood was 8.5% (3,723) White, 60.5% (26,452) African American, 0.2% (108) Native American, 1.2% (522) Asian, 0.0% (7) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (125) from other races, and 1.6% (681) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 27.7% (12,134) of the population.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of its large senior citizen blockwell over 8,300 residents above the age of sixty as of 2007[26]it is considered the largest naturally occurring retirement community (NORC) in the nation and its Senior Services Program has extensive outreach to help its aging residents, most of whom moved in as workers and remained after retiring.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-op City was home to a large Jewish community during its early years, as well as Italian Americans and Irish Americans; many of them had relocated from other areas of the Bronx, such as the Grand Concourse. With African Americans making up a large minority, the community became known for its ethnic diversity. As early tenants grew older and moved away, the newer residents reflected the current population of the Bronx, with African American and Hispanic residents comprising the majority of residents by 1987.[28] In the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the neighborhood received an influx of former Eastern Bloc migrs, especially from Russia and Albania.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-op City is served by New York City Bus routes Bx5, Bx12, Bx26, Bx28, Bx29, Bx30, and MTA Bus routes Bx23, Q50, BxM7.[30] These local city buses, with the exception of the BxM7, which is an express bus to Manhattan, connect Co-op City with subway services. While there are no subway or Metro-North commuter rail stations in Co-op City (a plan to extend the IRT Pelham Line to Co-op City as part of the 1968 Program for Action ran out of money[31][32]), the MTA is planning to extend Metro-North service to Penn Station, and included in that plan is a station at Co-op City, an idea that has been proposed since the 1970s.[33]","input":"What is the population of co op city?"},{"output":"an alternative model of the universe","context":"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) is the seminal work on the heliocentric theory of the Renaissance astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473ÿ1543). The book, first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg, Holy Roman Empire, offered an alternative model of the universe to Ptolemy's geocentric system, which had been widely accepted since ancient times.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCopernicus initially outlined his system in a short, untitled, anonymous manuscript that he distributed to several friends, referred to as the Commentariolus. A physician's library list dating to 1514 includes a manuscript whose description matches the Commentariolus, so Copernicus must have begun work on his new system by that time.[1] Most historians believe that he wrote the Commentariolus after his return from Italy, possibly only after 1510. At this time, Copernicus anticipated that he could reconcile the motion of the Earth with the perceived motions of the planets easily, with fewer motions than were necessary in the Alfonsine Tables, the version of the Ptolemaic system current at the time.[citation needed] In particular, the heliocentric Copernican model made use of the Urdi Lemma developed in the 13th century by Mu'ayyad al-Din al-'Urdi, the first of the Maragha astronomers to develop a non-Ptolemaic model of planetary motion.[2]\\r\\nObservations of Mercury by Bernhard Walther (1430ÿ1504) of Nuremberg, a pupil of Regiomontanus, were made available to Copernicus by Johannes Sch?ner, 45 observations in total, 14 of them with longitude and latitude. Copernicus used three of them in De revolutionibus, giving only longitudes, and erroneously attributing them to Sch?ner.[citation needed] Copernicus' values differed slightly from the ones published by Sch?ner in 1544 in Observationes XXX annorum a I. Regiomontano et B. Walthero Norimbergae habitae, [4, Norimb. 1544].\\r\\nA manuscript of De revolutionibus in Copernicus' own hand has survived. After his death, it was given to his pupil, Rheticus, who for publication had only been given a copy without annotations. Via Heidelberg, it ended up in Prague, where it was rediscovered and studied in the 19th century. Close examination of the manuscript, including the different types of paper used, helped scholars construct an approximate timetable for its composition. Apparently Copernicus began by making a few astronomical observations to provide new data to perfect his models.[citation needed] He may have begun writing the book while still engaged in observations. By the 1530s a substantial part of the book was complete, but Copernicus hesitated to publish.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1539 Georg Joachim Rheticus, a young mathematician from Wittenberg, arrived in Frauenburg (Frombork) to study with him. Rheticus read Copernicus' manuscript and immediately wrote a non-technical summary of its main theories in the form of an open letter addressed to Sch?ner, his astrology teacher in Nrnberg; he published this letter as the Narratio Prima in Danzig in 1540. Rheticus' friend and mentor Achilles Gasser published a second edition of the Narratio in Basel in 1541. Due to its friendly reception, Copernicus finally agreed to publication of more of his main workin 1542, a treatise on trigonometry, which was taken from the second book of the still unpublished De revolutionibus. Rheticus published it in Copernicus' name.\\r\\nUnder strong pressure from Rheticus, and having seen that the first general reception of his work had not been unfavorable, Copernicus finally agreed to give the book to his close friend, Bishop Tiedemann Giese, to be delivered to Rheticus in Wittenberg for printing by Johannes Petreius at Nrnberg (Nuremberg). It was published just before Copernicus' death, in 1543.\\r\\nThe book is dedicated to Pope Paul III in a preface that argues that mathematics, not physics, should be the basis for understanding and accepting his new theory.\\r\\nDe revolutionibus is divided into six \\"books\\" (sections or parts), following closely the layout of Ptolemy's Almagest which it updated and replaced:[3]\\r\\nCopernicus argued that the universe comprised eight spheres. The outermost consisted of motionless, fixed stars, with the Sun motionless at the center. The known planets revolved about the Sun, each in its own sphere, in the order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. The Moon, however, revolved in its sphere around the Earth. What appeared to be the daily revolution of the Sun and fixed stars around the Earth was actually the Earth's daily rotation on its own axis.\\r\\nCopernicus adhered to one of the standard beliefs of his time, namely that the motions of celestial bodies must be composed of uniform circular motions. For this reason, he was unable to account for the observed apparent motion of the planets without retaining a complex system of epicycles similar to those of the Ptolemaic system. Despite Copernicus' adherence to this aspect of ancient astronomy, his radical shift from a geocentric to a heliocentric cosmology was a serious blow to Aristotle's scienceand helped usher in the Scientific Revolution.\\r\\nRheticus left Nrnberg to take up his post as professor in Leipzig. The Lutheran preacher Andreas Osiander had taken over the task of supervising the printing and publication. In an effort to reduce the controversial impact of the book Osiander added his own unsigned letter Ad lectorem de hypothesibus huius operis (To the reader concerning the hypotheses of this work)[4] printed in front of Copernicus' preface which was a dedicatory letter to Pope Paul III and which kept the title \\"Praefatio authoris\\" (to acknowledge that the unsigned letter was not by the book's author).\\r\\nOsiander's letter stated that Copernicus' system was mathematics intended to aid computation and not an attempt to declare literal truth:\\r\\nit is the duty of an astronomer to compose the history of the celestial motions through careful and expert study. Then he must conceive and devise the causes of these motions or hypotheses about them. Since he cannot in any way attain to the true causes, he will adopt whatever suppositions enable the motions to be computed correctly?... The present author has performed both these duties excellently. For these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable. On the contrary, if they provide a calculus consistent with the observations, that alone is enough?... For this art, it is quite clear, is completely and absolutely ignorant of the causes of the apparent [movement of the heavens]. And if any causes are devised by the imagination, as indeed very many are, they are not put forward to convince anyone that they are true, but merely to provide a reliable basis for computation. However, since different hypotheses are sometimes offered for one and the same?... the astronomer will take as his first choice that hypothesis which is the easiest to grasp. The philosopher will perhaps rather seek the semblance of the truth. But neither of them will understand or state anything certain, unless it has been divinely revealed to him?... Let no one expect anything certain from astronomy, which cannot furnish it, lest he accept as the truth ideas conceived for another purpose, and depart this study a greater fool than when he entered.[5]\\r\\nAs even Osiander's defenders point out, the Ad lectorem \\"expresses views on the aim and nature of scientific theories at variance with Copernicus' claims for his own theory\\".[6]\\r\\nMany view Osiander's letter as a betrayal of science and Copernicus, and an attempt to pass his own thoughts off as those of the book's author. An example of this type of claim can be seen in the Catholic Encyclopedia, which states \\"Fortunately for him [the dying Copernicus], he could not see what Osiander had done. This reformer, knowing the attitude of Luther and Melanchthon against the heliocentric system?... without adding his own name, replaced the preface of Copernicus by another strongly contrasting in spirit with that of Copernicus.\\"[7]\\r\\nWhile Osiander's motives behind the letter have been questioned by many, he has been defended by historian Bruce Wrightsman, who points out he was not an enemy of science. Osiander had many scientific connections including \\"Johannes Schoner, Rheticus's teacher, whom Osiander recommended for his post at the Nurnberg Gymnasium; Peter Apian of Ingolstadt University; Hieronymous Schreiber...Joachim Camerarius...Erasmus Reinhold...Joachim Rheticus...and finally, Hieronymous Cardan.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe historian Wrightsman put forward that Osiander did not sign the letter because he \\"was such a notorious [Protestant] reformer whose name was well-known and infamous among Catholics\\",[6] so that signing would have likely caused negative scrutiny of the work of Copernicus (a loyal Catholic canon and scholar). Copernicus himself had communicated to Osiander his \\"own fears that his work would be scrutinized and criticized by the 'peripatetics and theologians',\\"[6] and he had already been in trouble with his bishop, Johannes Dantiscus, on account of his former relationship with his mistress and friendship with Dantiscus's enemy and suspected heretic, Alexander Scultetus. It was also possible that Protestant Nurnberg could fall to the forces of the Holy Roman Emperor and since \\"the books of hostile theologians could be burned...why not scientific works with the names of hated theologians affixed to them?[6]\\" Wrightsman also holds that this is why Copernicus did not mention his top student, Rheticus (a Lutheran) in the book's dedication to the Pope.[6]\\r\\nOsiander's interest in astronomy was theological, hoping for \\"improving the chronology of historical events and thus providing more accurate apocalyptic interpretations of the Bible... [he shared in] the general awareness that the calendar was not in agreement with astronomical movement and therefore, needed to be corrected by devising better models on which to base calculations.\\" In an era before the telescope, Osiander (like most of the era's mathematical astronomers) attempted to bridge the \\"fundamental incompatibility between Ptolemaic astronomy and Aristotlian physics, and the need to preserve both\\", by taking an 'instrumentalist' position. Only the handful of \\"Philosophical purists like the Averroists... demanded physical consistency and thus sought for realist models.\\"[6]\\r\\nCopernicus was hampered by his insistence on preserving the idea that celestial bodies had to travel in perfect spheres ÿ he \\"was still attached to classical ideas of circular motion around deferents and epicycles, and spheres.\\"[8] This was particularly troubling concerning the Earth because he \\"attached the Earth's axis rigidly to a Sun-centered sphere. The unfortunate consequence was that the terrestrial rotation axis then maintained the same inclination with respect to the Sun as the sphere turned, eliminating the seasons.\\"[8] To explain the seasons, he had to propose a third motion, \\"an annual contrary conical sweep of the terrestrial axis\\".[8] It was not until the Great Comet of 1577, which moved as if there were no spheres to crash through, did the idea come under question. In 1609, Kepler fixed Copernicus' theory by stating that the planets orbit the sun not in circles, but ellipses. Only after Kepler's refinement of Copernicus' theory was the need for deferents and epicycles abolished.\\r\\nIn his work, Copernicus \\"used conventional, hypothetical devices like epicycles...as all astronomers had done since antiquity. ...hypothetical constructs solely designed to 'save the phenomena' and aid computation\\".[6] Ptolemy's theory contained a hypothesis about the epicycle of Venus that was viewed as absurd if seen as anything other than a geometrical device (its brightness and distance should have varied greatly, but they don't). \\"In spite of this defect in Ptolemy's theory, Copernicus' hypothesis predicts approximately the same variations.\\"[6] Because of the use of similar terms and similar deficiencies, Osiander could see \\"little technical or physical truth-gain\\"[6] between one system and the other. It was this attitude towards technical astronomy that had allowed it to \\"function since antiquity, despite its inconsistencies with the principles of physics and the philosophical objections of Averroists.\\"[6]\\r\\nWriting Ad lectorem, Osiander was influenced by Pico della Mirandola's idea that humanity \\"orders [an intellectual] cosmos out of the chaos of opinions.\\"[6] From Pico's writings, Osiander \\"learned to extract and synthesize insights from many sources without becoming the slavish follower of any of them.\\"[6] The effect of Pico on Osiander was tempered by the influence of Nicholas of Cusa's and his idea of coincidentia oppositorum. Rather than having Pico's focus on human effort, Osiander followed Cusa's idea that understanding the Universe and its Creator only came from divine inspiration rather than intellectual organization. From these influences, Osiander held that in the area of philosophical speculation and scientific hypothesis there are \\"no heretics of the intellect\\", but when one gets past speculation into truth-claims the Bible is the ultimate measure. By holding Copernicianism was mathematical speculation, Osiander held that it would be silly to hold it up against the accounts of the Bible.\\r\\nPico's influence on Osiander did not escape Rheticus, who reacted strongly against the Ad lectorem. As historian Robert S. Westman puts it, \\"The more profound source of Rheticus's ire however, was Osiander's view of astronomy as a disciple fundamentally incapable of knowing anything with certainty. For Rheticus, this extreme position surely must have resonated uncomfortably with Pico della Mirandola's attack on the foundations of divinatory astrology.\\"[9]\\r\\nIn his Disputations, Pico had made a devastating attack on astrology. Because those who were making astrological predictions relied on astronomers to tell them where the planets were, they also became a target. Pico held that since astronomers who calculate planetary positions could not agree among themselves, how were they to be held as reliable? While Pico could bring into concordance writers like Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, Averroes, Avicenna, and Aquinas, the lack of consensus he saw in astronomy was a proof to him of its fallibility alongside astrology. Pico pointed out that the astronomers' instruments were imprecise and any imperfection of even a degree made them worthless for astrology, people should not trust astrologists because they should not trust the numbers from astronomers. Pico pointed out that astronomers couldn't even tell where the sun appeared in the order of the planets as they orbited the earth (some put it close to the moon, others among the planets). How, Pico asked, could astrologists possibly claim they could read what was going on when the astronomers they relied on could offer no precision on even basic questions?\\r\\nAs Westman points out, to Rheticus \\"it would seem that Osiander now offered new grounds for endorsing Pico's conclusions: not merely was the disagreement among astronomers grounds for mistrusting the sort of knowledge that they produced, but now Osiander proclaimed that astronomers might construct a world deduced from (possibly) false premises. Thus the conflict between Piconian skepticism and secure principles for the science of the stars was built right into the complex dedicatory apparatus of De Revolutionibus itself.\\"[9] According to the notes of Michael Maestlin, \\"Rheticus...became embroiled in a very bitter wrangle with the printer [over the Ad lectorem]. Rheticus...suspected Osiander had prefaced the work; if he knew this for certain, he declared, he would rough up the fellow so violently that in future he would mind his own business.\\"[10]\\r\\nObjecting to the Ad lectorem, Tiedemann Giese urged the Nuremberg city council to issue a correction, but this was not done, and the matter was forgotten. Jan Broscius, a supporter of Copernicus, also despaired of the Ad lectorem, writing \\"Ptolemy's hypothesis is the earth rests. Copernicus' hypothesis is that the earth is in motion. Can either, therefore, be true??... Indeed, Osiander deceives much with that preface of his?... Hence, someone may well ask: How is one to know which hypothesis is truer, the Ptolemaic or the Copernican?\\"[6]\\r\\nPetreius had sent a copy to Hieronymus Schreiber, an astronomer from Nrnberg who had substituted for Rheticus as professor of mathematics in Wittenberg while Rheticus was in Nrnberg supervising the printing. Schreiber, who died in 1547, left in his copy of the book a note about Osiander's authorship. Via Michael M?stlin, this copy came to Johannes Kepler, who discovered what Osiander had done[11][12] and methodically demonstrated that Osiander had indeed added the foreword.[13] The most knowledgeable astronomers of the time had realized that the foreword was Osiander's doing.\\r\\nOwen Gingerich[14] gives a slightly different version: Kepler knew of Osiander's authorship since he had read about it in one of Schreiber's annotations in his copy of De Revolutionibus; Maestlin learned of the fact from Kepler. Indeed, Maestlin perused Kepler's book, up to the point of leaving a few annotations in it. However, Maestlin already suspected Osiander, because he had bought his De revolutionibus from the widow of Philipp Apian; examining his books, he had found a note attributing the introduction to Osiander.\\r\\nJohannes Praetorius (1537ÿ1616), who learned of Osiander's authorship from Rheticus during a visit to him in Krak܇w, wrote Osiander's name in the margin of the foreword in his copy of De revolutionibus.\\r\\nAll three early editions of De revolutionibus included Osiander's foreword.\\r\\nEven before the 1543 publication of De revolutionibus, rumors circulated about its central theses. Martin Luther is quoted as saying in 1539:\\r\\nPeople gave ear to an upstart astrologer who strove to show that the earth revolves, not the heavens or the firmament, the sun and the moon?... This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy; but sacred Scripture tells us [Joshua 10:13] that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not the earth.[15]\\r\\nWhen the book was finally published, demand was low, with an initial print run of 400 failing to sell out.[16] Copernicus had made the book extremely technical, unreadable to all but the most advanced astronomers of the day, allowing it to disseminate into their ranks before stirring great controversy.[17] And, like Osiander, contemporary mathematicians and astronomers encouraged its audience to view it as a useful mathematical fiction with no physical reality, thereby somewhat shielding it from accusations of blasphemy.[18]\\r\\nAmong some astronomers, the book \\"at once took its place as a worthy successor to the Almagest of Ptolemy, which had hitherto been the Alpha and Omega of astronomers\\".[19] Erasmus Reinhold hailed the work in 1542 and by 1551 had developed the Prutenic Tables (\\"Prussian Tables\\"; Latin: Tabulae prutenicae; German: Preu?ische Tafeln) using Copernicus' methods. The Prutenic Tables, published in 1551, were used as a basis for the calendar reform instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. They were also used by sailors and maritime explorers, whose 15th-century predecessors had used Regiomontanus' Table of the Stars. In England, Robert Recorde, John Dee, Thomas Digges and William Gilbert were among those who adopted his position; in Germany, Christian Wurstisen, Christoph Rothmann and Michael M?stlin, the teacher of Johannes Kepler; in Italy, Giambattista Benedetti and Giordano Bruno whilst Franciscus Patricius accepted the rotation of the earth. In Spain, rules published in 1561 for the curriculum of the University of Salamanca gave students the choice between studying Ptolemy or Copernicus.[20][21] One of those students, Diego de Z~?iga, published an acceptance of Copernican theory in 1584.[22]\\r\\nVery soon, nevertheless, Copernicus' theory was attacked with Scripture and with the common Aristotelian proofs. In 1549 Melanchthon, Luther's principal lieutenant, wrote against Copernicus, pointing to the theory's apparent conflict with Scripture and advocating that \\"severe measures\\" be taken to restrain the impiety of Copernicans.[23] The works of Copernicus and Z~?igathe latter for asserting that De revolutionibus was compatible with Catholic faithwere placed on the Index of Forbidden Books by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of March 5, 1616 (more than 70 years after Copernicus' publication):\\r\\nThis Holy Congregation has also learned about the spreading and acceptance by many of the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to the Holy Scripture, that the earth moves and the sun is motionless, which is also taught by Nicholaus Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium and by Diego de Z~?iga's In Job?... Therefore, in order that this opinion may not creep any further to the prejudice of Catholic truth, the Congregation has decided that the books by Nicolaus Copernicus [De revolutionibus] and Diego de Z~?iga [In Job] be suspended until corrected.[24]\\r\\nDe revolutionibus was not formally banned but merely withdrawn from circulation, pending \\"corrections\\" that would clarify the theory's status as hypothesis. Nine sentences that represented the heliocentric system as certain were to be omitted or changed. After these corrections were prepared and formally approved in 1620 the reading of the book was permitted.[25] But the book was never reprinted with the changes and was available in Catholic jurisdictions only to suitably qualified scholars, by special request.[citation needed] It remained on the Index until 1758, when Pope Benedict XIV (1740ÿ58) removed the uncorrected book from his revised Index.[26]\\r\\nArthur Koestler described De revolutionibus as \\"The Book That Nobody Read\\" saying the book \\"was and is an all-time worst seller\\", despite the fact that it was reprinted four times.[27] Owen Gingerich, a writer on both Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler, disproved this after a 35-year project to examine every surviving copy of the first two editions. Gingerich showed that nearly all the leading mathematicians and astronomers of the time owned and read the book; however, his analysis of the marginalia shows that they almost all ignored the cosmology at the beginning of the book and were only interested in Copernicus' new equant-free models of planetary motion in the later chapters. Also, Nicolaus Reimers in 1587 translated the book into German.\\r\\nGingerich's efforts and conclusions are recounted in The Book Nobody Read, published in 2004 by Walker & Co. His census[28] included 276 copies of the first edition (by comparison, there are 228 extant copies of the First Folio of Shakespeare) and 325 copies of the second.[29] The research behind this book earned its author the Polish government's Order of Merit in 1981. Due largely to Gingerich's scholarship, De revolutionibus has been researched and catalogued better than any other first-edition historic text except for the original Gutenberg Bible.[30] One of the copies now resides at the Archives of the University of Santo Tomas in the Miguel de Benavides Library. In January 2017, a second-edition copy was stolen as part of a heist of rare books from Heathrow Airport and remains unrecovered.[31]\\r\\nEnglish translations of De revolutionibus have included:","input":"What were the views published in de revolutionibus orbium coelestium?"},{"output":"December 20, 2017","context":"The Greatest Showman is a 2017 American musical film directed by Michael Gracey in his directorial debut, written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and starring Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson, and Zendaya. The film is inspired by the story of P. T. Barnum's creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus and the lives of its star attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal photography began in New York City in November 2016. The film premiered on December 8, 2017, aboard the RMS Queen Mary 2. It was released in the United States on December 20, 2017, by 20th Century Fox and grossed over $434?million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest grossing live-action musical of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greatest Showman received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances, music, and production values, but criticism for its artistic license, with some reviewers calling it \\"faux-inspiring and shallow\\".[4][5][6] At the 75th Golden Globe Awards, the film received nominations for Best Motion Picture ÿ Musical or Comedy and Best Actor ÿ Musical or Comedy for Jackman. For the song \\"This Is Me\\", the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and was nominated for Best Original Song at the 90th Academy Awards.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 19th century, P. T. Barnum and his troupe perform a show at the circus (\\"The Greatest Show\\"). In a flashback to Barnum's childhood where he and his father Philo, a tailor, work for the Hallett family, he becomes infatuated with their daughter, Charity. Though Charity is being sent to finishing school, Barnum reassures her they will not be separated. The two keep in touch through letters until they meet again in adulthood (\\"A Million Dreams\\"), eventually marrying and raising two daughters, Caroline and Helen, in New York City (\\"A Million Dreams\\" reprise). They live a humble life; though Charity is happy, Barnum dreams of more.\\r\\n\\r\\nBarnum loses his job as a clerk at a shipping company after the company goes bankrupt. Taking a risky bet, he takes out a large loan from a bank, deceiving the bank into accepting his former employer's lost ships as collateral. He uses this loan to buy Barnum's American Museum in downtown Manhattan, an attraction showcasing various wax models. Initially, sales are slow; on the suggestion of his children to showcase something \\"alive\\", Barnum searches for \\"freaks\\" to serve as performers for his museum (\\"Come Alive\\"). This attracts a large audience despite protests and poor reviews, prompting Barnum to rename his venture \\"Barnum's Circus.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSearching for ways to further his reputation amongst the upper class, Barnum meets playwright Phillip Carlyle and convinces him to join his venture (\\"The Other Side\\"). Carlyle is enchanted with Anne Wheeler, an African-American trapeze artist, but he hides his feelings. During a trip, Carlyle arranges for Barnum and his troupe to meet Queen Victoria. Afterwards, Barnum meets Jenny Lind, a famed Swedish singer, whom he convinces to perform in America, with him serving as her manager. Lind's first American performance is a rousing success (\\"Never Enough\\"). While Barnum gains favor with the aristocratic patrons, he begins to distance himself from his original troupe, refusing to socialize with them. Dejected, they decide to stand against their local harassers (\\"This Is Me\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlyle and Wheeler attend the theater together one night, only to run into Carlyle's parents, who are blatantly racist toward Wheeler, causing her to leave. Carlyle chases her and tries to convince her that they can be together, but she rejects him despite her feelings towards him (\\"Rewrite the Stars\\"). As Barnum takes Lind on a US tour, Charity feels isolated from her husband as she stays home with their daughters (\\"Tightrope\\"). While on tour, Lind begins falling in love with Barnum, but when he refuses her advances, she calls off the tour and kisses him at the end of her last show, which is photographed by the press (\\"Never Enough\\" reprise). Barnum returns home to find his circus on fire, caused by a fight between the protesters and the troupe. Carlyle, who had tried to save Anne not knowing she had already escaped, is rescued by Barnum amid the chaos but suffers severe burns. Most of the sets and props are destroyed. Word of Lind's cancellation and Barnum's public intimacy also reaches New York, resulting in his mansion being foreclosed upon and Charity taking Caroline and Helen to her parents' home.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepressed, Barnum retreats to a local bar, where his troupe find him there and explain that despite their disappointments, they still consider themselves a family that needs him. An inspired Barnum resolves to start anew and not let ambition overtake his loved ones anymore. Meanwhile, the injured Carlyle wakes in a hospital with Anne by his side and they share a kiss (\\"From Now On\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nBarnum leaves and finds his estranged wife, and they decide to mend their relationship. Faced with the financial difficulty of rebuilding the circus, the recovering Carlyle steps in, offering to use his earnings from his share of the circus's profits to rebuild it under the condition of becoming partners, which Barnum happily accepts. As rebuilding the circus in its original location would be too expensive, Barnum rebuilds it as an open-air tent circus by the docks. The revamped circus is a huge success, and Barnum gives full control of the show to Carlyle so he can focus on his family (\\"The Greatest Show\\" reprise).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project was first announced in 2009, with Jackman already set for the title role.[11] In August 2011, Michael Gracey was chosen to direct.[12] In 2013, Fox hired lyricists Pasek and Paul to write the songs.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 15, 2016, Zac Efron began negotiations to star in the film,[14] and in July 2016, Michelle Williams was cast.[15][16][17][18] The film was choreographed by Ashley Wallen.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nRehearsals on the film began in October 2016 in New York City, and principal photography began on November 22, 2016.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2017, it was reported that James Mangold, who had worked with Jackman on several projects (including 2017's Logan), had been brought in to serve as an executive producer during the film's post-production.

In most modern legal systems, children and teens who commit a crime are treated differently from legal adults that have committed the same offense.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrialized countries differ in whether juveniles should be tried as adults for serious crimes or considered separately.  Since the 1970s, minors have been tried increasingly as adults in response to \\"increases in violent juvenile crime.\\" Young offenders may still not be prosecuted as adults. Serious offenses, such as murder or rape, can be prosecuted through adult court in England.[1] However, as of 2007, no United States data reported any exact numbers of juvenile offenders prosecuted as adults.[2] In contrast, countries such as Australia and Japan are in the early stages of developing and implementing youth-focused justice initiatives as a deferment from adult court.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobally, the United Nations' has encouraged nations to reform their systems to fit with a model in which \\"entire society [must] ensure the harmonious development of adolescence\\" despite the delinquent behavior that may be causing issues. The hope was to create a more \\"child-friendly justice\\". Despite all the changes made by the United Nations, the rules in practice are less clear cut.[1] Changes in a broad context cause issues of implementation locally, and international crimes committed by youth are causing additional questions regarding the benefit of separate proceedings for juveniles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIssues of juvenile justice have become increasingly global in several cultural contexts. As globalization has occurred in recent centuries, issues of justice, and more specifically protecting the rights of children as it relates to juvenile courts, have been called to question. Global policies regarding this issue have become more widely accepted, and a general culture of treatment of children offenders has adapted to this trend.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuvenile court is a special court or department of a trial court that deals with under-age defendants who are charged with crimes, are neglected, or are out of the control of their parents. The normal age of these defendants is under 18, but the age of majority changes based on the state or nation. Juvenile court does not have jurisdiction in cases in which minors are charged as adults. The procedure in juvenile court is not always adversarial, although the minor is entitled to legal representation by a lawyer. Parents or social workers and probation officers may be involved in the process to achieve positive results and save the minor from involvement in future crimes. However, serious crimes and repeated offenses can result in sentencing juvenile offenders to prison, with transfer to a state prison upon reaching adulthood with limited maximum sentences, often until the age of 18, 21, 23 or 25. Where parental neglect or loss of control is a problem, the juvenile court may seek out foster homes for the juvenile, treating the child as a ward of the court. A juvenile court handles cases of both delinquency and dependency.  Delinquency refers to crimes committed by minors, and dependency includes cases where a non-parental person is chosen to care for a minor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen looking at juvenile justice as a whole two types of models tend to be used: restorative justice and criminal justice.[3] Within the United States, there are systematic shifts towards a more restorative model of justice especially surrounding juveniles. Canada has long been practicing under a restorative model of justice and continues to grow and expand upon practices of integrating youth offenders into the community in hopes that they do not recidivate but become positive, contributing members of society. In addition to these countries, Austria has taken an initiative to implement victim-offender mediation programs geared towards a more restorative form of justice. New Zealand completely restructured their system with an emphasis on what the indigenous people, Mori, practiced for many years. This includes a family-centered focus that lowers youth incarceration. Globally, there is a trend of utilizing the traditional values of past generations to create a positive impact throughout juvenile court systems.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an era where crimes against the state, in violation of international law are prosecuted, children who are subjected to this crime are now being called into question on how to deal with them. More precisely this problem applies to children soldiers. Controversy has risen in regards to starting a special juvenile court or 'special court' for children being prosecuted for international crimes. In Sierra Leone, for example, people wanted the perpetrators to be held entirely responsible despite age or social context. When a juvenile is deferred to the special court, their treatment would be treated with more respect as well as a promotion of rehabilitation and reintegration, taking into account how young many of the child soldiers were. The Secretary General termed the use of the tribunals as a \\"moral dilemma\\". The children who become soldiers often do so as a result of a structural or systemic threat in their lives; however, they still are responsible for many violent and heinous acts. In this way they are both victims of regimes and guilty parties, causing the problem and dilemma that the United Nations has tried to address in Sierra Leone as well as other countries.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the rules governing juvenile court vary significantly from state to state, the broad goal of U.S. juvenile courts is to provide a remedial or rehabilitative alternative to the adult criminal justice system. Although not always met, the ideal is to put a juvenile offender on the correct path to be a law-abiding adult.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nRules for jurisdiction of a juvenile court depend upon the state. In most states, juvenile court jurisdiction continues through the age of eighteen, but in some states it may end at age seventeen or younger. At times, a juvenile offender who is initially charged in juvenile court will be waived to adult court, meaning that the offender may be tried and sentenced in the same manner as an adult.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no uniform national age from which a child is accountable in the juvenile court system; this varies between states.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nStates vary in relation to the age at which a child may be subject to juvenile court proceedings for delinquent behavior. Most states do not specify a minimum age as a matter of law.[8] Of states that set a minimum age, for status offenses:[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for delinquency:[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll states have laws that allow, and at times require, young offenders to be prosecuted or sentenced as adults for more serious offenses, Without regard to their age.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Kent v. United States (1966), the United States Supreme Court held that a juvenile must be afforded due process rights, specifically that a waiver of jurisdiction from a juvenile court to a district court must be voluntary and knowing.[9] The U.S. Supreme Court held, in the case of In re Gault (1967),[10][11] that children accused in a juvenile delinquency proceeding have the rights to due process, counsel, and against self-incrimination, essentially the Miranda rights.  Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Abe Fortas wrote, \\"Under our Constitution, the condition of being a boy does not justify a kangaroo court.\\"[12] However, most juvenile proceedings are held without a jury as McKeiver v. Pennsylvania (1971) decided that minors do not have the same rights in this regard as adults.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some jurisdictions, in addition to delinquent cases, juvenile court hears cases involving child custody, child support, and visitation as well as cases where children are alleged to be abused or neglected.\\r\\n\\r\\nProcedures in juvenile court, for juveniles charged with delinquent acts (acts that would be crimes if committed by adults) or status offenses (offenses that can only be committed by minors, such as running away from home, curfew violations and truancy) are typically less formal than proceedings in adult courts.[5] Proceedings may be closed to the public, and a juvenile offender's name may be kept out of the public record.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an American juvenile court, it is possible to avoid placing formal charges. Factors that may affect a court's treatment of a juvenile offender and the disposition of the case include:[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with these seven, four \\"unofficial\\" factors can sway an official:[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Connecticut, a referral can be made to a non-court associated committee referred to as a Juvenile Review Board. These boards can present a resolution that does not result in a juvenile criminal record. However, there are circumstances such as the types of cases the board will accept.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuvenile court sentences may range from:[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMandatory minimum sentences found their way into the juvenile justice system in the late 1970s out of concern that some juveniles were committing very serious criminal offenses. Mandatory minimum sentences might be imposed in juvenile court for some very serious crimes, such as homicide, and apply to juveniles in the same manner as adults if the juvenile is waived to adult court.[14] The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the use of mandatory life sentences for juvenile offenders is unconstitutional.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his 1997 book No Matter How Loud I Shout, a study of the Los Angeles' Juvenile Courts, Edward Humes argued that juvenile court systems are in need of radical reform. He stated that the system sends too many children with good chances of rehabilitation to adult court while pushing aside and acquitting children early on the road to crime instead of giving counseling, support, and accountability. 57% of children arrested for the first time are never arrested again, 27% are arrested one or two more times, and 16% commit four or more crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States specifically, there are arguments made against having a separate court for youths and juvenile delinquents. From this perspective, the construction of youth and being young is morphing and as such people believe the legal system should reflect these changes. Childhood currently, looks very different and is socially constructed in a much different pattern than in past historical context. Some argue that within our current social climate, a juvenile court system and having a separate deferment for people under the age of majority is no longer necessary as there are such blurred lines between the stages of childhood, youth, and young adulthood.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a global scale, the United Nations has implemented reforms as it relating to juvenile courts and juvenile justice as a whole. Rules and regulations have been implemented to protect the children's rights, more specifically creating guidelines for punishment. Movements towards less punitive measures or agencies have been a trend in this regard. For example, in the United Nations general assembly, there was a proposal that \\"no child or young person should be subjected to harsh or degrading correction or punishment measures\\".[1] Many Western countries have been condemned for not put these policies into practice nor differentiate the youths from adults in procedure or punishment. The United Nations believes that youths should have less harsh punishment and be deferred to more community supportive programs like tribunals or courts geared towards young people. In Western Europe, there are many countries also criticized and looked at by the United Nations for the disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic minorities in the juvenile court system of the racial and ethnic minority being over-represented.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current regime allows for many systemic perpetuations of class divides, discrimination and gender inequalities. Another reform made by the United Nations is \\"informalism\\"  in the mid-1900s where a push for diversion and less criminalizing happened. This was when many deferred programs and alternatives to formal criminal and adult jurisdictions changed, making it more child-friendly. In more recent years, the restorative justice model has been promoted as a better way to process and reintegrate youth who are involved in the court system back into the community. This model is multifaceted and requires a change in the cultural understanding of what it means to commit a crime as a person under the age of majority. The United Nations has offered aid to countries looking to move towards a restorative justice model as it is a positive change in from a human rights discourse.[1] Difficulty in implementing restorative justice comes with cultural differences cross-nationally as well as the scope and breadth of the model. Additionally, the traditional values of adversarial justice have been rooted in the juvenile system for a very long time, which makes it difficult implement change on a global scale. Overall, the United Nation's attempts at changing the conversation and structure surrounding juvenile courts, have made small strides as many other issues continually being addressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also many arguments against the globalization of the reforms of juvenile court systems. Global juvenile justice lacks solutions to the flaws that come out of placing them in such a broad range of social contexts. For example, the case study of Moroccan youth as well as other ethnic minorities or migrant groups living in the Netherlands. There is a disconnect between the idea that crime is a local social problem, but there are movements to solve the problems more generically and on a much broader spectrum. In the Netherlands, the emphasis of juvenile court is rehabilitation despite the reality being a more punitive focused system when placed in practice. Juvenile courts cause further system bias and exclusion for these minority groups, and the disparity is a source of concern. One reason for this problem is the public discourse and police scrutinyall of which stem from the failed cultural integration. Globalization of youth justice and the court then perpetuates this idea of an \\"international scapegoat\\" and causes issues that need more careful consideration for the putting global practices to work in local communities. As some scholars argue, globalization does not simplify the problem but rather complicates it as it challenges \\"traditional modes of analysis\\" and creates problems of identity.[17]","input":"What type of jurisdiction does a juvenile court have?"},{"output":"December 23","context":"It is very rare for snow to fall in the U.S. state of Florida, especially in the central and southern portions of the state. With the exception of the far northern areas of the state and the Jacksonville area, most of the major cities of Florida have never recorded measurable snowfall, have only recorded trace (T) amounts, or have only reported flurries in the air, usually just a few times each century.

The only other areas in the continental United States with this distinction are extreme southern Texas and parts of coastal southern California.[3]\\r\\nMuch of the known information on snow in Florida prior to 1900 is from climatological records provided by the National Weather Service meteorological station in Jacksonville, and information for other locations is sparse. The earliest recorded instance of snow in Florida occurred in 1774; being unaccustomed to snow, some Jacksonville residents called it \\"extraordinary white rain.\\"[1] The first White Christmas in northeastern Florida's history resulted from a snow event that occurred on December 23, 1989.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to larger populations and more advanced communication networks, snow events are witnessed and reported much more frequently in recent years than in historical eras. Interpretations of this timeline must therefore be made with caution, as observed patterns may not reflect actual climate-related trends in annual snowfall but rather improved reporting.","input":"When did it snow in pinellas county florida?"},{"output":"Gastric acid, gastric juice or stomach acid","context":"Gastric acid, gastric juice or stomach acid, is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach and is composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl).  The acid plays a key role in digestion of proteins, by activating digestive enzymes, and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of amino acids.\\r\\nGastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach, which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed.  Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate, a base, to buffer the fluid, ensuring that it does not become too acidic.  These cells also produce mucus, which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach. The pancreas further produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main constituent of gastric acid is hydrochloric acid which is produced by parietal cells (also called oxyntic cells) in the gastric glands in the stomach. Its secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process. Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called canaliculi) from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5[1] in the human stomach lumen, the acidity being maintained by the proton pump H+/K+ ATPase. The parietal cell releases bicarbonate into the bloodstream in the process, which causes a temporary rise of pH in the blood, known as an alkaline tide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highly acidic environment in the stomach lumen causes proteins from food to lose their characteristic folded structure (or denature). This exposes the protein's peptide bonds. The gastric chief cells of the stomach secrete enzymes for protein breakdown (inactive pepsinogen, and in infancy rennin). Hydrochloric acid activates pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin, which then helps digestion by breaking the bonds linking amino acids, a process known as proteolysis. In addition, many microorganisms have their growth inhibited by such an acidic environment, which is helpful to prevent infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nA typical adult human stomach will secrete about 1.5 liters of gastric acid daily.[2] Gastric acid secretion happens in several steps. Chloride and hydrogen ions are secreted separately from the cytoplasm of parietal cells and mixed in the canaliculi. Gastric acid is then secreted into the lumen of the gastric gland and gradually reaches the main stomach lumen.[2]  The exact manner in which the secreted acid reaches the stomach lumen is controversial, as acid must first cross the relatively pH neutral gastric mucus layer.\\r\\n\\r\\nChloride and sodium ions are secreted actively from the cytoplasm of the parietal cell into the lumen of the canaliculus. This creates a negative potential of -40 mV to -70 mV across the parietal cell membrane that causes potassium ions and a small number of sodium ions to diffuse from the cytoplasm into the parietal cell canaliculi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyses the reaction between carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid. This acid immediately dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions. The hydrogen ions leave the cell through H+/K+ ATPase antiporter pumps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, sodium ions are actively reabsorbed. This means that the majority of secreted K+ and Na+ ions return to the cytoplasm. In the canaliculus, secreted hydrogen and chloride ions mix and are secreted into the lumen of the oxyntic gland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest concentration that gastric acid reaches in the stomach is 160 mM in the canaliculi. This is about 3 million times that of arterial blood, but almost exactly isotonic with other bodily fluids. The lowest pH of the secreted acid is 0.8,[3] but the acid is diluted in the stomach lumen to a pH between 1 and 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a small continuous basal secretion of gastric acid between meals of usually less than 10 mEq/hour.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three phases in the secretion of gastric acid which increase the secretion rate in order to digest a meal:[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nGastric acid production is regulated by both the autonomic nervous system and several hormones. The parasympathetic nervous system, via the vagus nerve, and the hormone gastrin stimulate the parietal cell to produce gastric acid, both directly acting on parietal cells and indirectly, through the stimulation of the secretion of the hormone histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells (ECL). Vasoactive intestinal peptide, cholecystokinin, and secretin all inhibit production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production of gastric acid in the stomach is tightly regulated by positive regulators and negative feedback mechanisms. Four types of cells are involved in this process: parietal cells, G cells, D cells and enterochromaffine-like cells. Besides this, the endings of the vagus nerve (CN X) and the intramural nervous plexus in the digestive tract influence the secretion significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNerve endings in the stomach secrete two stimulatory neurotransmitters: acetylcholine and gastrin-releasing peptide. Their action is both direct on parietal cells and mediated through the secretion of gastrin from G cells and histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells. Gastrin acts on parietal cells directly and indirectly too, by stimulating the release of histamine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe release of histamine is the most important positive regulation mechanism of the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach. Its release is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine and inhibited by somatostatin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the duodenum, gastric acid is neutralized by sodium bicarbonate. This also blocks gastric enzymes that have their optima in the acid range of pH. The secretion of sodium bicarbonate from the pancreas is stimulated by secretin. This polypeptide hormone gets activated and secreted from so-called S cells in the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum when the pH in the duodenum falls below 4.5 to 5.0. The neutralization is described by the equation:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carbonic acid rapidly equilibrates with carbon dioxide and water through catalysis by carbonic anhydrase enzymes bound to the gut epithelial lining,[6] leading to a net release of carbon dioxide gas within the lumen associated with neutralisation. In the absorptive upper intestine, such as the duodenum, both the dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid will tend to equilibrate with the blood, leading to most of the gas produced on neutralisation being exhaled through the lungs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria, there is low or no gastric acid in the stomach, potentially leading to problems as the disinfectant properties of the gastric lumen are decreased.  In such conditions, there is greater risk of infections of the digestive tract (such as infection with Vibrio or Helicobacter bacteria).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn ZollingerÿEllison syndrome and hypercalcemia, there are increased gastrin levels, leading to excess gastric acid production, which can cause gastric ulcers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn diseases featuring excess vomiting, patients develop hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (decreased blood acidity by H+ and chlorine depletion).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proton pump enzyme is the target of proton pump inhibitors, used to increase gastric pH (and hence decrease stomach acidity) in diseases that feature excess acid. H2 antagonists  indirectly decrease gastric acid production. Antacids neutralize existing acid.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of gastric acid in digestion was established in the 1820s and 1830s by William Beaumont on Alexis St. Martin, who, as a result of an accident, had a fistula (hole) in his stomach, which allowed Beaumont to observe the process of digestion and to extract gastric acid, verifying that acid played a crucial role in digestion.[7]","input":"What is the acid in the stomach called?"},{"output":"Twelfth grade","context":"Twelfth grade, senior year, or grade 12 is the final year of secondary school in North America. In other regions it is also equivalently referred as class 12 or Year 13. In most countries students then graduate at age 17ÿ18. Some countries have a thirteenth grade, while other countries do not have a 12th grade/year at all. Twelfth grade is typically the last year of high school; graduation year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia, the twelfth grade is referred to as Year 12. In New South Wales, students are usually 16 or 17 years old when they enter Year 12 and 17ÿ18 years during graduation (end of year). A majority of students in Year 12 work towards getting an ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) or OP (Overall Position, which applies only to students in the state of Queensland), which will allow them access to courses at university.[1][2][3][4] In South Australia, this is achieved by completing the SACE; in Victoria, this is achieved by completing the VCE; in the Australian Capital Territory, this is achieved by completing the AST[5] and in New South Wales this is achieved by completing the HSC.[6]\\r\\nIn New South Wales, when completing the [HSC], students are required to satisfactorily complete at least 10 units of study in ATAR courses which must include:\\r\\nSome Year 12s may receive a Year 12 Jersey. Schools choose the design, colours and writing which are printed or stitched onto the jersey. Sometimes the last two digits of the year they are graduating are printed on the back (for example, \\"12\\" for 2012 school leavers) along with a personalised nickname. The front may show the school emblem and the student's name, which is occasionally stitched in.\\r\\nMany schools conduct end of year \\"formals\\" (similar to a senior prom). They are held from any time between graduation in September to November. Australian private schools often conduct Year 12 balls in January or February of Year 12 instead of an end of year formal.\\r\\nIn Belgium, the 12th grade is called 6de middelbaar or laatste jaar in Dutch, rtho or 6e anne in French. In the General Education, this year guides and prepares students for their first year in University by recalling everything learned during the past six years of secondary school. In the Skills Education, this year prepares the students for the professional life with an Intership in the chosen domain.\\r\\nIn Brazil, the 12th grade is called terceiro ano do ensino mdio, also informally called terceiro colegial, meaning literally third grade of high school. It is typically attended by 17ÿ18 years old students. During this grade, most students apply to what is called Exame Nacional do Ensino Mdio (ENEM), the Brazilian equivalent of the SATs in the US, and vestibular, the individual entrance examination particular to each university.\\r\\nAs in many countries, Grade 12 students attend Graduation, which involves a formal official ceremony, a party where students, relatives and friends are invited and another party just for the students.\\r\\nIn Bulgaria the twelfth grade is the last year of high-school. Twelfth-grade students tend to be 18ÿ19 years old. Usually students are preparing to take the Matriculation exam in the end of their 2nd semester.\\r\\nIn Canada, the twelfth grade is referred to as Grade 12. Grade 12 is the 12th year after kindergarten. Students generally enter their Grade 12 year when they are 16 or 17 years old. If they are 16 years old, they will be turning 17 by December 31 of that year. In many Canadian high schools, student during their year, hold a series of fundraisers, grade-class trips, and other social events. Grade 12 Canadian students attend Graduation which usually involves an official ceremony and a dinner dance.\\r\\nOntario previously had Grade 13, which was briefly renamed Ontario Academic Credit (OAC), before being phased out, leaving Grade 12 as the final year. Grades 12 and 13 were similar to sixth form in England.\\r\\nQuebec is the lone province that does not have Grade 12; their students finish secondary school at the equivalent of Grade 11 and then do two years of college before going to university. Thus, when a student is in Grade 12 in Ontario, for instance, the student in Quebec is in his first year of college.\\r\\nNewfoundland and Labrador did not introduce Grade 12 until 1983.\\r\\nIn Denmark, the twelfth grade is the 3rd G, which is the final year of secondary school. 3.g is equivalent to 3rd grade of secondary school, or gymnasium. This is not compulsory, as education is only compulsory through 9th grade. Students are often 18-19 or older when they finish secondary school. The age of graduation is caused by the fact that Danish children first start school at 6. The reason that many students will be at the age of 20 when they graduate is because some people choose to have one-year gap between the 9th grade and gymnasium's 1st G (the first year of secondary school), where students typically go to special art- or sport-oriented boarding schools or become exchange students all over the world. This is optional though; you can go directly to the first year of secondary school after 9th grade.\\r\\nThe twelfth grade is the third and usually last year (a fourth year is possible) of High School or secondary school (or Gymnasium) The students graduate from High School the year they turn 19. The twelfth grade is shorter than the previous ones because the twelfth graders lessons end in February and they go on to take their final exams shortly afterwards. Compulsory education ends after the ninth grade, so the upper grades are optional.\\r\\nThe equivalent grade in this country is Terminale, it is the third year of lyce which is equivalent to High-School, upon completion of which students sit for a test, the Baccalaurat. French-language schools that teach the French government curriculum (i.e. are part of the AEFE network) use the same system of grades as their counterparts in France. This is not compulsory, as education is only compulsory until students turn 16.\\r\\nIn Germany, students wishing to take the Abitur usually had to attend a thirteenth grade, but most states are shortening the Gymnasium (the university-bound secondary school system in Germany) from nine to eight years.\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, 12th grade is called Form 6. Students in Form 6 are required to take the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE)\\r\\nIn India, the equivalent grade is referred to as the \\"HSC\\", or \\"plus 2\\" or in some regions \\"second year junior college\\" (SYJC) or PreUniversity Course (PUC). Most students who pass out of class 12 are 16-18 years old. With the introduction of separate entrance examinations for entry into medicine, engineering and law courses. Entrance exams usually comprise multiple-choice-questions on physics, chemistry and biology (or mathematics) and are conducted separately on national and state levels. Additionally some highly coveted institutions hold their own entrance tests. These competitive exams are among the toughest in the world with JEE MAIN, administered by CBSE being the second most competitive entrance exam. Over 14,00,000 students also appear for the IIT-JEE exam, competing for 9,800 odd seats at the IITs. From this year, NEET exam has been introduced for all medical admissions barring a few and is considered tougher than JEE MAIN due to lesser seats. The AIIMS entrance test is also one of the toughest exams for admission to undergraduate courses in medicine. Around 80,000 students compete for 50 seats. The CBSE and ICSE boards conduct twelfth standard courses nationally, while state boards operate at the state-level.\\r\\nIn the Republic of Ireland, it is the sixth and final year of Secondary School, referred to as Sixth Year (for 17-18 year olds), in which students take the Leaving Certificate Examinations. Students usually attend a dance or formal party at the end of this year before they move on to third level education or start their adult lives: this is known as a Debs or Grad and is similar to prom in the United States.\\r\\nIn Northern Ireland there is a 7th year of primary school and a 7th year of secondary school.\\r\\nIn Israel, the twelfth grade is the third and last year of High School. Students typically begin this grade when they are about 17 years old, and in order to graduate, they have to pass and get a Bagrut certificate. Once finished, student are required to either serve in the Israeli military or do the Israeli community service for a time period (the number of years may vary).\\r\\nIn Italy, the twelfth grade is the fourth year of the high school (which is called Scuola media superiore or Scuola secondaria di secondo grado). There are five years of high school total, sometimes grouped in different ways (2+3, 2+1+2), depending on the type of high school the student is attending. Students get the \\"Maturit\\", when they are at the fifth year of high school, de facto the thirteenth grade.\\r\\nIn Lebanon, the twelfth grade is the third year of high school, also referred to as The Third Year Of Higher Secondary Education. It can be called the class of seniors or the last class of school. People in the twelfth grade are between the ages of 17 and 18.[7]\\r\\nIn Malaysia, the 12th grade is also known as Form 6 in secondary school which is further divided into Lower 6 and Upper 6. The students at this stage are 18 years old and will usually complete their schooling at 19 years old.\\r\\nIn Mexico, the twelfth grade is the last year of high school, where students are normally aged 17ÿ18. As in Mexico the education is divided in \\"primaria\\" (6 years), \\"secundaria\\" (3 years) and \\"preparatoria\\" or \\"bachillerato\\" (3 years), the twelfth grade is usually called \\"tercero de preparatoria\\" (third grade of preparatory) or \\"Quinto y Sexto Semestre\\" (Fifth and Sixth Semester).\\r\\nIn New Zealand, 12th grade is known as Year 13 (New Zealand students attend 13 years of school, starting at the age of 5). Students in Year 13 are usually 17ÿ18 years old. This is the last year of secondary school. In Year 13, students complete NCEA Level 3, which involves getting a certain number of 'credits' from different external exams and other internal assessments. Students must gain 80 achieved credits or higher (20 of which are taken from Level 2) to pass the year.[8]\\r\\nIn the Netherlands, 12th grade is named by school level. From low to high: \\"VMBO\\", \\"HAVO\\" and \\"VWO\\". VMBO is composed of four years, with 12th grade being the fourth (4th) and final year. A higher school level is the HAVO, which lasts for five (5) years. The highest school level is VWO, which lasts for six (6) years. So at the HAVO, students are considered senior if they are in \\"5th class\\", whereas at VWO, in \\"6th class\\" respectively. The last year mainly focuses on preparing for the final exams, after which students should be ready to go to college or university. Usually, 4th and 5th grade students are aged 16 to 17 and those who are in 6th grade usually are aged 17 to 18.[9]\\r\\nIn Norway, 12th grade does not officially exist, but its equivalent is the 2nd grade of secondary school, or gymnasium. This is not compulsory, as education is only compulsory until 10th grade.\\r\\nCourses vary as students choose a specific programme in 1st grade of secondary school, or gymnasium. Examples of programmes are: General Studies, Media and Communication, Health and Care, Industrial work, Design and craftmanship, agriculture. There are 12 national programmes, where 9 will get the students ready for work, and 3 will prepare the students for more advanced studies. Two of the vocational programs (media and communication, and agriculture) may also prepare the students for more advanced studies if taken a third year.\\r\\nIn Pakistan, the twelfth grade is the second and final year of college (the first being the eleventh grade) and is equivalently called the \\"second year.\\" Students who graduate from the second year are normally between seventeen and eighteen years old. For entrance into universities and postgraduate education, students undergo standardised academic exams conducted by the National Testing Service.\\r\\nFrom 1945 until 2011, the basic education system was composed of six years of elementary education starting at the age of 6, and four years of high school education starting at the age of 12 (in which the fourth year was the equivalent of tenth grade/Grade 10). Further education was provided by technical or vocational schools, or in higher education institutions such as universities. Although the 1987 Constitution stated that elementary education was compulsory, this was never enforced.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2011, the country started to transition from its old 10-year basic educational system to a K to 12 educational system as mandated by the Department of Education; the department stated that the 10-year basic educational system was congested and designed for twelve years of teaching, not ten. Thus, the K to 12 system was introduced in order to establish educational continuity not just integrated with the ASEAN region system of basic education but aligned with the rest of the world.[10] The 12-year system is currently compulsory, along with the adoption of an improved, decongested curriculum for all schools (see 2010s and the Kÿ12 program). The transition period will end with the 2017ÿ2018 school year, which is the first graduation year for the first group of students who entered the new educational system. Grade 12 is the second year of Senior High School and is now the new final year of high school prior to employment, entrepreneurship, or college/university in the country. Students are usually 17 ÿ 18 years old.\\r\\nIn Portugal, the 12th grade is considered the last year of compulsory education and the last year of high school. Students choose 5 out of a wide range of subjects, one of which being mandatorily physical education. Out of the other four, two of them are the subjects that will be evaluated in their final exams or national exams (exames nacionais), one must be considered a branch of one of the two subjects that have been already evaluated in the 11th grade national exams and the last can be a broadening of an already studied subject or a whole new one. The obligatory subjects (submitted to nacional exams)depend on the field the student chose to study in the 10th grade:arts; science and technologies (best known as science);socioeconomic sciences (economy); humanistic and linguistic sciences (humanities) or a professional/technical course. Even inside a field, you can opt between speciefics (subjects, whose exam is compulsory to a certain college course application), depending on what the student intends to study in college and on which university he plans to attend.\\r\\nIn Scotland, this is sixth year (or S6). Sufficiently good marks in 5th year may be adequate for entry into higher education. Highers are the entry qualifications to university which can be sat in S5, S6 and college, with Advanced Highers being the equivalent to year one of university[11] which can be sat following higher exams.\\r\\nIn South Africa, Grade 12 is the final year of high school. It is more commonly referred to as matric, which is itself short for matriculation. (See Matriculation in South Africa).\\r\\nAt the end of Grade 12, students are said to be matriculated. This also refers to the minimum requirement for progressing to University. On average, Grade 12 students are between the ages of 17 and 19.\\r\\nIn Sweden, the twelfth grade does not officially exist, but its equivalent is the 3rd grade of secondary school, or gymnasium. This is not compulsory, as education is only compulsory until 9th grade.\\r\\nCourses vary as students choose a specific programme in 1st grade of secondary school, or gymnasium. Examples of programmes are: Nature and science, Arts, Economics, Health and care, Industry. There are 18 national programmes, where 12 of them will get the students ready for work, and 6 will prepare the students for more advanced studies.\\r\\nStudents graduate the same year they'll turn 19, depending on if you are born early or late in the year you are either 19 or 18 at the day of your graduation.\\r\\nIn Turkey, 12th grade is the last year of high school and compulsory education. In March, students who are interested to go to college take a test named Transition to Higher Education Examination (YGS). In this exam, students have to answer 160 questions (40 Turkish, 31 Maths, 9 Geometry, 15 History, 12 Geography, 8 Philosophy, 5 Religious Knowledge, 13 Biology, 14 Physics, 13 Chemistry) in 160 minutes. Those who answer correct at least 25% of this questions are allowed to take the Undergraduate Placement Examination (LYS). This exam also has different sessions for different branches, which include Mathematics, Geometry, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Turkish Literature, History, Geography, Philosophy, Religious Knowledge and Foreign Languages. It is not compulsory to take all of the subjects. Students usually are at the age of 18 at the end of the year.\\r\\nIn England and Wales, \\"Year 13\\" (or \\"upper Sixth\\") is the last year of A-Level certifications, which are completed at the end of the year. Students are usually 16-17 in Year 12 and 17-18 in Year 13. In Northern Ireland this takes place in Years 13 and 14. In England, these two years are now compulsory as of 2015 and are generally required for entry into higher education. There exist specific sixth form colleges dedicated to these years of education, sometimes known as \\"further education\\" to distinguish it from both secondary education, which is compulsory, and higher education, which implies university studies.\\r\\nIn Scotland, this is sixth year (or S6). Sufficiently good marks in 5th year may be adequate for entry into higher education. Highers are the entry qualifications to university which can be sat in S5, S6 and college, with Advanced Highers being the equivalent to year one of university[3] which can be sat following higher exams.\\r\\nThe twelfth grade is the twelfth school year after kindergarten. It is also the last year of compulsory secondary education, or \\"high school\\". Students often enter the grade as 17- and 18-year-olds and graduate as mostly 17 or 18-year-olds. Twelfth graders are referred to as Seniors.[citation needed]\\r\\nMany students consider the twelfth grade a year to relax and prepare for transition out of their old lives into college/university or the workplace. Others take advantage of the opportunity to complete additional higher level courses, such as Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate, to earn credits for college/university.\\r\\nMathematics courses normally include Pre-Calculus, Trigonometry, College Prep Math, Advanced Placement Calculus, Advanced Placement Statistics, Probability and Statistics, or SUPA Calculus.\\r\\nScience courses include Advanced Placement Chemistry, Advanced Placement Biology, Advanced Placement Environmental Science, Astronomy/Meteorology, CSI Forensic Science, Marine Biology or Advanced Placement Physics B, Advanced Placement Physics C: Mechanics, or Advanced Placement Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism.\\r\\nSocial Studies courses include Government Law, Economics, Advanced Placement United States Government and Politics, Advanced Placement Comparative Government and Politics, Advanced Placement Psychology, Advanced Placement European History, Advanced Placement Microeconomics, or Advanced Placement Macroeconomics.\\r\\nEnglish classes include Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition, Film and Literature, Sports and Literature, or Contemporary Lit. Popular works include Beowulf, The Canterbury Tales, Pygmalion, The Handmaid's Tale, Frankenstein, Othello, Inferno, Goethe's Faust, Hamlet, and Brave New World, as well as works of Romantic poets such as Edgar Allan Poe, John Keats, William Wordsworth, and Emily Dickinson.\\r\\nArt classes include Advanced Placement Art History, Advanced Placement Studio Art, Advanced Placement Music Theory, Applied art in Theatre, Music Theory For Garage Band Musicians, IB Musical Analysis, IB Theatre Arts, Advanced Technical Theatre, Advanced Photography, Advanced Cyramics, Fashion Design and Illustration, Theatre Dance, Jazz Dance, IB Dance Studies Madrigal Singers, Jazz Singers, or Wind Ensemble.\\r\\nTechnology classes include Advanced Placement Computer Science, Java, Advanced Web Design, and C++ Programming.\\r\\nBusiness classes include College Marketing, College Entrepreneurship, Sports and Entertainment Marketing, College Preparatory Interview Classes, and Advanced Fundamentals in Business.\\r\\nWellness classes include Physical Education, Health (if not yet taken), Weightlifting, and Advanced Training in First Aid.\\r\\nIn the United States and some other countries, there is a graduation event near to the end of the school year (typically in May or June) more formally referred to as commencement, where \\"seniors\\" formally graduate from high school and receive their diplomas.\\r\\nIn many schools, seniors sit for formal senior portraits at the beginning of the school year or the summer prior to their senior year. These portraits are used in the upcoming graduating class' yearbook. The senior portraits in the yearbook are either in full color or black and white, but bigger than the smaller black and white pictures typically used for lower grades. Many modern yearbooks are in full color. Some may have a caption other than the student's name, or a quote from the student.\\r\\nThere is a formal dance for this year's students, called senior prom. Some schools hold a combined prom for juniors and seniors, while others segregate the two grades into separate dances.\\r\\nSenior skip day (also known as senior ditch day) is a day during which the seniors do not attend school and skip all their classes. This event/tradition is often not recognized by school administrations and teachers. In some areas it is countered with an officially recognized senior day off, or by allowing graduating seniors to skip their final tests (\\"final exams\\"). This official senior day can also be used to sponsor a \\"senior field trip\\" or \\"senior class trip\\" where the class would, for example, go to a theme park, a lake, a resort, the beach, or some other vacation-type activity. Following graduation, many seniors go on Senior Week, where they spend a week at the beach with their friends.[12] Many seniors that are in the arts (but sometimes other areas), such as band or choir, will have the opportunity to go on an extended vacation following graduation. The students, faculty, parents, and other people may fund the trip through fundraisers, donations, etc. Travel usually involves going out of the local state, and possibly overseas.\\r\\nIn some schools, Seniors receive a class ring at the beginning of their senior year.[citation needed] A \\"senior prank\\" is another common tradition in which the class may contribute towards a practical joke on the school, administration, or local community. A related tradition is the senior class either raising money or contributing money for equipment or other things to the school as a token of gratitude and respect for the school's support of the seniors. An example of this could be a senior class contributing money for a new weight room for the school or a state-of-the-art telescope for the science department. A similar project could involve the outside local community as well.\\r\\nIn Latin America except in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay and Uruguay there is no grade 12; secondary education terminates with the 11th grade.\\r\\nMexico's 12th grade is called \\"tercero de preparatoria\\" (3rd grade of preparatory school), or 5th & 6th semesters.\\r\\nPanama's 12th grade is called \\"Senior Year\\" which is also 11th grade.\\r\\nIn Chile the 12th grade is called 4to (cuarto) medio, meaning \\"fourth secondary\\".[13]\\r\\nDominican Republic's 12th grade is called \\"cuarto de bachillerato\\" or \\"doceavo\\".\\r\\nIn Guatemala is called \\"quinto de bachillerato\\".\\r\\nIn Argentina it is called quinto a?o, sexto a?o or tercero polimodal (Provinces have different curriculums). Students usually rent a saloon and organize a dinner and a party for themselves, their friends and families.

The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crime-fighter. Spider-Man's creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices of his own invention, which he calls \\"web-shooters\\", and react to danger quickly with his \\"spider-sense\\", enabling him to combat his foes.\\r\\nWhen Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, the high school student from Queens behind Spider-Man's secret identity and with whose \\"self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness\\" young readers could relate.[8] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that \\"with great power there must also come great responsibility\\"a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben.\\r\\nMarvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is titled The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character has developed from shy, nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2010s, he joins the Avengers, Marvel's flagship superhero team. Spider-Man's nemesis Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012ÿ2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die.[9] Separately, Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death. Miles is later brought into mainstream continuity, where he works alongside Peter.\\r\\nSpider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes.[10] As Marvel's flagship character and company mascot, he has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated and live action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and in a series of films. The character was first portrayed in live action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a The Electric Company skit which ran from 1974 to 1977.[11] In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire (2002ÿ2007), Andrew Garfield (2012ÿ2014),[12] and Tom Holland, who has portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2016. Reeve Carney starred as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.[13] Spider-Man has been well received as a superhero and comic book character, and he is often ranked as one of the most popular comic book characters of all time, alongside DC Comics' most famous superheroes, Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.[15]:1 In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider (see also The Spider's Web and The Spider Returns) as a great influence,[14]:130 and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a walladding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.[note 1] Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with \\"boy\\", Lee says he chose \\"Spider-Man\\" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and moreover felt the name \\"Spider-Boy\\" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes.[16] At that time Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character's approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections.[note 2] Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for that single issue, #15 (cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962).[17] In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be cancelled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man.[16] While this was indeed the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that \\"The Spiderman [sic] ... will appear every month in Amazing.\\"[17][18]\\r\\nRegardless, Lee received Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the \\"ordinary teen\\" concept, and approached artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby \\"immediately sat down for a story conference\\", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages.[19] Steve Ditko would be the inker.[note 3] When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, \\"I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badlyit just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic\\".[19]:12 Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:\\r\\nOne of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character....[20]\\r\\nAlthough the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked.[17] As Lee explained in 2010, \\"I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack's covers.\\"[21]\\r\\nIn an early recollection of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): \\"Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal.\\"[22] At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was \\"almost nil\\", he and Ditko had \\"worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands.\\"[19]:14\\r\\nKirby disputed Lee's version of the story, and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character's creation. According to Kirby, the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and Joe Simon, who in the 1950s had developed a character called the Silver Spider for the Crestwood Publications comic Black Magic, who was subsequently not used.[note 4] Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed Kirby's account, asserting that Black Magic was not a factor, and that he (Simon) devised the name \\"Spider-Man\\" (later changed to \\"The Silver Spider\\"), while Kirby outlined the character's story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby's character conception became the basis for Simon's Archie Comics superhero the Fly.[23] Artist Steve Ditko stated that Lee liked the name Hawkman from DC Comics, and that \\"Spider-Man\\" was an outgrowth of that interest.[20]\\r\\nSimon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character but disliked the resultsin Simon's description, \\"Captain America with cobwebs\\".[note 5] Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee's reasoning that Kirby's character was too heroic seems unlikelyKirby still drew the covers for Amazing Fantasy #15 and the first issue of The Amazing Spider-Man. Evanier also disputes Kirby's given reason that he was \\"too busy\\" to draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties since Kirby was, said Evanier, \\"always busy\\".[24]:127 Neither Lee's nor Kirby's explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man as drawn and envisioned by Kirby was too similar to the Fly.[24]:127\\r\\nAuthor and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. Ditko recalled that, \\"Stan called Jack about the Fly\\", adding that \\"[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis\\". It was at this point that the nature of the strip changed. \\"Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained\\". Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as \\"the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series\\". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko states, \\"I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man\\".[25] Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who \\"got Spider-Man to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did\\".[26] Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, has acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, \\"If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [it]\\".[27] He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to the character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character.[16] Writer Al Nickerson believes \\"that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created the Spider-Man that we are familiar with today [but that] ultimately, Spider-Man came into existence, and prospered, through the efforts of not just one or two, but many, comic book creators\\".[28]\\r\\nA few months after Spider-Man's introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics.[29]:97 A solo ongoing series followed, beginning with The Amazing Spider-Man #1 (cover-dated March 1963). The title eventually became Marvel's top-selling series[8]:211 with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon; a 1965 Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was \\"beset by woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us.\\"[8]:223 Following Ditko's departure after issue #38 (July 1966), John Romita, Sr. replaced him as penciler and would draw the series for the next several years. In 1968, Romita would also draw the character's extra-length stories in the comics magazine The Spectacular Spider-Man, a proto-graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers. It only lasted for two issues, but it represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series' summer annuals that began in 1964.[30]\\r\\nAn early 1970s Spider-Man story led to the revision of the Comics Code. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction of the use of illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration's Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's top-selling titles.[8]:239 Lee chose the top-selling The Amazing Spider-Man; issues #96ÿ98 (MayÿJuly 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats the Green Goblin, by revealing Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut and the Code was subsequently revised.[8]:239\\r\\nIn 1972, a second monthly ongoing series starring Spider-Man began: Marvel Team-Up, in which Spider-Man was paired with other superheroes and villains.[31] From that point on there have generally been at least two ongoing Spider-Man series at any time. In 1976, his second solo series, Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man began running parallel to the main series.[32] A third series featuring Spider-Man, Web of Spider-Man, launched in 1985 to replace Marvel Team-Up.[33] The launch of a fourth monthly title in 1990, the \\"adjectiveless\\" Spider-Man (with the storyline \\"Torment\\"), written and drawn by popular artist Todd McFarlane, debuted with several different covers, all with the same interior content. The various versions combined sold over 3 million copies, an industry record at the time. Several limited series, one-shots, and loosely related comics have also been published, and Spider-Man makes frequent cameos and guest appearances in other comic series.[32][34] In 1996 The Sensational Spider-Man was created to replace Web of Spider-Man.[35]\\r\\nIn 1998 writer-artist John Byrne revamped the origin of Spider-Man in the 13-issue limited series Spider-Man: Chapter One (December 1998 ÿ October 1999), similar to Byrne's adding details and some revisions to Superman's origin in DC Comics' The Man of Steel.[36] At the same time the original The Amazing Spider-Man was ended with issue #441 (November 1998), and The Amazing Spider-Man was restarted with vol. 2, #1 (January 1999).[37] In 2003 Marvel reintroduced the original numbering for The Amazing Spider-Man and what would have been vol. 2, #59 became issue #500 (December 2003).[37]\\r\\nWhen primary series The Amazing Spider-Man reached issue #545 (December 2007), Marvel dropped its spin-off ongoing series and instead began publishing The Amazing Spider-Man three times monthly, beginning with #546ÿ548 (all January 2008).[38] The three times monthly scheduling of The Amazing Spider-Man lasted until November 2010 when the comic book was increased from 22 pages to 30 pages each issue and published only twice a month, beginning with #648ÿ649 (both November 2010).[39][40] The following year, Marvel launched Avenging Spider-Man as the first spinoff ongoing series in addition to the still twice monthly The Amazing Spider-Man since the previous ones were cancelled at the end of 2007.[38] The Amazing series temporarily ended with issue #700 in December 2012, and was replaced by The Superior Spider-Man, which had Doctor Octopus serve as the new Spider-Man, having taken over Peter Parker's body. Superior was an enormous commercial success for Marvel,[41] and ran for 31-issue before the real Peter Parker returned in a newly relaunched The Amazing Spider-Man #1 in April 2014.[42]\\r\\nIn Forest Hills, Queens, New York,[43] Midtown High School student Peter Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. As depicted in Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962), he is bitten by a radioactive spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit and \\"acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid\\".[44] Along with super strength, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his native knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as \\"Spider-Man\\", becomes a novelty television star. However, \\"He blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief, [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben.\\" Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story's next-to-last caption, \\"With great power there must also comegreat responsibility!\\"[45]\\r\\nDespite his superpowers, Parker struggles to help his widowed aunt pay rent, is taunted by his peersparticularly football star Flash Thompsonand, as Spider-Man, engenders the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson.[46][47] As he battles his enemies for the first time,[48] Parker finds juggling his personal life and costumed adventures difficult. In time, Peter graduates from high school,[49] and enrolls at Empire State University (a fictional institution evoking the real-life Columbia University and New York University),[50] where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn, and girlfriend Gwen Stacy,[51] and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson.[48][52][53] As Peter deals with Harry's drug problems, and Harry's father is revealed to be Spider-Man's nemesis the Green Goblin, Peter even attempts to give up his costumed identity for a while.[54][55] Gwen Stacy's father, New York City Police detective captain George Stacy is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus (#90, November 1970).[56]\\r\\nIn issue #121 (June 1973),[48] the Green Goblin throws Gwen Stacy from a tower of either the Brooklyn Bridge (as depicted in the art) or the George Washington Bridge (as given in the text).[57][58] She dies during Spider-Man's rescue attempt; a note on the letters page of issue #125 states: \\"It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her.\\"[59] The following issue, the Goblin appears to kill himself accidentally in the ensuing battle with Spider-Man.[60]\\r\\nWorking through his grief, Parker eventually develops tentative feelings toward Watson, and the two \\"become confidants rather than lovers\\".[61] A romantic relationship eventually develops, with Parker proposing to her in issue #182 (July 1978), and being turned down an issue later.[62] Parker went on to graduate from college in issue #185,[48] and becomes involved with the shy Debra Whitman and the extroverted, flirtatious costumed thief Felicia Hardy, the Black Cat,[63] whom he meets in issue #194 (July 1979).[48]\\r\\nFrom 1984 to 1988, Spider-Man wore a black costume with a white spider design on his chest. The new costume originated in the Secret Wars limited series, on an alien planet where Spider-Man participates in a battle between Earth's major superheroes and villains.[64] He continues wearing the costume when he returns, starting in The Amazing Spider-Man #252. The change to a longstanding character's design met with controversy, \\"with many hardcore comics fans decrying it as tantamount to sacrilege. Spider-Man's traditional red and blue costume was iconic, they argued, on par with those of his D.C. rivals Superman and Batman.\\"[65] The creators then revealed the costume was an alien symbiote which Spider-Man is able to reject after a difficult struggle,[66] though the symbiote returns several times as Venom for revenge.[48]\\r\\nParker proposes to Watson a second time in The Amazing Spider-Man #290 (July 1987), and she accepts two issues later, with the wedding taking place in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21 (1987). It was promoted with a real-life mock wedding using models, including Tara Shannon as Watson,[67] with Stan Lee officiating at the June 5, 1987, event at Shea Stadium.[68][69] However, David Michelinie, who scripted based on a plot by editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, said in 2007, \\"I didn't think they actually should [have gotten] married. ... I had actually planned another version, one that wasn't used.\\"[68]\\r\\nIn a controversial storyline, Peter becomes convinced that Ben Reilly, the Scarlet Spider (a clone of Peter created by his college professor Miles Warren) is the real Peter Parker, and that he, Peter, is the clone. Peter gives up the Spider-Man identity to Reilly for a time, until Reilly is killed by the returning Green Goblin and revealed to be the clone after all.[70] In stories published in 2005 and 2006 (such as \\"The Other\\"), he develops additional spider-like abilities including biological web-shooters, toxic stingers that extend from his forearms, the ability to stick individuals to his back, enhanced Spider-sense and night vision, and increased strength and speed. Peter later becomes a member of the New Avengers, and reveals his civilian identity to the world,[71] increasing his already numerous problems. His marriage to Mary Jane and public unmasking are later erased in another controversial[72] storyline \\"One More Day\\", in a Faustian bargain with the demon Mephisto that results in several other adjustments to the timeline, including the resurrection of Harry Osborn and the return of Spider-Man's traditional tools and powers.[73]\\r\\nThat storyline came at the behest of editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, who said, \\"Peter being single is an intrinsic part of the very foundation of the world of Spider-Man\\".[72] It caused unusual public friction between Quesada and writer J. Michael Straczynski, who \\"told Joe that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the [story] arc\\" but was talked out of doing so.[74] At issue with Straczynski's climax to the arc, Quesada said, was\\r\\n...that we didn't receive the story and methodology to the resolution that we were all expecting. What made that very problematic is that we had four writers and artists well underway on [the sequel arc] \\"Brand New Day\\" that were expecting and needed \\"One More Day\\" to end in the way that we had all agreed it would. ... The fact that we had to ask for the story to move back to its original intent understandably made Joe upset and caused some major delays and page increases in the series. Also, the science that Joe was going to apply to the retcon of the marriage would have made over 30 years of Spider-Man books worthless, because they never would have had happened. ...[I]t would have reset way too many things outside of the Spider-Man titles. We just couldn't go there....[74]\\r\\nFollowing the \\"reboot\\", Parker's identity was no longer known to the general public; however, he revealed it to other superheroes.[75] and others have deduced it. Parker's Aunt May marries J. Jonah Jameson's father, Jay Jameson.[76] Parker became an employee of the think-tank Horizon Labs.[77] In issue #700, the dying supervillain Doctor Octopus swaps bodies with Parker, who remains as a presence in Doctor Octopus's mind,[78] prompting a two-year storyline in the series The Superior Spider-Man in which Peter Parker is absent and Doctor Octopus is Spider-Man. Peter eventually regains control of his body.[79] Following Peter Parker's return, The Amazing Spider-Man was relaunched in April 2014, with Peter Parker becoming a billionaire after the formation of Parker Industries.[80][81] In December 2014, following the Death of Wolverine comic book, Spider-Man became the new headmaster of the Jean Grey School and began appearing more prominently in X-Men stories, taking Wolverine's role in the comic Wolverine and the X-Men.[82]\\r\\nAs one contemporaneous journalist observed, \\"Spider-Man has a terrible identity problem, a marked inferiority complex, and a fear of women. He is anti-social,  [sic] castration-ridden, racked with Oedipal guilt, and accident-prone ... [a] functioning neurotic\\".[43] Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right, he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal.[84]\\r\\nNotes cultural historian Bradford W. Wright,\\r\\nSpider-Man's plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect. In the first issue of The Amazing Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the Daily Bugle, launches an editorial campaign against the \\"Spider-Man menace.\\" The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider-Man and makes it impossible for him to earn any more money by performing. Eventually, the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw. Ironically, Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson's Daily Bugle.[8]:212\\r\\nThe mid-1960s stories reflected the political tensions of the time, as early 1960s Marvel stories had often dealt with the Cold War and Communism.[8]:220ÿ223 As Wright observes,\\r\\nFrom his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people. Fittingly, then, his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people. In 1968, in the wake of actual militant student demonstrations at Columbia University, Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University.... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives.[8]:234ÿ235\\r\\nA bite from a radioactive spider triggers mutations in Peter Parker's body, granting him superpowers.[85] In the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has the ability to cling to walls, superhuman strength, a sixth sense (\\"spider-sense\\") that alerts him to danger, perfect balance and equilibrium, as well as superhuman speed and agility.[85] The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, but later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level.[86] Academically brilliant, Parker has expertise in the fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics. With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters.[85] This mechanism ejects an advanced adhesive, releasing web-fluid in a variety of configurations, including a single rope-like strand to swing from, a net to snare or bind enemies, and a simple glob to foul machinery or blind an opponent. He can also weave the web material into simple forms like a shield, a spherical protection or hemispherical barrier, a club, or a hang-glider wing. Other equipment include a light beacon that can either be used as a flashlight or project a \\"Spider-Signal\\" design, a specially modified camera that can take pictures automatically, and spider-tracers, which are spider-shaped adhesive homing beacons keyed to his own spider-sense.\\r\\nDue to Spider-Man's popularity in the mainstream Marvel Universe, publishers have been able to introduce different variations of Spider-Man outside of mainstream comics as well as reimagined stories in many other multiversed spinoffs such as Ultimate Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099, and Spider-Man: India. Marvel has also made its own parodies of Spider-Man in comics such as Not Brand Echh, which was published in the late 1960s and featured such characters as Peter Pooper alias Spidey-Man,[87] and Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham, who appeared in the 1980s. The fictional character has inspired a number of deratives such as a manga version of Spider-Man drawn by Japanese artist Ryoichi Ikegami as well as Hideshi Hino's The Bug Boy, which has been cited as inspired by Spider-Man.[88] Also the French comic Tl-Junior, which published strips based on popular TV series, produced original Spider-Man adventures in the late 1970s; artists included Grald Forton, who later moved to America and worked for Marvel.[89]\\r\\nSpider-Man has had a large range of supporting characters introduced in the comics that are essential in the issues and storylines that star him. After his parents died, Peter Parker was raised by his loving aunt, May Parker, and his uncle and father figure, Ben Parker. After Uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar, Aunt May is virtually Peter's only family, and she and Peter are very close.[44]\\r\\nJ. Jonah Jameson is depicted as the publisher of the Daily Bugle and is Peter Parker's boss and as a harsh critic of Spider-Man, always saying negative things about the superhero in the newspaper. Despite his role as Jameson's publishing editor and confidant Robbie Robertson is always depicted as a supporter of both Peter Parker and Spider-Man.[46]\\r\\nEugene \\"Flash\\" Thompson is commonly depicted as Parker's high school tormentor and bully, but in later comic issues he becomes a friend to Peter.[46] Meanwhile, Harry Osborn, son of Norman Osborn, is most commonly recognized as Peter's best friend but has also been depicted sometimes as his rival in the comics.[48]\\r\\nPeter Parker's romantic interests range between his first crush, the fellow high-school student Liz Allan,[46] to having his first date with Betty Brant,[90] the secretary to the Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson. After his breakup with Betty Brant, Parker eventually falls in love with his college girlfriend Gwen Stacy,[48][51] daughter of New York City Police Department detective captain George Stacy, both of whom are later killed by supervillain enemies of Spider-Man.[56] Mary Jane Watson eventually became Peter's best friend and then his wife.[68] Felicia Hardy, the Black Cat, is a reformed cat burglar who had been Spider-Man's sole superhuman girlfriend and partner at one point.[63]\\r\\nWriters and artists over the years have established a rogues gallery of supervillains to face Spider-Man. In comics and in other media. As with the hero, the majority of the villains' powers originate with scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology, and many have animal-themed costumes or powers.[note 6] Examples are listed down below in the ordering of their original chronological appearance: ????

Spider-Man is cited to have more than one archenemy and it can be debated or disputed as to which one is worse:[142]\\r\\nIn The Creation of Spider-Man, comic book writer-editor and historian Paul Kupperberg calls the character's superpowers \\"nothing too original\\"; what was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a \\"nerdy high school student\\".[151]:5 Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man included \\"heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of melodrama\\". Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics: \\"the flawed superhero with everyday problems\\". This idea spawned a \\"comics revolution\\".[151]:6 The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel's early 1960s comic books such as The Amazing Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, and X-Men ushered in a new type of superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the public's perception of them.[152] Spider-Man has become one of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world, and has been used to sell toys, games, cereal, candy, soap, and many other products.[153]\\r\\nSpider-Man has become Marvel's flagship character, and has often been used as the company mascot. When Marvel became the first comic book company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991, the Wall Street Journal announced \\"Spider-Man is coming to Wall Street\\"; the event was in turn promoted with an actor in a Spider-Man costume accompanying Stan Lee to the Stock Exchange.[8]:254 Since 1962, hundreds of millions of comics featuring the character have been sold around the world.[154] Spider-Man is the world's most profitable superhero.[155] In 2014, global retail sales of licensed products related to Spider-Man reached approximately $1.3 billion.[156] Comparatively, this amount exceeds the global licensing revenue of Batman, Superman, and the Avengers combined.[155]\\r\\nSpider-Man joined the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1987 to 1998 as one of the balloon floats,[157] designed by John Romita Sr.,[158] one of the character's signature artists.

IGN noted that despite being one of the most tragic superheroes of all time that he is \\"one of the most fun and snarky superheroes in existence.\\"[167] Empire noted and praised that despite the many tragedies that Spider-Man faces that he retains his sense of humour at all times with his witty wisecracks.

Riverside is the county seat of the eponymous county and named for its location beside the Santa Ana River.[10] It is the most populous city in the Inland Empire and in Riverside County, and is located about 60 miles (97?km) east of Los Angeles. It is also part of the Greater Los Angeles area. Riverside is the 59th most populous city in the United States and 12th most populous city in California. As of the 2010 Census, Riverside had a population of 303,871.\\r\\nRiverside was founded in the early 1870s. It is the birthplace of the California citrus industry and home of the Mission Inn, the largest Mission Revival Style building in the United States.[11] It is also home to the Riverside National Cemetery.\\r\\nThe University of California, Riverside, is located in the northeastern part of the city. The university also hosts the Riverside Sports Complex. Other attractions in Riverside include the Fox Performing Arts Center, Riverside Metropolitan Museum, which houses exhibits and artifacts of local history, the California Museum of Photography, the California Citrus State Historic Park, and the Parent Washington Navel Orange Tree, the last of the two original navel orange trees in California.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1700s and early 1800s the area was inhabited by Cahuilla and the Serrano people. Californios such as Bernardo Yorba and Juan Bandini established ranches during the first half of the 19th century. In the 1860s, Louis Prevost launched the California Silk Center Association, a short-lived experiment in sericulture. In the wake of its failure, John W. North purchased some of its land and formed the Southern California Colony Association to promote the area's development. In March 1870, North distributed posters announcing the formation of a colony in California.[13] North, a staunch temperance-minded abolitionist from New York State, had formerly founded Northfield, Minnesota. A few years later, some navel orange trees were planted and found to be such a success that full-scale planting began. Riverside was temperance minded, and Republican. There were four saloons in Riverside when it was founded. The license fees were raised until the saloons moved out of Riverside.[14] Investors from England and Canada transplanted traditions and activities adopted by prosperous citizens. As a result, the first golf course and polo field in southern California were built in Riverside.\\r\\nThe first orange trees were planted in 1871, with the citrus industry Riverside is famous for beginning three years later (1874)[15] when Eliza Tibbetts received three [15] Brazilian navel orange trees sent to her by a personal friend, William Saunders who was a horticulturist at the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. The trees came from Bahia, Brazil. The Bahia orange did not thrive in Florida, but its success in southern California was phenomenal.\\r\\nThe three trees were planted on the Tibbetts' property. One of them died after it was trampled by a cow during the first year it was planted. After the trampling, the two remaining trees were transplanted to property belonging to Sam McCoy to receive better care than L. C. Tibbetts, Eliza's husband, could provide.[16] Later, the trees were again transplanted, one at the Mission Inn property in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt (this tree died in 1922), and the other was placed at the intersection of Magnolia and Arlington Ave. Eliza Tibbetts was honored with a stone marker placed with the tree. That tree still stands to this day inside a protective fence abutting what is now a major intersection.\\r\\nThe trees thrived in the southern California climate and the navel orange industry grew rapidly. Many growers purchased bud wood and then grafted the cuttings to root stock. Within a few years, the successful cultivation of many thousands of the newly discovered Brazilian navel orange led to a California Gold Rush of a different kind: the establishment of the citrus industry, which is commemorated in the landscapes and exhibits of the California Citrus State Historic Park and the restored packing houses in the downtown's Marketplace district. By 1882, there were more than half a million citrus trees in California, almost half of which were in Riverside. The development of refrigerated railroad cars and innovative irrigation systems established Riverside as the richest city in the United States (in terms of income per capita) by 1895.[17]\\r\\nAs the city prospered, a small guest hotel designed in the popular Mission Revival style, known as the Glenwood Tavern, eventually grew to become the Mission Inn, which was favored by presidents, royalty and movie stars. Inside was housed a special chair made for the sizable President William Howard Taft. The hotel was modeled after the missions left along the California coast by Franciscan friars in the 18th and 19th centuries. (Although Spanish missionaries came as far inland as San Bernardino (San Bernardino de Sena Estancia), east of Riverside, there was no actual Spanish mission in what is now Riverside.) Postcards of lush orange groves, swimming pools and magnificent homes have attracted vacationers and entrepreneurs throughout the years. Many relocated to the warm, dry climate for reasons of health and to escape Eastern winters. Victoria Avenue, with its scattering of elegant turn-of-the-century homes, and citrus-lined paseo, serves as a reminder of European investors who settled here.\\r\\nRiverside is the 59th largest city in the United States, 12th largest city in California, and the largest city in California's Inland Empire metro area. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 81.4 square miles (210.8?km2), of which 81.1 square miles (210?km2) is land and 0.3 square miles (0.78?km2) (0.37%) is water. The elevation of downtown Riverside is 860 feet (260?m). Hills within the city limits include Mount Rubidoux, a city landmark and tourist attraction. Riverside is surrounded by small and large mountains, some of which get a dusting of winter snow. Many residents also enjoy the many beaches of southern California. Riverside is about a 47-mile drive to the Pacific Ocean and is close to Orange county and Los Angeles county .[18]\\r\\nRiverside is home to the historic Mission Inn, the Beaux-Arts style Riverside County Historic Courthouse (based on the Petit Palais in Paris, France), and the Riverside Fox Theater, where the first showing of the 1939 film Gone with the Wind took place. The theater was purchased by the city and refurbished as part of the Riverside Renaissance Initiative.[19] The Fox Theater underwent extensive renovation and restoration, which was completed in 2009, to turn the old cinema into a performing arts theater.[20] The building was expanded to hold 1,600 seats and the stage was enlarged to accommodate Broadway-style performances. In January 2010, singer Sheryl Crow opened the newly remodeled Fox Theater in a nearly sold-out show.[21]\\r\\nRiverside is the home of the \\"World's Largest Paper Cup\\" (actually made of concrete), which is over three stories (68.10?ft) tall. The \\"Dixie Cup\\" landmark is located on Iowa Street just north of Palmyrita, in front of what was once the Dixie Corporation's manufacturing plant (now closed down).\\r\\nThree notable hills are in Riverside's scenic landscape: Box Springs Mountain, Evans (Jurupa) Hill and Tecolote Hill; all of which are preserved open spaces. South of Riverside is Lake Mathews. There is also the well-known landmark/foothill, Mount Rubidoux, which is next to the Santa Ana River and one of the most noticeable landmarks in the downtown area. This foothill is the dividing line between the town of Rubidoux and the city of Riverside.\\r\\nMarch Joint Air Reserve Base borders Riverside on the east serving as a divider between the city and Moreno Valley. March ARB is the oldest operating Air Force base west of the Mississippi River, having been founded in 1918.\\r\\nAt the entrance to Riverside from the 60 freeway sits Fairmount Park. This extensive urban oasis was designed by the firm founded by Frederick Law Olmsted, which had designed New York's Central Park.[22] A lovely stocked pond that is home to many species of birds. On nearby private land is the former site of Spring Rancheria, a Cahuilla village.\\r\\nThe city of Riverside has 28 designated \\"neighborhoods\\" within the city limits.[23] These neighborhoods include Airport, Alessandro Heights, Arlanza, Arlington, Arlington Heights, Arlington South, Canyon Crest, Casa Blanca, Downtown, Eastside, Grand, Hawarden Hills, Hillside Hunter Industrial Park, La Sierra, La Sierra Acres, La Sierra Hills, La Sierra South, Magnolia Center, Mission Grove, Northside, Orangecrest, Presidential Park, Ramona, Sycamore Canyon Park, Sycamore Canyon Springs, University, Victoria and Wood Streets.\\r\\nTo the east of downtown is the originally named \\"Eastside,\\" which grew out of a colonia inhabited by Mexican immigrant workers in the orange groves, other orchards and produce fields. The area these people lived in was originally a settlement called La Placita that predated the city being founded in 1843. Mexican communities were also formed in the barrio of Casa Blanca during the early twentieth century.\\r\\nThe City Council has proposed many annexations of nearby unincorporated communities which will increase its population and land area over the next few years. Most notable is the Lake Hills/Victoria Grove area, which would extend its southwestern borders to Lake Mathews.[24]\\r\\nRiverside is home to the University of California, Riverside. The UCR Botanical Gardens contains 40 acres (16?ha) of unusual plants, with four miles (6?km) of walking trails. The city prides itself on its historic connection to the navel orange, which was introduced to North America from Brazil by the first settlers to Riverside in 1873. Riverside is home to the one surviving Parent Navel Orange Tree, from which all American West Coast navel orange trees are descended.\\r\\nThere are three hospitals in Riverside.[25]\\r\\nRiverside is also home to the Riverside Public Library system. Branches include: Arlanza, Arlington, La Sierra, Marcy, Main, Orange Terrace, Eastside Cybrary, and Casa Blanca.\\r\\nConvention facilities are available at several locations. The Riverside Convention Center, remodeled in 2014, offers 66,000?sq?ft (6,100?m2) indoors and 14,000?sq?ft (1,300?m2) outdoor space. Also available is the Riverside Marriott with 14,000?sq?ft (1,300?m2) indoors, and the Mission Inn with 15,000?sq?ft (1,400?m2) indoors and 5,000?sq?ft (460?m2) outdoors.[26] All three facilities are located within walking distance of each other in downtown Riverside. Meetings with an academic focus are also held at the University of California, Riverside.\\r\\nCemeteries in Riverside include:\\r\\nRiverside experiences a semi-arid (K?ppen climate classification BSh) climate with hot, dry summers and mild, relatively wet winters. Normal monthly mean temperatures range from 54.5?F (12.5?C) in December to 79.4?F (26.3?C) in August.[32] On average, temperatures reach the freezing mark and 100?F (38?C) on 2.5 and 14.6?days annually, respectively.[32] Record temperatures range from 18?F (?8?C) on January 15, 1911, up to 118?F (48?C) on July 17, 1925 and June 16, 1917.[33] On average, Riverside receives 10.33?in (262?mm) of precipitation annually, with measurable precipitation occurring on 30?days, with most of it occurring in the winter and early spring, especially January through March, with February the wettest month.[34]\\r\\nThe Riverside area is referred to as a \\"smog belt\\" because of its above-average level of air pollution. In a comparison by the National Campaign Against Dirty Air Power (2003), the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario area was found to be one of the most polluted regions based on year-round particle measurements when compared to other U.S. cities.[35] [NEJM 2004;351:1057-1067] Due to the smog problems, the city has made efforts to reduce pollution by incorporating additional means of mass transit (Metrolink) and equipping its entire fleet of buses with natural gas. Smog decreased considerably over the next few years as local municipalities and counties worked with the South Coast Air Quality Management District to implement measures to improve regional air quality.[36] The smog alerts that people remember from decades ago are history.[37] Most of Riverside's smog problems are the result of the prevailing wind patterns that blow the smog from the Los Angeles Basin and particulates generated by southern California's multitude of vehicles, and the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach into the Inland Empire.\\r\\nAs of the 2010 census[43] reported that Riverside had a population of 303,871.

It became the organizational backbone of the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, collected and published data about \\"unreached people\\" and also published the \\"Mission Handbook: North American Protestant Ministries Overseas\\".[12]\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, World Vision began training families to build small farms by teaching agricultural skills aiming to make lasting effects in the communities they were helping by promoting self-reliance[13] The organization also began installing water pumps for clean water in communities which caused infant mortality rates to drop. Volunteers now use the fresh water to teach communities gardening and irrigation and promote good health.[13]\\r\\nDuring the 1990s, World Vision International began focusing on the needs of children who had been orphaned in Uganda, Romania, and Somalia in response to AIDS, neglect, and civil war, respectively. They began educating other African communities on AIDS after realizing its impact. They also joined the United Nations peacekeeping efforts to help those affected by civil war. World Vision also started to openly promote the international ban on land mines.[13] In 1994 World Vision US moved to Washington State.[14]\\r\\nAccording to Forbes magazine, as of December 2014, World Vision is the 11th largest charity in the United States with total revenue of over 981 million dollars.[15]\\r\\nWorld Vision Partnership now operates as a federation of interdependent national offices governed by the same agreement but with three different levels of central control.\\r\\nThe Covenant of Partnership is a document that all national members of the World Vision Partnership have to sign.

However, World Vision also respects other religions that they encounter, stating that \\"to promote a secular approach to life would be an insult to them\\".[21] Richard Stearns, president of World Vision US, stated that World Vision has a strict policy against proselytizing, which he describes as \\"...using any kind of coercion or inducement to listen to a religious message before helping someone\\".[22]\\r\\nThe World Vision Partnership and all its national members are committed to the concept of transformational development,[23] which is cast in a biblical framework and in which evangelization is an integral part of development work.[24]\\r\\nActivities include: emergency relief, education, health care, economic development, and promotion of justice. The organization has consultative status with UNESCO and partnerships with UN agencies like UNICEF, WHO, UNHCR and ILO, and financial records reveal that it has funded evangelical activities all over the world.[25]\\r\\nIts approach to aid is to first help people and their communities recognize the resources that lie within them.

Furthermore, she mentions the phrase \\"serving as a witness to the gospel of Jesus Christ\\" as part of World Vision's description of its mission and identifies the word \\"witness\\" as an evangelical code word for seeking converts.[48]\\r\\nIn 1982, after World Vision publicly criticized Israel actions in Palestinian refugee camps near Sidon and Tyre, it came under attack from conservative evangelicals and the government of Israel.

WV had \\"suspended its dealings\\" with UAWC until the outcome of the investigation.[52][53] WV resumed working with UAWC after AusAID and World Vision found the allegations were unfounded.[54] The Israel Law Center considers World Vision's response to be a whitewash and maintains that the allegations have not been refuted.[55]\\r\\nOn 15 June 2016, Mohammad El Halabi, manager of World Vision in Gaza, was arrested at the Erez border crossing and charged by Israeli prosecutors with channeling its funds directly to Hamas, a listed terror organization.[56] A senior official with Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, stated that Halabi was recruited by the military wing of Hamas in 2004 and instructed to penetrate World Vision.[56][57][58] According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Halabi transferred cash to Hamas to help it in digging military tunnels and purchasing weapons.[58] Muhammad Mahmoud, Halabi's lawyer, told Haaretz that his client has nothing to do with Hamas and that the fact that the investigation had lasted 55 days proves that there is a problem with evidence.[58] Israels Shin Bet intelligence agency claims that about $48 million of World Vision resources were funneled to Hamas in just six years and another $80,000 was used for building a Hamas position in Beit Hanon and for paying salaries of Hamas members who fought against Israel in the 2014 war. World Vision confirmed that its funds are spent in accordance with legal requirements that contribute to peace and that the charity works closely with the UN and Red Cross.[59] The charity initially defended Halabi as a humanitarian.[60]\\r\\nIn August 2016, Israeli officials claimed that the World Vision organization was providing the military wing of Hamas with tens of millions of dollars in Gaza. World Vision has denounced these allegations which come amid Israeli campaigns against the non-governmental organizations that worked with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade immediately suspended all funding of Palestinian programs by World Vision.[61] World Vision Australia chief executive, Tim Costello, accepted this move as being the correct thing to do pending a proper investigation of the allegations.[62][63] An review of the Australian government came to the conclusion that no Australian taxpayer money was diverted to Hamas.[64]","input":"When was world vision founded and by whom?"},{"output":"Andrew Holness","context":"Sir William Bustamante\\r\\nThe Prime Minister of Jamaica is Jamaica's head of government, currently Andrew Holness.

He is regarded as one of the greatest ice hockey players of the modern NHL. Prior to entering the league, Ovechkin played for HC Dynamo Moscow of the Russian Superleague for four seasons, from 2001 until 2005, and returned to play for them briefly during the 2012ÿ13 NHL lockout. A highly touted prospect, Ovechkin was selected by the Capitals first overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. With the 2004ÿ05 NHL lockout cancelling the season, Ovechkin remained in Russia until 2005, joining the Capitals for the 2005ÿ06 season.

That year he also led the league in points, winning the Art Ross Trophy, and also won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player and Lester B. Pearson Award as the best player as voted on by the NHL Players' Association. Ovechkin would again win the Hart Trophy and Pearson Award in 2009, along with the Richard Trophy, and won the Ted Lindsay Award (the renamed Pearson Award) for a third consecutive year in 2010; it also marked the fifth straight year that he was named to the First All-Star Team.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a couple years of decreased scoring, Ovechkin again led the league in goals, earning the Richard Trophy, in 2013, and again winning the Hart Trophy.

Rick Dudley, the general manager of the Panthers, claimed the pick was legitimate, claiming that Ovechkin was old enough with leap years taken into consideration.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the 2004ÿ05 NHL lockout, Ovechkin remained with Dynamo for one more season.

Working without an agent, Ovechkin negotiated with Capitals owner Ted Leonsis and former general manager George McPhee.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the season, on 3 March 2008,[19] Ovechkin notched his 50th, 51st and 52nd goals of the campaign for his fourth career NHL hat trick and to hit the 50-goal mark for the second time in his career. Later that month, on 21 March, Ovechkin scored his 59th and 60th goals of the season against the Atlanta Thrashers, becoming the first NHL player to score 60 goals in a season since Mario Lemieux and Jaromr Jgr in 1995ÿ96[20] and 19th player overall.[21] Four days later, on 25 March, Ovechkin scored his 61st goal of the season to break the Washington Capitals' team record for goals in a single season previously held by Dennis Maruk.[22] He also went on to break Luc Robitaille's record for most goals by a left winger in one season on 3 April, by scoring two goals for his 64th and 65th of the season.[23] He also became the first NHL player to score at least 40 even-strength goals in one season since Pavel Bure in 1999ÿ2000.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading the league in, scoring with 65 goals and 112 points, Ovechkin captured both the Art Ross Trophy and the Maurice \\"Rocket\\" Richard Trophy in 2007ÿ08. It was the first time in 41 seasons that a left-winger led the NHL in points since Bobby Hull led the league with 97 points in 1965ÿ66.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin helped lead a rejuvenated Capitals team back to the Stanley Cup playoffs with a stronger supporting cast that included countryman Alexander Semin, rookie center Nicklas B?ckstr?m and defenseman Mike Green. He scored the game-winning goal in his NHL playoff debut with less than five minutes left in Game 1 against the Philadelphia Flyers.[26] He scored nine points in seven games against the Flyers as the Capitals were eliminated in the opening round.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the off-season, Ovechkin was awarded the Lester B. Pearson Award as the top player voted by the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's MVP, becoming the first player in the history of the NHL to win all four major awards, including the Art Ross and Rocket Richard trophies.[27] Ovechkin was also awarded his third consecutive Kharlamov Trophy, named after Soviet hockey star Valeri Kharlamov and presented by Sovetsky Sport newspaper, as the best Russian NHL player as voted by other Russian NHL players.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late October of the 2008ÿ09 season, Ovechkin returned home to Moscow to visit his ailing grandfather, missing only the second game of his career up to that point, snapping a consecutive streak of 203 games played.[28] On 5 February 2009, Ovechkin scored his 200th goal, against the Los Angeles Kings, becoming only the fourth player in the NHL to reach the milestone in four seasons, joining Wayne Gretzky, Mike Bossy and Mario Lemieux.[29] On 19 March, he scored his 50th goal of the season, becoming the first Washington Capitals player to reach the 50-goal mark three times.[30] He finished the campaign with 56 goals to capture his second consecutive Rocket Richard Trophy, joining Jarome Iginla and Pavel Bure as the third player to win the award twice and the second player after Bure (2000 and 2001) to win the award in back-to-back seasons. With 110 points, he finished as runner-up to countryman Evgeni Malkin for the Art Ross.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin and the Capitals repeated as division champions en route to meeting the New York Rangers in the opening round. After advancing to the second round in seven games, Ovechkin notched his first NHL playoff hat trick on 4 May, in Game 2 against the Pittsburgh Penguins to help Washington to a 4ÿ3 win. The Capitals were eventually defeated by Pittsburgh, the eventual Stanley Cup champions, in seven games. Ovechkin finished the 2009 playoffs with a post-season career-high 21 points in 14 games. He went on to win the Hart and Pearson trophies for the second consecutive year, becoming the seventeenth player to win the Hart multiple times.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust over a month into the 2009ÿ10 season, Ovechkin suffered an upper-body injury during a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets on 1 November 2009, after a collision with opposing forward Raffi Torres.[32] After returning, Ovechkin was suspended by the NHL on 1 December for two games (one for the action, and one for a second game misconduct penalty during the season) for a knee-on-knee hit to Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Tim Gleason during a game the previous day.[33] Both Gleason and Ovechkin had to be helped off the ice, although Gleason later returned during the game, while Ovechkin did not. Ovechkin was assessed a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct at the time. Capitals Coach Bruce Boudreau commented that Ovechkin's style of play was at times \\"reckless.\\" The suspension was Ovechkin's first of his career, causing him to forfeit $98,844.16 in salary.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 January 2010, Ovechkin was named captain of the Washington Capitals after previous captain Chris Clark was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets. He became the first European, second-youngest and 14th overall captain in team history.[35] On 5 February, at a game against the New York Rangers, Ovechkin, with his second goal and third point of the game, reached the 500-point milestone of his NHL career. He is the fifth player to achieve the milestone in only five seasons, reaching it in 373 career games.[36] On 14 March, at a game against the Chicago Blackhawks at the United Center, Ovechkin sent 'Hawks defenseman Brian Campbell into the boards after Campbell had dumped the puck to the blue line. Ovechkin was called for boarding, receiving a five-minute major and a game misconduct,[37] and was suspended for two games (for a third game misconduct of the season, a two-game suspension is automatic).[38] Campbell suffered a fractured clavicle and fractured rib, and was expected to be out seven-to-eight weeks.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin won the 2009ÿ10 Ted Lindsay Award, becoming only the second player in NHL history to win the award in three consecutive years. He also led the NHL in goals per game and points per game for three straight seasons, from 2008 to 2010.[40] Ovechkin ranks third in Capitals history in goals (only Peter Bondra and Mike Gartner have tallied more goals) and is seventh in total points.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009ÿ10 Ovechkin surpassed the mark of Hall of Fame goaltender Bill Durnan (first four seasons from 1943ÿ44 through 1946ÿ47) and became the first player in NHL history voted a First Team All-Star in each of his first five seasons.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, Ovechkin and the Capitals took part in the New Year's Day NHL Winter Classic, facing the Pittsburgh Penguins. Ovechkin did not score any points, but the Capitals won 3ÿ1. On 8 March 2011, in a 5ÿ0 victory over the Edmonton Oilers, Ovechkin recorded his 600th career point. On 5 April, Ovechkin scored his 300th career goal, becoming the sixth-youngest and seventh-fastest player to do so.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 January 2012, Ovechkin received a three-game suspension for a hit on Zbynk Michlek of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The following day, Ovechkin announced he would not attend the 2012 NHL All-Star Game due to the suspension.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin's numbers dipped in the 2011 and 2012 seasons, but in the lockout-shortened 2013 season, he led the NHL in goal-scoring with 32, earning him his third Rocket Richard Trophy. He combined his 32 goals with 24 assists, giving him 56 points, good for third most points in the NHL.[44] He was also awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy for the third time in his career. Ovechkin only scored two points in a first round exit of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs against the New York Rangers, during which he played with a hairline fracture in his foot. After the 2013 season, Ovechkin made history by being named to both the First and Second NHL All-Star Teams. He had switched to playing right wing that entire season so was voted to the First All-Star Team's right wing, but because some voters were not aware of the change, voted for him at his traditional left wing position, therefore also landing him left wing on the Second All-Star Team.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 20 December 2013, in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes, Ovechkin scored his 400th career goal.[46] He became the sixth fastest player to ever reach that mark, getting it in 634 games, one less than Pavel Bure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the 2013ÿ14 season, Ovechkin had the strange distinction of winning the Rocket Richard Trophy, scoring 51 goals, while going ?35, one of the NHL's worst, in the plus-minus statistic. However, the Capitals missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006ÿ07.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 November 2014, in a game against the Calgary Flames, Ovechkin recorded his 826th point, a franchise record, surpassing Peter Bondra, who previously held the record with 825 points. However, the Flames won the game 4ÿ3 in overtime. On 31 March 2015, in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes, Ovechkin scored his 50th goal of the year and became the sixth player in NHL history to have six 50-goal seasons, joining Guy Lafleur, Mike Bossy, Wayne Gretzky, Marcel Dionne and Mario Lemieux.[47] On 2 April, Ovechkin scored his 51st and 52nd goals of the season in a 5ÿ4 shootout win against the Montreal Canadiens, surpassing Bondra as the franchise leader in goals scored. It was also his 15th multi-goal game of the season, none of which were hat-tricks.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2015ÿ16 season, in the second period of a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Ovechkin scored his eighth goal of the season to tie Sergei Fedorov's tally for the most goals among Russian born players, with 483. On 19 November 2015, Ovechkin scored his ninth goal of the season in a 3ÿ2 loss to the Dallas Stars; that goal broke Fedorov's record. On 10 January 2016, Ovechkin scored his 500th and 501st goals in a 7ÿ1 victory over the Ottawa Senators, becoming the 43rd player to reach the 500-goal plateau, and the fifth-fastest player to do so, as well as the first Russian.[49] On 9 April, Ovechkin scored his 50th goal of the season and became the third player in NHL history to have seven or more 50-goal seasons.[50][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2015ÿ16 season, Ovechkin, for the first time in his career, did not lead the Washington Capitals in points, although he still led the team in goals with 50, and finished second on the team in points with 71, behind fellow countryman Evgeny Kuznetsov, who finished with 77.[52] In the second round of the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Washington Capitals lost the series to the Pittsburgh Penguins in Game 6 after a 4ÿ3 overtime defeat.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 January 2017, Ovechkin scored his 1,000th career point, becoming the 37th player in NHL history to reach 1,000 points with only one team.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2017ÿ18 season appeared to be historic for Ovechkin, who broke many NHL and Capitals' records during the regular season. On 7 October 2017, he became the first player in 100 years with back-to-back hat-tricks to start the season.[54] As well, on 25 November, Ovechkin passed Bondra as the team's all-time leader in hat-tricks with his 20th of his career.[55] On 21 October, in a game against the Detroit Red Wings, Ovechkin surpassed Jaromr Jgr for most regular season overtime goals with the 20th of his career.[56] He extended the record again in December in an overtime win against the Anaheim Ducks.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 March 2018, Ovechkin scored his 600th career goal, making him the 20th player to ever reach such a feat, and the fourth to do so in less than 1,000 games.[58] On 1 April 2018 Ovechkin would play in his 1,000th NHL game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, becoming the first Capitals player to play 1,000 games and the 54th NHL player to do so within the same franchise.[59] At the conclusion of the regular season, Ovechkin was awarded the Rocket Richard trophy for the seventh time in his career.[60] He became the second player, tied with Bobby Hull, to win the NHL's goal scoring title seven times.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 May 2018, Ovechkin helped lead the Capitals to the Stanley Cup Finals for their first time since 1998. On June 7, he won his first Stanley Cup by defeating the Vegas Golden Knights 4-3 in Game 5. He was named MVP of the series.[62] As the \\"face of the Capitals\\" for over a decade, Ovechkin had taken \\"the lion's share of the blame\\" for the team's failing record postseason  which had included three straight exits during the second round, two of them dealt by the Pittsburgh Penguins. But, in the 2018 playoffs \\"Ovi's been on a mission,\\" according to coach Trotz. \\"There were a lot of people doubting if he still had what it took. The great players take exception to that. . . I think he took it personally. He said, 'I'm going to show you I'm still a great player.' And he did.\\"[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin was \\"in the midst of the most dominant postseason of his career,\\" with 12 goals and 22 points over 19 games, and averaging 21:14 of ice time per game.[63] Of finally breaking through to the Stanley Cup Finals, Ovechkin himself says, \\"I feel very happy, but we're not finished yet. We've been waiting for this moment a long time.\\"[64] After 13 seasons in the NHL, Ovechkin competed in his first conference finals, and played in his first Stanley Cup Final.[65] He scored the first Stanley Cup Final goal of his 13-year, 1,121-game NHL career on 30 May 2018 in Game 2 against the Vegas Golden Knights in Las Vegas.[66] The Stanley Cup victory was the first in the Capitals 44 year franchise history.\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin's capability to shoot heavily as a power forward[67][68][69] has been well documented.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"But I tell you, when you get on the ice with him and you see his shot for the first time, it's crazy. It's so, so hard. When I shoot, I can see my puck. When he shoots  Oh, come on. Where's the puck?\\"[70]\\r\\n\\"Guys like Ovi shoot it so hard that it's almost like you're a batter in baseball. You see the blur of the puck coming at you in frames.\\"[71]\\r\\n\\"When he gets to the left faceoff circle, good luck to the opposing goaltender. He still is one of the most dangerous players with the puck on the rush and in the high-slot. His one-timer is still the best in the league.\\"[72]\\r\\n\\"The truth is that we are witnessing one of the most amazing players in NHL history, even if not all of us understand that yet.\\"[73]\\r\\n\\"There are so many good players in the league you can find comparables to. Ovie is different than everybody in the league. I could find a lot of guys that are more similar to Sid. Ovie is one of a kind. I wish I could say he doesn't care about what people think about him, but I know he does. He's just not as worried about the perception. He just is who he is. He doesn't try to hide it. He just does what he does. And it's obviously worked for him.\\"[74]\\r\\nThe Capitals' morning skate ritually begins with captain Ovechkin \\"sprinting around the rink, a solo lap to the sound of sticks tapping from his teammates.\\" Once he's made it all the way around, the rest of the team jumps onto the ice to join him.[75] Ovechkin is known as a durable player, losing little time to injuries. After being struck on the foot by a teammate's wrist shot during a 2006 game in Vancouver, he \\"crumpled to the ice and had to be helped to the locker room.\\" Exhibiting no ill effects in practice the next day, Ovechkin famously told reporters, \\"I'm okay; Russian machine never breaks.\\"[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the 2008ÿ09 season, Ovechkin garnered some criticism over his exuberant after-goal celebrations. On 28 February 2009, during a segment of Hockey Night in Canada's Coach's Corner, Canadian hockey analyst Don Cherry likened Ovechkin's celebrations of jumping into the boards and his teammates to that of soccer players, concluding that this was not the Canadian way and advising Canadian kids to ignore Ovechkin's example. Capitals coach Bruce Boudreau came to Ovechkin's defense, stating Cherry \\"doesn't know Alex like we know Alex\\", and Ovechkin himself stated that he \\"doesn't care\\" about Cherry.[77] The next notable incident happened on 19 March 2009, in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. After scoring his 50th goal of the season, Ovechkin put his stick on the ice, pretending to warm his hands over it because it was \\"hot.\\" The incident sparked an immediate response from Tampa Bay coach Rick Tocchet, who said that \\"[Ovechkin] went down a notch in my books.\\" Boudreau had also stated that he would discuss the incident with Ovechkin, and teammate Mike Green, despite being the first to celebrate with Ovechkin afterwards, commented that he did not wish to join in the pre-meditated celebration.[78] Ovechkin himself was unapologetic, and said about Don Cherry in particular, \\"He's going to be pissed off for sure...I love it!.\\"[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter using and endorsing CCM equipment for most of his career, Ovechkin made the move to Bauer Hockey in August 2011  following a decline in his point production in the 2010ÿ11 season.[80] He continued to use Bauer equipment until the 2017 season, when he switched back to CCM.[81] Ovechkin currently uses the Ribcor Trigger stick and Super Tacks AS1 skates.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of 16, Ovechkin helped lead the junior national team to the gold medal with two hat tricks, one against Switzerland and one against the United States, and an assist.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of 17, when he was selected by Russian coach Viktor Tikhonov to play in the ?esk Poji??ovna Cup EuroTour tournament, Ovechkin became the youngest skater ever to play for the Russian national team. In that tournament, he also became the youngest player ever to score for the national team. He also was selected to play at the 2002 IIHF World U18 Championships, which he amassed 14 goals and four assists in eight games, leading Russia to a silver medal.[4][82] Ovechkin holds the record for most points scored in IIHF U18 World Championships with 31 points in 14 games.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of 18, Ovechkin was named captain of the junior Russian national team. Russia finished fifth in the tournament. In 2003, the team would go on to win a gold medal in the IIHF World U20 Championship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of 19, Ovechkin was named to the Russian national team for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, making him the youngest player to play in the tournament.[84][85]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso at 19, Ovechkin was named captain of the junior team in the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. The tournament, lasting from 25 December 2004, to 4 January 2005, was Ovechkin's third and last. At the conclusion of the tournament, he had collected seven goals, tied for the tournament lead. His team received the silver medal after losing the gold medal game to Canada on 4 January, and Ovechkin was named the Best Forward of the tournament as well as selected to the tournament All-Star Team.\\r\\nIn 2005, Ovechkin played in his first IIHF men's World Championships. He scored five goals and three assists, landing eighth in the top scorers list and sharing third place in goal scoring.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, Ovechkin played in his first Winter Olympic Games. Although Russia came away from the games without a medal, Ovechkin scored five goals in the tournament, including the game-winner against Canada's Martin Brodeur, eliminating Canada from the tournament. Ovechkin was the only player not on the Swedish (gold medal winners) or Finnish (silver medal winners) teams to be named to the all-tournament team.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2006 IIHF World Championships, Ovechkin scored six goals and three assists (nine points) in seven games before Russia lost 4ÿ3 to the Czech Republic in the quarter-finals. For his efforts, Ovechkin was one of six players selected to the Media All-Star Team.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2008 IIHF World Championships, Ovechkin helped lead Russia to the gold medal by finishing with 12 points (six goals, six assists) in nine games. He was selected to the Media All-Star Team for the second time in five tournament appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2010 Winter Olympics, Ovechkin and Team Russia were one of the favourites to win the Gold Medal. Despite high expectations, Russia lost to Canada 7ÿ3 in the quarterfinals. Ovechkin finished with two goals and two assists in Russia's four games.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being eliminated in the first round of the NHL playoffs, Ovechkin joined Russia for the 2010 IIHF World Championships along with many other Russian stars, such as Evgeni Malkin, Pavel Datsyuk and Ilya Kovalchuk. Despite being heavily favoured to win the tournament, Russia lost to the Czech Republic in the finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin also joined the Russian team for the 2011 IIHF World Championships after the Capitals were eliminated from the NHL playoffs. He played in five games for the Russian team, but did not manage to score any points, the first time he failed to score any points in a World Championship tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin played in Russia's last three games of the 2012 IIHF World Championships. He recorded two goals and two assists as Russia won the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin also represented Russia in 2013 IIHF World Championships. He joined the national team after the Capitals were eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs in 2013. Russia had already advanced to the first playoff round where they faced the U.S. The Americans defeated Russia 8ÿ3, eliminating them from the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2014 Winter Olympics, Ovechkin represented Russia under enormous pressure as the tournament was hosted on home ice in Sochi. Russia lost to arch-rivals Finland 3ÿ1 in the quarter-final round.\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin participated in the 2014 IIHF World Championships where Russia won gold. After the tournament, he asked Vladimir Putin to reward the Russian hockey team on an equal basis with the 2014 Olympic champions.[87][88] That was criticized as the World Championship was considered insignificant compared to Olympic gold, which Russia had failed to win earlier that year in Sochi.[89] He also joined the Russian team late in the 2015 IIHF World Championships, where Russia won the silver medal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin is the cover athlete of 2K Sports hockey simulation video game NHL 2K10, as well as the cover athlete of EA Sports' NHL 07. On 11 June 2008, Ovechkin launched his own line of designer streetwear with CCM.[90] On 6 July 2009, Ovechkin was named an ambassador for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.[91] In late 2009, he was named GQ's 48th most powerful person in Washington, D.C.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2010ÿ11 season, Ovechkin has been featured in one of ESPN's This is SportsCenter commercials, in which he laughed off a question by ESPN personality Steve Levy accusing him of being a Russian spy before being pulled upward by a line through an open ceiling tile by countryman and then-Capitals teammate Semyon Varlamov.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin is a dedicated car enthusiast, owning many fine automobiles, such as a Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG Black Series and a custom Mercedes S63 AMG.[citation needed] At the 2015 NHL All-Star Game, Ovechkin lobbied Honda for a new car, and brought an element of fun silliness to the \\"draft\\" where he was chosen third to last; the last two players selected, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Filip Forsberg, each received a new car, but Ovechkin would not give up. When Honda representatives asked his agent why he wanted a car so badly, they were told that he planned to donate it to the American Special Hockey Association, and at the end of the event, he was handed the keys to a new Honda Accord. That Accord was auctioned off, and the proceeds used to benefit the charity Ovechkin highlighted and brought attention to with his antics.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2017 Ovechkin started a movement called PutinTeam in support of Russian President Vladimir Putin with the support of Russian actors, sportsmen, musicians and NHL players including Evgeni Malkin, Ilya Kovalchuk and others.[95][96]\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin was reportedly involved in a feud with Pittsburgh Penguins forward Evgeni Malkin, who was drafted second behind Ovechkin in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. Though the two were reported to be good friends when they roomed together during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, this friendship quickly cooled.[97] The feud may have started in August 2007 when Ovechkin supposedly punched Malkin's Russian agent, Gennady Ushakov, at a Moscow nightclub. Ovechkin has denied that version of events, while Malkin confirmed it. On 21 January 2008, in Pittsburgh, when Ovechkin took a run at Malkin, which would have seemingly resulted in a devastating hit had Malkin not ducked out of the way just in time. The two would also not make eye contact at the 2008 NHL Awards Ceremony. Ovechkin has repeatedly denied \\"having it out\\" for Malkin.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe feud raised many concerns as to its effect on the league,[97] and the Russian national team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.[98] On 24 January 2009, at the SuperSkills Competition, Malkin assisted Ovechkin in his stunt during the Breakaway Challenge.[99] Malkin handed Ovechkin his props for the stunt as well as handing him his stick and pouring some sports drink down Ovechkin's throat. Though there is no final word on the nature and status of the feud, considering their past interactions, this incident appears to show that the feud has effectively ended. It has been reported that Ilya Kovalchuk, who was then the Atlanta Thrashers' captain and is also teammate of Ovechkin and Malkin on the Russian national team, brokered the peace between the two.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ovechkin was 10 years old, his brother Sergei died from a blood clot following a car accident. Sergei had supported Ovechkin's interest in hockey at a young age. The day after Sergei's death, Ovechkin had a youth game which his parents, Mikhail Ovechkin and Tatyana Ovechkina,[101] insisted he would play in. \\"It was hard, I was crying. I remember I was crying that day\\", Ovechkin said in an interview. \\"I was on the bench, I was crying. But my shift, my coach said okay, go play. And I played and I was crying. It was hard but at 10 years old, you obviously [don't] realize what's happening. It was a hard moment for my mom and dad, for all my family because oldest son passed away. It was a hard time.\\"[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nOvechkin was formerly engaged to tennis player Maria Kirilenko. On 21 July 2014, Kirilenko announced that the wedding was called off and that the two were no longer seeing each other.[103] On 11 September 2015, Ovechkin announced via Instagram his engagement to Nastya Shubskaya (daughter of Vera Glagoleva)[104] whom he subsequently married.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 June 2018, in an interview after winning his first Stanley Cup, it was made public that Ovechkin and his wife are expecting their first child.\\"[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nBold indicates led league","input":"Who was the captain of the washington capitals before ovechkin?"},{"output":"solid","context":"Aluminic hydroxide\\r\\nAluminium(III) hydroxide\\r\\nAluminium hydroxide\\r\\nAluminum trihydroxide\\r\\nHydrated alumina\\r\\nAluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is found in nature as the mineral gibbsite (also known as hydrargillite) and its three much rarer polymorphs: bayerite, doyleite, and nordstrandite. Aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric in nature, i.e., it has both basic and acidic properties. Closely related are aluminium oxide hydroxide, AlO(OH), and aluminium oxide or alumina (Al2O3), the latter of which is also amphoteric. These compounds together are the major components of the aluminium ore bauxite.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe naming for the different forms of aluminium hydroxide is ambiguous and there is no universal standard. All four polymorphs have a chemical composition of aluminium trihydroxide (an aluminium atom attached to three hydroxide groups).[5]\\r\\nGibbsite is also known as hydrargillite, named after the Greek words for water (hydra) and clay (argylles). The first compound named hydrargillite was thought to be aluminium hydroxide, but was later found to be aluminium phosphate; despite this, both gibbsite and hydrargillite are used to refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide, with gibbsite used most commonly in the United States and hydrargillite used more often in Europe. In 1930, it was referred to as ϫ-alumina trihydrate to contrast it with bayerite, which was called -alumina trihydrate (the alpha and beta designations were used to differentiate the more- and less-common forms respectively). In 1957, a symposium on alumina nomenclature attempted to develop a universal standard, resulting in gibbsite being designated -Al(OH)3, bayerite becoming ϫ-Al(OH)3, and nordstrandite being designated Al(OH)3. Based on their crystallographic properties, a suggested nomenclature and designation is for gibbsite to be ϫ-Al(OH)3, bayerite to be designated -Al(OH)3, and both nordstrandite and doyleite are designated Al(OH)3. Under this designation, the ϫ and  prefixes refer to hexagonal, close-packed structures and altered or dehydrated polymorphisms respectively, with no differentiation between nordstrandite and doyleite.[5]\\r\\nGibbsite has a typical metal hydroxide structure with hydrogen bonds. It is built up of double layers of hydroxyl groups with aluminium ions occupying two-thirds of the octahedral holes between the two layers.[6][7]\\r\\nAluminium hydroxide is amphoteric. In acid, it acts as a Br?nsted-Lowry base by picking up hydrogen ions and neutralizes the acid, yielding a salt:[8]\\r\\nIn bases, it acts a Lewis acid by taking an electron pair from the hydroxide ions:[8]\\r\\nFour polymorphs of aluminium hydroxide exist, all based on the common combination of one aluminium atom and three hydroxide molecules into different crystalline arrangements that determine the appearance and properties of the compound. The four combinations are:[5]\\r\\nAll polymorphs are composed of layers of octahedral aluminium hydroxide units with the aluminium atom in the centre and the hydroxyl groups on the sides, with hydrogen bonds holding the layers together. The polymorphisms vary in how the layers stack together, with the arrangements of the molecules and layers determined by the acidity, presence of ions (including salt) and the surface of the minerals the substance forms on. Under most conditions, gibbsite is the most chemically stable form of aluminium hydroxide. All forms of Al(OH)3 crystals are hexagonal.[5]\\r\\nVirtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the Bayer process[9] which involves dissolving bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to 270?C (518?F). The waste solid, bauxite tailings, is removed and aluminium hydroxide is precipitated from the remaining solution of sodium aluminate. This aluminium hydroxide can be converted to aluminium oxide or alumina by calcination.\\r\\nThe residue or bauxite tailings, which is mostly iron oxide, is highly caustic due to residual sodium hydroxide. It was historically stored in lagoons; this led to the Ajka alumina plant accident in 2010 in Hungary, where a dam bursting led to the drowning of nine people. An additional 122 sought treatment for chemical burns. The mud contaminated 40 square kilometres (15?sq?mi) of land and reached the Danube. While the mud was considered non-toxic due to low levels of heavy metals, the associated slurry had pH of 13.[10]\\r\\nOne of the major uses of aluminium hydroxide is as a feedstock for the manufacture of other aluminium compounds: speciality calcined aluminas, aluminium sulfate, polyaluminium chloride, aluminium chloride, zeolites, sodium aluminate, activated alumina, and aluminium nitrate.[7]\\r\\nFreshly precipitated aluminium hydroxide forms gels, which are the basis for the application of aluminium salts as flocculants in water purification. This gel crystallizes with time. Aluminium hydroxide gels can be dehydrated (e.g. using water-miscible non-aqueous solvents like ethanol) to form an amorphous aluminium hydroxide powder, which is readily soluble in acids. Aluminium hydroxide powder which has been heated to an elevated temperature under carefully controlled conditions is known as activated alumina and is used as a desiccant, as an adsorbent in gas purification, as a Claus catalyst support for water purification, and as an adsorbent for the catalyst during the manufacture of polyethylene by the Sclairtech process.[citation needed]\\r\\nAluminium hydroxide also finds use as a fire retardant filler for polymer applications in a similar way to magnesium hydroxide and mixtures of huntite and hydromagnesite.[11][12][13][14][15] It decomposes at about 180?C (356?F), absorbing a considerable amount of heat in the process and giving off water vapour. In addition to behaving as a fire retardant, it is very effective as a smoke suppressant in a wide range of polymers, most especially in polyesters, acrylics, ethylene vinyl acetate, epoxies, PVC and rubber.[16]\\r\\nUnder the generic name \\"algeldrate\\", aluminium hydroxide is used as an antacid in humans and animals (mainly cats and dogs). It is preferred over other alternatives such as sodium bicarbonate because Al(OH)3, being insoluble, does not increase the pH of stomach above 7 and hence, does not trigger secretion of excess acid by the stomach. Brand names include Alu-Cap, Aludrox, Gaviscon or Pepsamar. It reacts with excess acid in the stomach, reducing the acidity of the stomach content,[17][18] which may relieve the symptoms of ulcers, heartburn or dyspepsia. Such products can cause constipation, because the aluminium ions inhibit the contractions of smooth muscle cells in the gastrointestinal tract, slowing peristalsis and lengthening the time needed for stool to pass through the colon.[19] Some such products (such as Maalox) are formulated to minimize such effects through the inclusion of equal concentrations of magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate, which have counterbalancing laxative effects.[20]\\r\\nThis compound is also used to control hyperphosphatemia (elevated phosphate, or phosphorus, levels in the blood) in people and animals suffering from kidney failure. Normally, the kidneys filter excess phosphate out from the blood, but kidney failure can cause phosphate to accumulate. The aluminium salt, when ingested, binds to phosphate in the intestines and reduce the amount of phosphorus that can be absorbed.[21][22]\\r\\nPrecipitated aluminium hydroxide is included as an adjuvant in some vaccines (e.g. anthrax vaccine). One of the well-known brands of aluminium hydroxide adjuvant is Alhydrogel, made by Brenntag Biosector.[23][full citation needed] Since it absorbs protein well, it also functions to stabilize vaccines by preventing the proteins in the vaccine from precipitating or sticking to the walls of the container during storage. Aluminium hydroxide is sometimes mistakenly called \\"alum\\", which properly refers to aluminium potassium sulfate.[citation needed]\\r\\nVaccine formulations containing aluminium hydroxide stimulate the immune system by inducing the release of uric acid, an immunological danger signal. This strongly attracts certain types of monocytes which differentiate into dendritic cells. The dendritic cells pick up the antigen, carry it to lymph nodes, and stimulate T cells and B cells.[24] It appears to contribute to induction of a good Th2 response, so is useful for immunizing against pathogens that are blocked by antibodies. However, it has little capacity to stimulate cellular (Th1) immune responses, important for protection against many pathogens,[25] nor is it useful when the antigen is peptide-based.[26]\\r\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s it was speculated that aluminium was related to various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.[27][28] Since then, multiple epidemiological studies have found no connection between exposure to aluminium and neurological disorders.[29][30][31]","input":"Is aluminum hydroxide a solid liquid or gas?"},{"output":"in 1920","context":"","input":"When did women get the right to vote?"},{"output":"November 1895","context":"","input":"When was the lee enfield rifle first used?"},{"output":"The New Zealand National Party","context":"The New Zealand National Party (Mori: Rp Nhinara o Aotearoa),[5] shortened to National (Nhinara) or the Nats,[6] is a centre-right, liberal-conservative political party in New Zealand.[3] It is one of two major parties in contemporary New Zealand politics, alongside its historic rival, the New Zealand Labour Party.\\r\\nNational is New Zealand's second-oldest extant political party,[7] originating in 1936 with the merger of the two main conservative parties, Reform and United. They had previously formed a coalition against the growing labour movement. National has governed for five periods in the course of the 20th and 21st centuriesit has held office in New Zealand for more years than any other party.[8][9] Historically, the party's policy platform shifted from moderate economic liberalism to increased emphasis on state interventionism under the Third National Government (1975 to 1984).[10] Following the free-market reforms of the rival Labour Government in the 1980s, National has again advocated free enterprise, reduction of taxes, and individual rights.\\r\\nFrom 2008 to 2017, National was the largest party in a minority government with support from the centrist United Future, the classical-liberal ACT Party and the indigenous-rights-based Mori Party. Bill English has been the party leader since 12 December 2016. At the 2017 general election, the party gained 44.4% of the party vote and won 56 seats in the House of Representatives.[11] It currently comprises the largest caucus in the House of Representatives, and forms the Official Opposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Zealand National Party has been characterised as encompassing both conservative and liberal tendencies (with the two in tension), and outlying populist and libertarian tendencies.[1] The party's principles, last revised in 2003, seek \\"a safe, prosperous and successful New Zealand that creates opportunities for all New Zealanders to reach their personal goals and dreams\\".[1][12] It supports a limited welfare state but says that work, merit, innovation and personal initiative must be encouraged to reduce unemployment and boost economic growth. In a 1959 speech, party leader and Prime Minister Keith Holyoake encapsulated the conservative and liberal principles of the National Party:\\r\\nWe believe in the maximum degree of personal freedom and the maximum degree of individual choice for our people. We believe in the least interference necessary with individual rights, and the least possible degree of state interference.[13]\\r\\nHistorically the party supported a higher degree of state intervention than it has in recent decades.[14] The First, Second and Third National governments generally sought to preserve the economic and social stability of New Zealand, mainly keeping intact the high degree of protectionism and the strong welfare state built up by the First Labour Government.[14] The last major interventionist policy was Prime Minister Robert Muldoon's massive infrastructure projects designed to ensure New Zealand's energy independence after the 1973 oil shock, \\"Think Big\\".[12][15]\\r\\nThe Fourth National Government mostly carried on the sweeping free-market reforms of the Fourth Labour Government known as \\"Rogernomics\\", after Labour's finance minister Sir Roger Douglas. The corporatisation and sale of numerous state-owned enterprises, the abolishment of collective bargaining and major government spending cuts were introduced under the Fourth National Government, policies that were popularly known as \\"Ruthanasia\\" (National's finance minister at the time was Ruth Richardson).[16]\\r\\nFollowing the moderate Fifth Labour Government, the Fifth National Government took power in 2008 under John Key. Historically, the National Party has tended to take a social conservative position on most political issues, though more recently in certain hot-button issues the party has taken a more social liberal stance. For instance, they extended free general practitioner visits to children under 13 as part of their 2014 election package, as well as extending paid parental leave by two weeks to 16 weeks.[6] The National parliamentary caucus was split on the issue of same-sex marriage in 2014.[17]\\r\\nNational is generally in favour of free-trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[18]\\r\\nThe National Party was formed in May 1936, but its roots go considerably further back. The party came about as the result of a merger between the United Party (known as the Liberal Party until 1927, except for a short period between 1925 and 1927 when it used the name \\"National Party\\") and the Reform Party.[7] The United Party gained its main support from the cities, and drew upon businesses for money and upon middle class electors for votes,[19] while the Reform Party had a rural base and received substantial support from farmers,[20] who then formed a substantial proportion of the population.\\r\\nHistorically, the Liberal and Reform parties had competed against each other, but from 1931 until 1935 a UnitedÿReform Coalition held power in New Zealand.[21] The coalition went into the 1935 election under the title of the \\"National Political Federation\\", a name adopted to indicate that the grouping intended to represent New Zealanders from all backgrounds (in contrast to the previous situation, where United served city-dwellers and Reform served farmers). However, because of the effects of the Great Depression and a perception that the existing coalition government had handled the situation poorly, the National Political Federation lost heavily in 1935 to the Labour Party, the rise of which had prompted the alliance. The two parties were cut down to 19 seats between them. Another factor was a third party, the Democrat Party formed by Albert Davy, a former organiser for the coalition who disapproved of the \\"socialist\\" measures that the coalition had introduced. The new party split the conservative vote and aided Labour's victory.\\r\\nIn hopes of countering Labour's rise, United and Reform decided to turn their alliance into a single party. This party, the New Zealand National Party, was formed at a meeting held in Wellington on 13 and 14 May 1936. Erstwhile members of the United and Reform parties made up the bulk of the new party. The United Party's last leader, George Forbes, Prime Minister from 1930 until 1935, opened the conference; he served as Leader of the Opposition from May until November, when former Reform MP Adam Hamilton was elected the first leader. Hamilton led the party into its first election in 1938. He got the top job primarily because of a compromise between Forbes and Reform leader Gordon Coates, neither of whom wished to serve under the other. Hamilton, however, failed to counter Labour's popular Prime Minister, Michael Joseph Savage effectively. Because of this, perceptions that he remained too much under the control of Coates and because he lacked real support from his party colleagues, Hamilton failed to prevent Labour's re-election in 1938. In 1940 Sidney Holland replaced Hamilton. William Polson \\"acted effectively as Holland's deputy\\" (Gustafson[not specific enough to verify]). One former Reform MP Herbert Kyle resigned in 1942 in protest at the \\"autocratic\\" behaviour of Holland and the new party organisation.\\r\\nIn the 1943 election Labour's majority was reduced, but it remained in power. In the 1946 election, National also failed to unseat Labour. However, in the 1949 election, thirteen years after the party's foundation, National finally won power, and Holland became Prime Minister.\\r\\nIn 1949 National had campaigned on \\"the private ownership of production, distribution and exchange\\". Once in power the new Holland Government proved decidedly administratively conservative, retaining, for instance, the welfare state set up by the previous Labour Government; though National gained, and has largely kept, a reputation for showing more favour to farmers and to business than did the Labour Party.\\r\\nIn 1951 the Waterfront Dispute broke out, lasting 151 days. The National government stepped into the conflict, acting in opposition to the maritime unions. Holland also used this opportunity to call the 1951 snap election. Campaigning on an anti-Communist platform and exploiting the Labour Opposition's apparent indecisiveness, National returned with an increased majority, gaining 54 parliamentary seats out of 80.\\r\\nIn the 1954 election, National was elected to a third term, though losing some of its seats. Towards the end of his third term, however, Holland became increasingly ill, and stepped down from the leadership shortly before the general election in 1957. Keith Holyoake, the party's long-standing deputy leader, took Holland's place. Holyoake, however, had insufficient time to establish himself in the public mind as Prime Minister, and lost in the election later that year to Labour, then led by Walter Nash.\\r\\nNash's government became very unpopular as Labour acquired a reputation for poor economic management, and much of the public saw its 1958 Budget, known since as the \\"Black Budget\\", as miserly.[22] After only one term in office, Labour suffered defeat at the hands of Holyoake and the National Party in the elections of 1960.\\r\\nHolyoake's government lasted twelve years, the party gaining re-election three times (in 1963, 1966, and 1969). However, this period Social Credit arose, which broke the National/Labour duopoly in parliament, winning former National seats from 1966. Holyoake retired from the premiership and from the party leadership at the beginning of 1972, and his deputy, Jack Marshall, replaced him.\\r\\nMarshall suffered the same fate as Holyoake. Having succeeded an experienced leader in an election-year, he failed to establish himself in time. Marshall had an added disadvantage; he had to compete against the much more popular and charismatic Norman Kirk, then leader of the Labour Party, and lost the ensuing election. Unpopular policies, including initiating clear felling of parts of the Warawara kauri forest, also needlessly alienated voters.[23]\\r\\nWithin two years the National Party removed Marshall as its parliamentary leader and replaced him with Robert Muldoon, who had previously served as Minister of Finance. An intense contest between Kirk and Muldoon followed. Kirk became ill and died in office (1974); his successor, Bill Rowling, proved no match for Muldoon, and in the 1975 election, National under Muldoon returned comfortably to power.\\r\\nThe Muldoon administration, which favoured interventionist economic policies, arouses mixed opinions amongst the free-market adherents of the modern National. Bill Birch's \\"Think Big\\" initiatives, designed to invest public money in energy self-sufficiency, stand in contrast to the party's contemporary[update] views.[10] Muldoon's autocratic leadership style became increasingly unpopular with both the public and the party, and together with disgruntlement over economic policy led to an attempted leadership change in 1980. Led by ministers Derek Quigley, Jim McLay, and Jim Bolger, the challenge (dubbed the \\"colonels' coup\\") against Muldoon aimed to replace him with Brian Talboys, his deputy. However, the plan collapsed as the result of Talboys' unwillingness, and Muldoon kept his position.[24]\\r\\nUnder Muldoon, National won three consecutive general elections in 1975, 1978 and 1981. However, public dissatisfaction grew, and Muldoon's controlling and belligerent style of leadership became less and less appealing. In both the 1978 and 1981 elections, National gained fewer votes than the Labour opposition, but could command a small majority in Parliament because of the then-used First Past the Post electoral system.\\r\\nDissent within the National Party continued to grow, however, with rebel National MPs Marilyn Waring and Mike Minogue causing particular concern to the leadership, threatening National's thin majority in parliament. When, in 1984, Marilyn Waring refused to support Muldoon's policies on visits by nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships, Muldoon called a snap election. Muldoon made the television announcement of this election while visibly inebriated, and some believe[citation needed] that he later regretted the decision to \\"go to the country\\". National lost the election to Labour under David Lange.\\r\\nShortly after this loss, the National Party removed Muldoon from the leadership. Jim McLay, who had replaced Brian Talboys as deputy leader shortly before the election, became the new leader. McLay, an urban liberal with right wing views on economics, however, failed to restore the party's fortunes. In 1986 Jim Bolger took over the leadership with the support of centrists within the party.\\r\\nIn the 1990 election National defeated Labour in an electoral landslide and formed a new government under Jim Bolger. However, the party lost some support from Muldoon era policy based conservatives when it continued the economic reforms which had ultimately led to the defeat of the previous Labour governmentthese policies, started by Labour Party Finance Minister Roger Douglas and popularly known as Rogernomics, centred on the privatization of state assets and on the removal of tariffs and subsidies. These policies alienated traditional Labour supporters, who saw them as a betrayal of the party's social service based character, but did not appear to appease the membership base of the non-parliamentary party either, which still had a significant supporter base for the statist intervention style policies of the Muldoon Government.\\r\\nMany more conservative and centrist National supporters preferred Muldoon's more authoritarian and interventionist policies over the free-market liberalism promoted by Douglas. However, the new National Party Finance Minister, Ruth Richardson, strongly supported Rogernomics, believing that Douglas had not gone far enough. Her policiesdubbed \\"Ruthanasia\\" encouraged two MPs to leave the National Party and form the New Zealand Liberal Party (1992). Richardson's views also met with considerable opposition within the National Party Parliamentary Caucus and for a time caused damage to the party's membership base.\\r\\nAt the 1993 election, National was narrowly able to secure its position in government due partly to a strongly recovering economy, after its large majority disappeared and the country faced an election night hung parliamentNational one seat short of the required 50 seats to govern. With special votes counted in the following days, National won Waitaki, allowing it to form a government but requiring the election of a Speaker from the opposition benches (Peter Tapsell of the Labour Party) to hold a working majority in the House. At the same time as the election, however, a referendum took place which established the MMP electoral system for future use in New Zealand general elections. This would have a significant impact on New Zealand politics. Some National Party MPs defected to a new grouping, United New Zealand in mid-1995. And as a result of the new electoral mechanics, the New Zealand First party, led by former National MP and former Cabinet minister Winston Peters, held the balance of power after the 1996 election. After a prolonged period of negotiation lasting nearly two months, in which New Zealand First played National and Labour off against each other (both parties negotiated complete coalition agreements), New Zealand First entered into a coalition with National.\\r\\nUnder the coalition agreement, Peters became Deputy Prime Minister and had the post of Treasurer especially created by the Crown for him. New Zealand First extracted a number of other concessions from National in exchange for its support. The influence of New Zealand First angered many National MPs, particularly Jenny Shipley.\\r\\nWhen, in 1997, Shipley toppled Bolger to become National's new leader, relations between National and its coalition partner deteriorated. After Shipley sacked Peters from Cabinet in 1998, New Zealand First split into two groups and half the MPs followed Peters out of the coalition but the remainder broke away, establishing themselves as independents or as members of new parties of which none survived the 1999 election. From the latter group National gained enough support to continue in government with additional confidence support of Alamein Kopu a defect Alliance List MP. The visibly damaged National Government managed to survive the parliamentary term, but lost the election to Labour's Helen Clark and the Alliance's Jim Anderton, who formed a coalition government.\\r\\nShipley continued to lead the National Party until 2001, when Bill English replaced her. English, however, proved unable to gain traction against Clark, and National suffered its worst-ever electoral defeat in the 2002 election, gaining only 27 of 120 seats.[25] Many hoped that English would succeed in rebuilding the party, given time, but a year later polling showed the party performing only slightly better than in the election. In October 2003 English gave way as leader to Don Brash, a former governor of the Reserve Bank who had joined the National Parliamentary caucus in the 2002 election.\\r\\nUnder Brash, the National Party's overall popularity with voters improved markedly. Mostly, however, the party achieved this by \\"reclaiming\\" support from electors who voted for other centre-right parties in 2002. National's campaigning on race relations, amid claims of preferential treatment of Mori, and amid their opposition to Labour Party policy during the foreshore-and-seabed controversy, generated considerable publicity and much controversy. Strong campaigning on a tax-cuts theme in the lead-up to the 2005 election, together with a consolidation of centre-right support, may have contributed to the National Party's winning 48 out of 121 seats in Parliament. National, however, remained the second-largest party in Parliament (marginally behind Labour, which gained 50 seats), and had fewer options for forming a coalition government. With the formation of a new Labour-dominated Government, National remained the major Opposition party. Before the leadership of John Key, the National Party had made renewed efforts to attract social conservative voters, through adoption of pro-life and anti-same-sex marriage policies.\\r\\nAfter the 2005 election defeat Don Brash's leadership of National came under scrutiny from the media, and political watchers speculated on the prospect of a leadership-challenge before the next general election due in 2008. Don Brash resigned on 23 November 2006, immediately before the release of Nicky Hager's book The Hollow Men, which contained damaging revelations obtained from private emails. John Key became the leader of the National caucus on 27 November 2006. Key fostered a more \\"centrist\\" image, discussing issues such as child poverty.\\r\\nOn 8 November 2008 the National Party won 58 seats in the general election. The Labour Party, which had spent three terms in power, conceded the election and Prime Minister Helen Clark stepped down. National formed a minority government under John Key with confidence-and-supply support from the ACT Party (5 seats), the Mori Party (5 seats) and United Future (1 seat). On 19 November the Governor-General swore in the new National-led government.[26] In Key's first Cabinet he gave the ACT Party's Rodney Hide and Heather Roy ministerial portfolios outside Cabinet, and the Mori Party's Tariana Turia and Pita Sharples the same. United Future leader Peter Dunne retained his ministerial post outside Cabinet which he had held within the immediately preceding Labour Government.\\r\\nThe government cut taxes on all income; the top personal tax rate was lowered from 39% to 38% and then 33% in 2010.[27]\\r\\nAt the 26 November 2011 general election, National gained 47.31% of the party vote, the highest percentage gained by any political party since MMP was introduced, helped by a lower voter turnout and the misfortunes of its traditional support parties. A reduced wasted vote enabled the party to gain 59 seats in Parliament, one more than in 2008. National re-entered confidence-and-supply agreements with ACT (one seat) and United Future (one seat) on 5 December 2011, enabling it to form a minority government with the support of 61 seats in the new 121-seat Parliament. National also re-entered a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Mori Party on 11 December 2011 for extra insurance, despite the parties differing on National's contentious plans to partially sell (or \\"extend the mixed ownership model to\\") four state-owned enterprises. This nearly led to a cancellation of the agreement in February 2012 over Treaty of Waitangi obligations for the mixed ownership companies, and again in July 2012 over water rights.\\r\\nThe government introduced the \\"mixed ownership model\\" plan, in which the Government planned to reduce its share in Genesis Energy, Meridian Energy, Mighty River Power and Solid Energy from 100% to 51% and Air New Zealand from 74% to 51%, and sell off the remainder. The plans to sell down Solid Energy were later axed due to the company's poor financial position. A citizens-initiated referendum on the sell-downs returned a 67.3% vote in opposition (on a turnout of 45.1%).\\r\\nThe National Government won a third term at the 2014 general election. The National Party won 47.04% of the party vote, and increased its seats to 60. National resumed its confidence and supply agreements with ACT and United Future.\\r\\nAfter serving Prime Minister for eight years, Key announced his resignation as the party leader on 5 December 2016. He stepped down as Prime Minister on 12 December.[28] Key's deputy Bill English was acclaimed as the party's new leader on 12 December 2016 after Health Minister Jonathan Coleman and Minister of Police Judith Collins withdrew from the leadership election.[29][30]\\r\\nIn the 2017 general election, National's share of the party vote dropped to 44.4 percent. It lost four seats, dropping to 56, but remained the largest party in Parliament.[11] New Zealand First, led by Winston Peters, held the balance of power, and formed a coalition with Labour, who also gained Green party support, marking an end to the 9-year National government.\\r\\nNational features both regional and electorate-level organisational structures. National traditionally had a strongly decentralised organisation, designed to allow electorates and the five regions to appeal to the unique voter base in their area. However, in light of the 2002 election result, a review of the party organisation resulted in decisions to weaken the regional structure and to implement a more centralised structure in order to make the structure more 'appropriate' for the new mixed member proportional electoral system.[31] The Party President (currently[update] Peter Goodfellow) heads the administration outside of National's current sitting MPs.\\r\\nThe party's youth wing, the Young Nationals, commonly known as the Young Nats, has provided much political impetus[citation needed] as a ginger group.\\r\\nThe Bluegreens are a group within National who help formulate green environmental policy.[32]\\r\\nKey:\\r\\n??National ??Labour\\r\\nPM: Prime Minister\\r\\nLO: Leader of the Opposition\\r\\nShort biographies of all presidents up to Sue Wood appear in Barry Gustafson's The First Fifty Years.","input":"What does the nz national party stand for?"},{"output":"GMC Yukon XL","context":"","input":"What is the gmc version of the suburban?"},{"output":"throughout much of Australia","context":"Eight species, see text.\\r\\nPogona is a genus of reptiles containing nine lizard species,(according to some sources, but some others say eight) which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The name \\"bearded dragon\\" refers to the \\"beard\\" of the dragon, the underside of the throat which turns black if they are stressed or see a potential rival. They are adept climbers, spending time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation. Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout much of Australia in a wide range of habitats such as deserts, shrublands and Eucalyptus woodlands.[2]\\r\\nSeveral species of this genus, especially the central bearded dragon, are often kept as pets or exhibited in zoos due to their hardy nature and easy care in comparison to other exotic reptiles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genus Pogona is in the subfamily Amphibolurinae of the lizard family Agamidae. Characteristics include broad, triangular heads and flattened bodies with spiny scales arranged in rows and clusters. These are found on the throat, which can be expanded when threatened, and at the back of the head. These scales are used to scare off predators, yet they are not very sharp. Bearded dragons display a hand-waving gesture to show submission, and a head-bobbing display to show dominance between dragons. They have the ability to change color during rivalry challenges between males, in response to ambient temperature changes such as turning black to absorb heat, and other stimuli. Males grow up to 60?cm (24?in) long, and females up to 51?cm (20?in). Bearded dragons also produce a mild venom originating from primitive venom glands. Although generally harmless towards humans, it is effective towards smaller-sized animals.[3][4][2]\\r\\nBearded dragons originate from central Australia,[citation needed] where they live in the arid and subtropical woodlands, scrublands, savannas, shore areas, and into the great interior deserts.[5] Their range extends throughout the interior of the eastern states to the eastern half of South Australia and southeastern Northern Territory.[citation needed] They spend most of their time in bushes and trees, and will often bask on rocks.[6] When the climate is too hot they will often burrow underground.[7]\\r\\nAdult bearded dragons are very territorial. As they grow, they establish social hierarchies in which displays of aggression and appeasement form a normal part of their social interactions. The beard is used for both mating and aggression displays. Both sexes have a beard, but males display more frequently, especially in courtship rituals. Females also display their beard as a sign of aggression. The beard darkens, sometimes turning jet black, and inflates during the display. The bearded dragon may also open its mouth and gape in addition to inflating its beard to appear more intimidating. Head bobbing is another behaviour seen in both females and males; they quickly move their head up and down, often darkening and flaring their beard. They do this to show dominance over smaller males and weaker males. Males will also use this display to impress females and as a deterrent if they feel threatened. Both males and females will display an arm waving behaviour. It lifts one of its front legs and moves it in a circular pattern. Arm waving functions as species recognition, and it is a sign of submission. Smaller males will often respond to larger males by arm waving. Females will also arm wave to avoid male aggression, often in response to a male's head bobbing.[8]\\r\\nThe following eight species are recognized as being valid.[9]\\r\\nNota bene: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than Pogona.\\r\\nBearded dragons are kept as pets. Most commonly, the inland or central bearded dragon (sometimes Rankin's bearded dragon) are in captivity.\\r\\nIntroduced as pets to the US during the 1990s, they are a popular exotic species pet even though Australia, from the 1960s onward, has banned the sale of its wildlife to the pet trade.[citation needed] They are a popular species among children because of their friendly and calm nature, and the relative ease of caring for them.[10] Generally speaking, the bearded dragon is a solitary animal. Male bearded dragons are usually housed alone, as they will fight with other males and breed with females. Captive adults reach about 40 to 61?cm (16 to 24?in) from head to tail, weigh 350 to 600?g (10 to 20?oz)[11] and live for about 8 to 12 years with good care.[2] They can live up to a maximum of 14 years in captivity.[12]\\r\\nJuvenile and baby bearded dragon diets consist mainly of insects. A juvenile bearded dragon eats insects three times a day on average. Only feed bearded dragons enough insects which they can eat within 15 minutes, remove any left-over insects after this time. After a few feedings the dragon's usual appetite can be determined.[13] Crickets and dubia roaches are the most popular insects fed to bearded dragons, but they can also be fed other insects such as black soldier fly larvae, locusts, superworms, waxworms, silkworms, butterworms, fruit flies, grasshoppers and hornworms. Bearded dragons also eat increasing amounts of plant based food as they grow; adults should have a diet consisting of more than 80% plant matter, the most important of which is leafy greens.[14]\\r\\nColor variations of the inland, or central, bearded dragon are often available from breeders. The different colors of bearded dragons display subtle differences between them and 'wild' type dragons. For example, the color of the beards may be orange or yellow, and golden brown to near black in 'wild' type dragons.\\r\\nAlthough bearded dragons are fairly resilient to illness, improper care can potentially fatally hurt a bearded dragon. Some health issues that bearded dragons may have include: metabolic bone disease, atadenovirus, impaction, and parasites\\r\\nBearded dragons housed in captivity face the risk of impaction from being kept on the wrong kind of substrate. If ingested, substrates such as sand, dirt, and alfalfa can easily be fatal. No type of loose substrate is ever risk free for any bearded dragon, especially juveniles. Acceptable tank bedding includes reptile carpet, slate tile, newspaper, and paper towels. These type of substrates may not always be considered \\"decorative\\" or appealing, but they will prevent risk of impaction.\\r\\nMetabolic bone disease (MBD) is a common disease that can be fatal for bearded dragons. It occurs in bearded dragons due to malnutrition or the use of improper lighting. Typical foods that bearded dragons eat, including spinach[15], carrots, and collards, contain oxalates that bind to and attack the calcium in the bones of the bearded dragon.[16] Bearded dragons require UVB lights to process calcium in their diet. Without processing this calcium, their bodies will use calcium from their bones, therefore weakening them. Multivitamin supplements, a proper diet, and a UVB light is necessary to keeping a bearded dragon safe from MBD. Symptoms seen in bearded dragons with MBD include bumps in the legs, twitches or tremors, bumps along the spine or tail, a swollen bottom jaw, and jerky movements.[17]\\r\\nHypocalcemia occurs when there are low levels of calcium in the bearded dragon's blood. Hypocalcemia is most often tied to metabolic bone disease. Low levels of calcium can result in twitching muscles, or seizures. Hypocalcemia is most often seen in young bearded dragons, as they are slightly more fragile than adults. Maintaining a diet which consists of enough calcium is crucial to avoiding hypocalcemia as well as metabolic bone disease.[18]\\r\\nParalysis occurs often in bearded dragons when they are fed food that is too big for them. Bearded dragons will try to eat worms or crickets that are too big for them, but this can be extremely harmful. Food should not be bigger than the space between their eyes. If a dragon eats food that is too big for them, there will be pressure put on their spinal cord during digestion. This pressure can lead to paralysis or death.[19]\\r\\nAtadenovirus (ADV), also referred to as adenovirus, is a viral disease that can be deadly. ADV can be spread between reptiles through contact alone. Most juvenile ADV-positive bearded dragons don't live past 90 days. While ADV-positive adults will live longer, they eventually contract liver diseases.[20] Common symptoms of ADV-positive bearded dragons include stunted growth and slow weight gain. Because of their compromised immune systems, ADV-positive bearded dragons may be infected with intestinal parasites. [21]\\r\\nBearded dragons require UVB to help enable Vitamin D3 synthesis and to prevent metabolic bone disease. Bearded dragons also require UVAthis wavelength stimulates feeding, breeding, basking and overall health.[22][unreliable source?]\\r\\nIn the wild, a bearded dragon will live on average 5 to 8 years. In captivity, with adequate care, they will generally live 8 to 12 years. With exemplary care they can live as long as 12 to 14 years, and rarely beyond that.[23][unreliable source?]","input":"Where are bearded dragons found in the wild?"},{"output":"Brett Kavanaugh","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is the highest ranking judicial body in the United States. Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom would constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the President of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent (confirmation) of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court. Justices have life tenure,[3] and receive a salary which is set at $255,500 per year for the chief justice and at $244,400 per year for each associate justice as of 2014.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court was created by Article III of the United States Constitution, which stipulates that the \\"judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court,\\"[7] and was organized by the 1st United States Congress. Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress specified the Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, created thirteen judicial districts, and fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices).[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1789, Congress has occasionally altered the size of the Supreme Court, historically in response to the country's own expansion in size. An 1801 act would have decreased the Court's size to five members upon its next vacancy. However, an 1802 act negated the effects of the 1801 act upon the Court before any such vacancy occurred, maintaining the Court's size at six members.  Later legislation increased its size to seven members in 1807, to nine in 1837, and to ten in 1863. An 1866 act was to have reduced the Court's size from ten members to seven upon its next three vacancies, and two vacancies did occur during this period. However, before a third vacancy occurred, the Judiciary Act of 1869 intervened, restoring the Court's size to nine members, where it has remained since.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the justices of the Supreme Court are appointed for life, many have retired or resigned. Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are currently nine justices serving on the Supreme Court; listed in order of seniority, they are:\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 114 persons have served on the Court. The length of service on the Court for the 105 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36 years, 211 days to the 163-day tenure of Thomas Johnson. As of October 29, 2018, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas' 7003986800000000000?27?years, 6?days to Brett Kavanaugh's 7001230000000000000?23?days.

He held office after the death of John Curtin, and is the shortest-serving prime minister in Australia's history.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nForde was born in Mitchell, Queensland, to Irish immigrant parents. He was a schoolteacher and telegraphist before entering politics, and eventually settled in Rockhampton. Having joined the Labor Party at a young age, Forde was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1917, aged 26. He transferred to the House of Representatives at the 1922 federal election, winning the Division of Capricornia. Forde entered cabinet in 1931, serving as Minister for Trade and Customs for what would be the final year of the Scullin Government.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Labor's landslide defeat at the 1931 election, Forde was elected deputy leader in place of Ted Theodore. He returned to cabinet in 1941 as Minister for the Army in the Curtin Government, and as the de facto deputy prime minister was one of the government's most prominent figures. When John Curtin died in office in 1945, Forde was appointed prime minister to serve while the Labor Party elected a new leader. He contested the leadership ballot against Ben Chifley and Norman Makin, but Chifley emerged victorious.\\r\\n\\r\\nForde continued on as deputy leader and army minister in the Chifley Government, but lost his seat at the 1946 election. He then served as High Commissioner to Canada from 1947 to 1953. Forde attempted to re-enter federal parliament in 1954, but was unsuccessful. He won a state by-election in Queensland the following year ÿ the only former prime minister to enter state parliament ÿ but served only a single term before again being defeated. Forde died at the age of 92, and was accorded a state funeral; Gough Whitlam is the only prime minister to have lived to a greater age.\\r\\n\\r\\nForde was born in Mitchell, Queensland, on 18 July 1890. He was the second of six children born to Ellen (ne Quirk) and John Forde. His parents were both Irish immigrants ÿ his father was born in Ballinaglera, County Leitrim, while his mother was from County Tipperary. His father was working as a grazier at the time of his birth, and later worked as a railway supervisor. Forde began his education at the local state school, and later boarded at St Mary's College, Toowoomba. He qualified as a schoolteacher via the monitorial system, but at the age of 20 joined Queensland Railways as a clerk in the telegraphy department. He later moved to Brisbane to work as a telegraphist for the Postmaster-General's Department, at the same time studying electrical engineering. In 1914, Forde was transferred to Rockhampton. He was involved with the Australian Natives' Association, the Australian Workers' Union, and the Rockhampton Workers' Political Organisation, and helped campaign for the \\"No\\" vote in the conscription referendums of 1916 and 1917.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nForde joined the Labor Party in 1915, at the urging of state MP James Larcombe, who became his mentor. In 1917, aged 26, he won a by-election to the seat of Rockhampton in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. It had been vacated by John Adamson, who had resigned from the Labor Party in the wake of the 1916 party split and unsuccessfully sought Nationalist Party preselection for the Senate. Forde was re-elected to Rockhampton at the 1918 and 1920 state elections. He was a supporter of the Central Queensland Separation Movement, one of the many new state movements active around that time.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1921, the state Labor government of Ted Theodore passed controversial legislation that allowed state MPs to run for federal parliament and automatically return to their seat in state parliament if they lost, without having to face a by-election. It was widely reported that Forde was intended to be the primary beneficiary of the new legislation. However, the federal Nationalist government responded by amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to overrule the state law. In October 1922, Forde resigned from state parliament to run in the Division of Capricornia at the 1922 federal election. He was successful, defeating Nationalist incumbent and Labor defector William Higgs.[4] Forde's successful foray into federal politics triggered the 1923 Rockhampton by-election. The bitterly fought by-election was successfully contested by Labor's George Farrell, who had worked on Forde's federal campaign.[5][6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially the youngest MP in federal parliament, Forde soon advanced in the Labor ranks. When Labor won the 1929 election, he became Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs in the Scullin government. In the last days of the government he became Minister for Trade and Customs.[8] As one of the few senior Labor MPs to survive defeat at the 1931 election, Forde became Deputy Opposition Leader in 1932. When Scullin retired in 1935, Forde contested the leadership ballot but was defeated by one vote by John Curtin, mainly because he had supported Scullin's economic policies.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nForde was a loyal deputy, and in 1941 when Labor returned to power he became Minister for the Army, a vital role in wartime.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1945, Forde left Australia to attend the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco. Late that month, Curtin was admitted to hospital; in the absence of Forde and H. V. Evatt (the Minister for External Affairs), he designated Ben Chifley as acting prime minister. Forde did not return to Australia until 2 July, but then immediately took over from Chifley. The prime minister's health had severely declined in the mean time, although he had been able to go home to The Lodge. Curtin died in his sleep in the early hours of 5 July, at the age of 60.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day that Curtin died, Forde issued a brief statement announcing the death, and then in the afternoon moved a condolence motion at a brief sitting of parliament. On the morning of the following day, 6 July, he led a procession of MPs past Curtin's coffin at Parliament House, where he was lying in state. In the afternoon, Forde attended a memorial service, and then went to Government House, where he was formally sworn in as prime minister by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, the Governor-General. He was appointed as prime minister with the understanding that he would resign if the Labor Party elected someone other than him as leader at its next caucus meeting. Forde was the Labor Party's sixth prime minister, and the fifteenth overall. He is the only Australian prime minister to have never led a political party. There was little precedent for his appointment, as only one previous prime minister (Joseph Lyons) had died in office, and Lyons had been succeeded by the leader of the smaller party in his governing coalition (Earle Page).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 July, Forde accompanied Elsie Curtin to Perth to attend her husband's funeral. Two days later, Ben Chifley told him that he would be contesting the leadership; that evening, they both issued statements announcing their candidacies. Norman Makin announced his intention to stand the following day. On the morning of 12 July, Les Haylen informed Forde that he did not have the numbers to win. In response, Forde said \\"I must say a little prayer for Ben. It's not an easy job\\". In the leadership ballot, Chifley received 45 votes to Forde's 16, Makin's seven, and Evatt's two. Several MPs were absent (including Evatt), and Rowley James unsuccessfully proposed that the ballot be postponed. Forde resigned as prime minister on 13 July, after one week in office. He is Australia's shortest-serving prime minister.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite losing the leadership contest to Chifley, Forde was re-elected as deputy leader. As Minister for Defence he was much criticised for the slowness with which military personnel were being demobilised. As a result, he lost his seat at the 1946 election, though the Labor Party itself comfortably retained office.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nChifley appointed Forde High Commissioner to Canada, and he held this position until 1953. From May 1952, he was the doyen of the diplomatic corps (the longest-serving ambassador).[13] After returning to Australia, he tried to re-enter the House of Representatives at the 1954 election, in the seat of Wide Bay, without success. In 1955, at a by-election, he returned to the Queensland Parliament as MP for Flinders.[12] He is the only Prime Minister who later served in a State Parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 1957 Queensland state election the Labor Party split resulted not only in Labor falling from power, but also in Forde being defeated in his own seat by Bill Longeran of the Country Party by one vote. Forde disputed the result and the election was declared void on 4 March 1958. However, at the by-election held on 17 May 1958, Longeran defeated Forde by over 400 votes.[14][12] Had Forde been elected, he would probably have become Labor leader in Queensland, given that Premier Vince Gair and most of Gair's followers had been expelled from the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nForde retired to Brisbane where he devoted himself to Catholic charity work. In his living room hung a large portrait of wartime US General Douglas MacArthur. On 11 April 1964, at the request of Prime Minister Robert Menzies, Forde represented Australia at MacArthur's funeral in Norfolk, Virginia.[12][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nForde died in 1983. He was accorded a state funeral which, on 3 February, proceeded from St Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in St Lucia to the Toowong Cemetery,[16] the same day that Bob Hawke was elected ALP leader. Indeed, it was at Forde's funeral that Senator John Button told then Labor leader Bill Hayden that he must step aside in favour of Hawke, which he did. Forde was the last surviving member of the Scullin, Curtin and his own Cabinet. Furthermore, he was the last surviving MP from when Stanley Bruce was Prime Minister.\\r\\n\\r\\nForde was the only deputy Labor leader who served under three leaders (Scullin, Curtin and Chifley) until Jenny Macklin (Crean, Latham and Beazley, 2001ÿ06). The electoral Division of Forde and the Canberra suburb of Forde are named after him.\\r\\n\\r\\nForde married Veronica (Vera) Catherine O'Reilly in 1925 and they had four children:[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the years that he spent in Ottawa as High Commissioner to Canada two of his daughters (Mary and Mercia) became married to Canadians. Mary (m. William Robert Thompson) eventually settled with her husband in Kingston, Ontario, Canada while Mercia (m.

Varanasi city is also called Kashi, hence this temple is Kashi Vishvanath Temple.\\r\\nThe temple has been referred to in Hindu scriptures for a very long time as a central part of worship in the Shaiva philosophy. It has been destroyed and re-constructed a number of times in history.

The original Vishwanath temple was destroyed by the army of Qutb-ud-din Aibak in 1194 CE, when he defeated the Raja of Kannauj as a commander of Mohammad Ghori. The temple was rebuilt by a Gujarati merchant during the reign of Delhi's Sultan Iltutmish (1211-1266 CE). It was demolished again during the rule of either Hussain Shah Sharqi (1447-1458) or Sikandar Lodhi (1489-1517). Raja Man Singh built the temple during Mughal emperor Akbar's rule, but orthodox Hindus boycotted it as he had let the Mughals marry within his family. Raja Todar Mal further re-built the temple with Akbar's funding at its original site in 1585.[3]\\r\\nIn 1669 CE, Emperor Aurangzeb destroyed the temple and built the Gyanvapi Mosque in its place.[4] The remains of the erstwhile temple can be seen in the foundation, the columns and at the rear part of the mosque.[5]\\r\\nGyanvapi Mosque, sketched as Temple of Vishveshvur in 1834 by James Prinsep\\r\\nPlan of the Ancient Temple of Vishveshvur, by James Prinsep[6]\\r\\nIn 1742, the Maratha ruler Malhar Rao Holkar made a plan to demolish the mosque and reconstruct Vishweshwar temple at the site.

In 1780, Malhar Rao's daughter-in-law Ahilyabai Holkar constructed the present temple adjacent to the mosque. In 1828, Baiza Bai, widow of the Maratha ruler Daulat Rao Scindhia of Gwalior State, built a low-roofed colonnade with over 40 pillars in the Gyan Vapi precinct.[8] During 1833-1840 CE, the boundary of Gyanvapi Well, the ghats and other nearby temples were constructed.A 7-feet high stone statue of Nandi bull, gifted by the Raja of Nepal lies to the east of the colonnade. Many noble families from various ancestral kingdoms of Indian subcontinent and their prior establishments make generous contributions for the operations of the temple. In 1841, the Bhosales of Nagpur donated silver to the temple. In 1835, Maharaja Ranjit Singh donated 1 tonne of gold for plating the temple's dome.[7]:200[9]\\r\\nThe temple was managed by a hereditary group of pandas or mahants. After the death of Mahant Devi Dutt, a dispute arose among his successors. In 1900, his brother-in-law Pandit Visheshwar Dayal Tewari filed a lawsuit, which resulted in him being declared the head priest.[10]\\r\\nAs per Shiva Purana, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of Harmony) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation.[11] To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either directions. Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as a second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshiped till the end of eternity. The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The jyothirlinga shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light.[12][13] There are 64 forms of Shiva, not to be confused with Jyotirlingas. Each of the twelve jyothirlinga sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered different manifestation of Shiva.[14] At all these sites, the primary image is lingam representing the beginningless and endless Stambha pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva.[14][15][16] The twelve jyothirlinga are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga, Deogarh in Deoghar, Jharkhand, Nageswar at Dwarka in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad in Maharashtra.[11][17]\\r\\nThe Manikarnika Ghat on the banks of Ganges near to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is considered as a Shakti Peetha, a revered place of worship for the Shaktism sect. The Daksha Yaga, a Shaivite literature is considered as an important literature which is the story about the origin of Shakti Peethas.[18]\\r\\nThe temple complex consists of a series of smaller shrines, located in a small lane called the Vishwanatha Galli, near the river. The linga of the main deity at the shrine is 60?cm tall and 90?cm in circumference housed in a silver altar.[19] The main temple is quadrangle and is surrounded by shrines of other gods. There are small temples for Kaalbhairav, Dhandapani, Avimukteshwara, Vishnu, Vinayaka, Sanishwara, Virupaksha and Virupaksh Gauri in the complex. There is a small well in the temple called the Jnana Vapi also spelled as Gyaan vapi (the wisdom well). The Jnana Vapi well sites to the north of the main temple and it is believed that the Jyotirlinga was hidden in the well to protect it at the time of invasion. It is said that the main priest of the temple jumped in the well with the Shiv Ling in order to protect the Jyotirlinga from invaders.\\r\\nAccording to the structure of the temple, there is a Sabha Griha or Congregation Hall leading to the inner Garbha Griha or Sanctum Sanctorum. The venerable Jyotirlinga is a dark brown colored stone which is enshrined in the Sanctum, placed on a silver platform. Structure of the Mandir is composed of three parts. The first compromises a spire on the Mandir of Lord Vishwanath or Mahadeva. The second is gold dome and the third is the gold spire atop Lord Vishwanath carrying a flag and a trident.\\r\\nThe Kashi Vishwanath temple receives around 3,000 visitors every day. On certain occasions the numbers reach 1,000,000 and more. Noteworthy about the temple is 15.5 metre high gold spire and gold dome. There are three domes each made up of pure gold.\\r\\nLocated on the banks of the holy Ganges, Varanasi is regarded among the holiest of the Hindu cities. The Kashi Vishwanath temple is widely recognized as one of the most important places of worship in Hindu religion. Inside the Kashi Vishvanath Temple is the Jyotirlinga of Shiva, Vishveshvara or Vishvanath. The Vishveshvara Jyotirlinga has a very special and unique significance in the spiritual history of India.\\r\\nMany leading saints, including Adi Sankaracharya, Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda, Bamakhyapa, Goswami Tulsidas, Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Sathya Sai Baba and Gurunanak have visited the site.[20] A visit to the temple and a bath in the river Ganges is one of many methods believed to lead one on a path to Moksha (liberation). Thus, Hindus from all over the world try to visit the place at least once in their lifetime. There is also a tradition that one should give up at least one desire after a pilgrimage the temple, and the pilgrimage would also include a visit to the temple at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu in Southern India, where people take water samples of the Ganges to perform prayer at the temple and bring back sand from near that temple. Because of the immense popularity and holiness of Kashi Vishwanath temple, hundreds of temples across India have been built in the same architectural style. Many legends record that the true devotee achieves freedom from death and sa?sra by the worship of Shiva, Shiva's devotees on death being directly taken to his abode on Mount Kailash by his messengers and not to Yama.

This core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[15] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800?km/h (1,100?mph), higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune.[16]\\r\\nThe planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system that is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 62 moons[17] are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named. This does not include the hundreds of moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[18]\\r\\nSaturn is a gas giant because it is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it may have a solid core.[19] Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268?km versus 54,364?km.[5] Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than waterabout 30% less.[20] Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69?g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times the Earth's mass,[21] and Saturn is 95 times the mass of the Earth.[5] Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.[22]\\r\\nOn 8 January 2015, NASA reported that a team of scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory determined the barycenter of the planet Saturn and its family of moons to within 4?km (2.5?mi) using data from an experiment conducted with the Cassini spacecraft and the Very Large Baseline Array.[23]\\r\\nDespite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01?g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.[22]\\r\\nStandard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles.[24] This core is similar in composition to the Earth, but more dense. Examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9ÿ22 times the mass of the Earth,[25][26] which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000?km.[27] This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000?km and consists of gas.[28][29][30]\\r\\nSaturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700?C at its core, and it radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Jupiter's thermal energy is generated by the KelvinÿHelmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression, but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn, because it is less massive. An alternative or additional mechanism may be generation of heat through the \\"raining out\\" of droplets of helium deep in Saturn's interior. As the droplets descend through the lower-density hydrogen, the process releases heat by friction and leaves Saturn's outer layers depleted of helium.[31][32] These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core.[24] Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on Saturn, as well as on Jupiter[33] and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.[34]\\r\\nThe outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume.[35] The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun.[24] The quantity of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19ÿ31 times the mass of the Earth, with a significant fraction located in Saturn's core region.[36]\\r\\nTrace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine and methane have been detected in Saturn's atmosphere.[37][38][39] The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water.[40] Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.[39]\\r\\nSaturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter. Saturn's finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the Voyager spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then, Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.[41]\\r\\nThe composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with the temperature in the range 100ÿ160?K and pressures extending between 0.5ÿ2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185ÿ270?K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3ÿ6 bar with temperatures of 190ÿ235?K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10ÿ20 bar and temperatures are 270ÿ330?K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.[42]\\r\\nSaturn's usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm was an example of a Great White Spot, a unique but short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, around the time of the northern hemisphere's summer solstice.[43] Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the most famous. If the periodicity is maintained, another storm will occur in about 2020.[44]\\r\\nThe winds on Saturn are the second fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's. Voyager data indicate peak easterly winds of 500?m/s (1800?km/h).[45] In images from the Cassini spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering.[46] Thermography has shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known example of such a phenomenon in the Solar System.[47] Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally ?185?C, temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as ?122?C, suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.[47]\\r\\nA persisting hexagonal wave pattern around the north polar vortex in the atmosphere at about 78N was first noted in the Voyager images.[48][49][50] The sides of the hexagon are each about 13,800?km (8,600?mi) long, which is longer than the diameter of the Earth.[51] The entire structure rotates with a period of 10h 39m 24s (the same period as that of the planet's radio emissions) which is assumed to be equal to the period of rotation of Saturn's interior.[52] The hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible atmosphere.[53] The pattern's origin is a matter of much speculation. Most scientists think it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere. Polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of fluids.[54][55]\\r\\nHST imaging of the south polar region indicates the presence of a jet stream, but no strong polar vortex nor any hexagonal standing wave.[56] NASA reported in November 2006 that Cassini had observed a \\"hurricane-like\\" storm locked to the south pole that had a clearly defined eyewall.[57][58] Eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than Earth. For example, images from the Galileo spacecraft did not show an eyewall in the Great Red Spot of Jupiter.[59]\\r\\nThe south pole storm may have been present for billions of years.[60] This vortex is comparable to the size of Earth, and it has winds of 550?km/h.[60]\\r\\nCassini has observed a series of cloud features nicknamed \\"String of Pearls\\" found in northern latitudes. These features are cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud layers.[61]\\r\\nSaturn has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple, symmetric shape ÿ a magnetic dipole. Its strength at the equator ÿ 0.2?gauss (20?T) ÿ is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic field.[15] As a result, Saturn's magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter's.[63] When Voyager 2 entered the magnetosphere, the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1 million km (712,000?mi),[64] although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for about three days.[65] Most probably, the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter ÿ by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo.[63] This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun. The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn's magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan's outer atmosphere.[15] Saturn's magnetosphere, like Earth's, produces aurorae.[66]\\r\\nThe average distance between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4 billion kilometers (9?AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68?km/s,[5] it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days (or about ?29?1?2?years),[67] to finish one revolution around the Sun.[5] The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined 2.48 relative to the orbital plane of the Earth.[5] The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957?AU, on average.[5][68] The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter's case).\\r\\nAstronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. System?I has a period of 10?hr 14?min 00?sec (844.3/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to System?I. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding the north and south polar regions, are indicated as System?II and have been assigned a rotation period of 10?hr 38?min 25.4?sec (810.76/d). System?III refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a rotation period of 10?hr 39?min 22.4?sec (810.8/d). Because it is close to System?II, it has largely superseded it.[69]\\r\\nA precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive. While approaching Saturn in 2004, Cassini found that the radio rotation period of Saturn had increased appreciably, to approximately 10?hr 45?min 45?sec (I?36?sec).[70][71] The latest estimate of Saturn's rotation (as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the Cassini, Voyager and Pioneer probes was reported in September 2007 is 10?hr 32?min 35?sec.[72]\\r\\nIn March 2007, it was found that the variation of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.[73][74][75]\\r\\nSaturn has 62 known moons, 53 of which have formal names.[76][77] In addition, there is evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40ÿ500 meters in Saturn's rings,[78] which are not considered to be true moons. Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings.[79] Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous ring system of its own,[80] along with a tenuous atmosphere.[81][82][83]\\r\\nMany of the other moons are small: 34 are less than 10?km in diameter and another 14 between 10 and 50?km in diameter.[84] Traditionally, most of Saturn's moons have been named after Titans of Greek mythology. Titan is the only satellite in the Solar System with a major atmosphere,[85][86] in which a complex organic chemistry occurs. It is the only satellite with hydrocarbon lakes.[87][88]\\r\\nOn 6 June 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan, a possible precursor for life.[89] On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times.[90]\\r\\nSaturn's moon Enceladus, which seems similar in chemical makeup to comets,[91] has often been regarded as a potential habitat for microbial life.[92][93][94][95] Evidence of this possibility includes the satellite's salt-rich particles having an \\"ocean-like\\" composition that indicates most of Enceladus's expelled ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt water.[96][97][98] A 2015 flyby by Cassini through a plume on Enceladus found most of the ingredients to sustain life forms that live by methanogenesis.[99]\\r\\nIn April 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the A Ring, which was imaged by Cassini on 15 April 2013.[100]\\r\\nSaturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique.[29] The rings extend from 6,630?km to 120,700?km outward from Saturn's equator, average approximately 20?meters in thickness and are composed of 93% water ice with traces of tholin impurities and 7% amorphous carbon.[101] The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10?m.[102] While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.\\r\\nThere are two main hypotheses regarding the origin of the rings. One hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed. Some ice in the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.[103][104][105]\\r\\nIn the past, astronomers once thought the rings formed alongside the planet when it formed billions of years ago.[106] Instead, the age of these planetary rings is probably some hundreds of millions of years.[107]\\r\\nBeyond the main rings at a distance of 12 million km from the planet is the sparse Phoebe ring, which is tilted at an angle of 27 to the other rings and, like Phoebe, orbits in retrograde fashion.[108]\\r\\nSome of the moons of Saturn, including Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent them from spreading out.[109] Pan and Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn's rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses.[110]\\r\\nThere have been three main phases in the observation and exploration of Saturn. The first era was ancient observations (such as with the naked eye), before the invention of the modern telescopes. Starting in the 17th century progressively more advanced telescopic observations from Earth have been made. The other type is visitation by spacecraft, either by orbiting or flyby. In the 21st century observations continue from the Earth (or Earth-orbiting observatories) and from the Cassini orbiter at Saturn.\\r\\nSaturn has been known since prehistoric times.[111] In ancient times, it was the most distant of the known planets in the Solar System and thus a major character in various mythologies. Babylonian astronomers systematically observed and recorded the movements of Saturn.[112] In ancient Roman mythology, the god Saturnus, from which the planet takes its name, was the god of agriculture.[113] The Romans considered Saturnus the equivalent of the Greek god Cronus.[113] The Greeks had made the outermost planet sacred to Cronus,[114] and the Romans followed suit. (In modern Greek, the planet retains its ancient name Cronus??: Kronos.)[115]\\r\\nThe Greek scientist Ptolemy based his calculations of Saturn's orbit on observations he made while it was in opposition.[116] In Hindu astrology, there are nine astrological objects, known as Navagrahas. Saturn is known as \\"Shani\\" and judges everyone based on the good and bad deeds performed in life.[113][116] Ancient Chinese and Japanese culture designated the planet Saturn as the \\"earth star\\" (x). This was based on Five Elements which were traditionally used to classify natural elements.[117][118][119]\\r\\nIn ancient Hebrew, Saturn is called 'Shabbathai'.[120] Its angel is Cassiel. Its intelligence or beneficial spirit is Agiel (layga) and its spirit (darker aspect) is Zazel (lzaz). In Ottoman Turkish, Urdu and Malay, its name is 'Zuhal', derived from Arabic ???.\\r\\nSaturn's rings require at least a 15-mm-diameter telescope[121] to resolve and thus were not known to exist until Galileo first saw them in 1610.[122][123] He thought of them as two moons on Saturn's sides.[124][125] It was not until Christiaan Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted. Huygens discovered Saturn's moon Titan; Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons: Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered the gap now known as the Cassini Division.[126]\\r\\nNo further discoveries of significance were made until 1789 when William Herschel discovered two further moons, Mimas and Enceladus. The irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion, which has a resonance with Titan, was discovered in 1848 by a British team.[127]\\r\\nIn 1899 William Henry Pickering discovered Phoebe, a highly irregular satellite that does not rotate synchronously with Saturn as the larger moons do.[127] Phoebe was the first such satellite found and it takes more than a year to orbit Saturn in a retrograde orbit. During the early 20th century, research on Titan led to the confirmation in 1944 that it had a thick atmosphere ÿ a feature unique among the Solar System's moons.[128]\\r\\nPioneer 11 made the first flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within 20,000?km of the planet's cloud tops. Images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons, although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail. The spacecraft also studied Saturn's rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at high phase angle (towards the Sun), meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, Pioneer 11 measured the temperature of Titan.[129]\\r\\nIn November 1980, the Voyager 1 probe visited the Saturn system. It sent back the first high-resolution images of the planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out from the plane of the Solar System.[130]\\r\\nAlmost a year later, in August 1981, Voyager 2 continued the study of the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.[130]\\r\\nThe probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet's rings, as well as the small Maxwell Gap (a gap within the C Ring) and Keeler gap (a 42?km wide gap in the A Ring).\\r\\nOn 1 July 2004, the CassiniÿHuygens space probe performed the SOI (Saturn Orbit Insertion) maneuver and entered orbit around Saturn. Before the SOI, Cassini had already studied the system extensively. In June 2004, it had conducted a close flyby of Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data. Cassini's flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains. The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the Huygens probe on 25 December 2004. Huygens descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005, sending a flood of data during the atmospheric descent and after the landing.[131] Cassini has since conducted multiple flybys of Titan and other icy satellites.\\r\\nStarting in early 2005, scientists used Cassini to track lightning on Saturn. The power of the lightning is approximately 1,000?times that of lightning on Earth.[132]\\r\\nIn 2006, NASA reported that Cassini had found evidence of liquid water reservoirs that erupt in geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus. Images had shown jets of icy particles being emitted into orbit around Saturn from vents in the moon's south polar region. According to Andrew Ingersoll, California Institute of Technology, \\"Other moons in the Solar System have liquid-water oceans covered by kilometers of icy crust. What's different here is that pockets of liquid water may be no more than tens of meters below the surface.\\"[134] Over 100 geysers have been identified on Enceladus.[133] In May 2011, NASA scientists at an Enceladus Focus Group Conference reported that Enceladus \\"is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond Earth in the Solar System for life as we know it\\".[135][136]\\r\\nCassini photographs have led to other significant discoveries. They have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and E?rings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus.[137] In July 2006, Cassini images provided evidence of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, additional images near Titan's north pole revealed hydrocarbon seas, the largest of which is almost the size of the Caspian Sea.[138] In October 2006, the probe detected an 8,000?km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn's south pole.[139]\\r\\nFrom 2004 to 2 November 2009, the probe discovered and confirmed eight new satellites. Its primary mission ended in 2008 when the spacecraft had completed 74?orbits around the planet. The probe's mission was extended to September 2010 and then extended again to 2017, to study a full period of Saturn's seasons.[140]\\r\\nIn April 2013 Cassini sent back images of a hurricane at the planet's north pole 20 times larger than those found on Earth, with winds faster than 530?km/h.[141]\\r\\nOn 19 July 2013, \\"The Day the Earth Smiled\\", Cassini was pointed towards Earth to capture an image of the Earth and the Moon (and, as well, Venus and Mars) as part of a natural light, multi-image portrait of the entire Saturn system. It was the first time NASA informed the people of Earth that a long-distance photo was being taken in advance.[142]\\r\\nOn 15 September 2017, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft performed the \\"Grand Finale\\" of its mission: a number of passes through gaps between Saturn and Saturn's inner rings.[143][144] The atmospheric entry of Cassini ended the mission.\\r\\nThe continued exploration of Saturn is still considered to be a viable option for NASA as part of their ongoing New Frontiers program of missions. NASA previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to Saturn that included an atmospheric entry probe and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus.[145]\\r\\nSaturn is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from Earth, the other four being Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. (Uranus and occasionally 4 Vesta are visible to the naked eye in dark skies.) Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light with an apparent magnitude of usually between +1 and 0. It takes approximately 29.5 years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac. Most people will require an optical aid (very large binoculars or a small telescope) that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of Saturn's rings, in which clear resolution is present.[29][121] Twice every Saturnian year (roughly every 15 Earth years), the rings briefly disappear from view, due to the way in which they are angled and because they are so thin. Such a \\"disappearance\\" will next occur in 2025, but Saturn will be too close to the Sun for any ring-crossing observation to be possible.[146]\\r\\nSaturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at, or near, opposition, the configuration of a planet when it is at an elongation of 180, and thus appears opposite the Sun in the sky. A Saturnian opposition occurs every yearapproximately every 378 daysand results in the planet appearing at its brightest. Both the Earth and Saturn orbit the Sun on eccentric orbits, which means their distances from the Sun vary over time, and therefore so do their distances from each other, hence varying the brightness of Saturn from one opposition to the next. Saturn also appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they are more visible. For example, during the opposition of 17 December 2002, Saturn appeared at its brightest due to a favorable orientation of its rings relative to the Earth,[147] even though Saturn was closer to the Earth and Sun in late 2003.[147]\\r\\nFrom time to time Saturn is occulted by the Moon (that is, the Moon covers up Saturn in the sky). As with all the planets in the Solar System, occultations of Saturn occur in \\"seasons\\". Saturnian occultations will take place 12 or more times over a 12-month period, followed by about a five-year period in which no such activity is registered.[148] Australian astronomy experts Hill and Horner explain the seasonal nature of Saturnian occultations:\\r\\nThis is the result of the fact that the moons orbit around the Earth is tilted to the orbit of the Earth around the Sun ÿ and so most of the time, the moon will pass above or below Saturn in the sky, and no occultation will occur. It is only when Saturn lies near the point that the moons orbit crosses the \\"plane of the ecliptic\\" that occultations can happen ÿ and then they occur every time the moon swings by, until Saturn moves away from the crossing point.[148]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar System?L Local Interstellar Cloud?L Local Bubble?L Gould Belt?L Orion Arm?L Milky Way?L Milky Way subgroup?L Local Group?L Virgo Supercluster?L Laniakea Supercluster?L PiscesÿCetus Supercluster Complex?L Observable universe?L Universe\\r\\nEach arrow (L) may be read as \\"within\\" or \\"part of\\".","input":"How many times bigger is saturn than earth?"},{"output":"T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada","context":"Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor, also known as \\"The Money Fight\\"[2] and \\"The Biggest Fight in Combat Sports History\\",[3] was a professional boxing match between undefeated eleven-time five-division boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. and two-division mixed martial arts (MMA) world champion and at-the-time current UFC Lightweight Champion Conor McGregor. The match took place at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada, on August 26, 2017 at the light-middleweight weight class (154 lbs; 69.9 kgs).

On The Herd with Colin Cowherd, White openly offered to pay Mayweather $25 million to hold the proposed bout during a UFC event. He also predicted that pay-per-view viewership of the hypothetical bout could possibly rival Mayweather vs. Pacquiao.[14]\\r\\nOn March 7, 2017, Mayweather called upon McGregor to \\"sign the paper\\" and \\"make it happen\\", arguing that \\"if Conor McGregor really wants this fight to happen, stop blowing smoke up everybody's ass.\\"[15] On March 10, 2017, Mayweather stated that only a fight with McGregor would make him come out of retirement.[16] On March 16, 2017, Dana White backpedaled on his stance against a MayweatherÿMcGregor bout and said that he would not deprive McGregor of a massive payday.[17][18] On May 18, 2017, McGregor reportedly agreed to all of Mayweather's updated terms and signed the contract.[19] The official confirmation of the fight was made on June 14.[20] An international press tour was held from July 11ÿ14.[21]\\r\\nIn July 2017, IBF junior lightweight champion Gervonta Davis was reported to be going to participate in a co-main event.[22] On July 19, additional undercard details were released.[23] By that time, three names had been confirmed on the undercard, including British amateur boxer Savannah Marshall, who signed up earlier in the year with Mayweather Promotions, and Badou Jack, who stepped up to fight at light heavyweight.[24] On July 26, 2017, it was announced that former welterweight titleholder Shawn Porter would be headlining the preliminary card, facing Thomas Dulorme.[25][26] On August 17, Porter pulled out of the fight due to personal reasons, including a death in the family. He was replaced by Cuban boxer Yordenis Ugs.[27] On July 29, it was reported that Gervonta Davis would defend his IBF junior lightweight title against former WBO champion Roman 'Rocky' Martinez.[28] Martnez was dropped due to not having enough time to make the 130 pound [59?kg] limit.[29] Instead Davis has been rescheduled to fight unbeaten prospect Francisco Fonseca.[30] On August 9, 2017, it was announced that Nathan Cleverly would defend his WBA light heavyweight title against Money Team fighter Badou Jack.[31][32]\\r\\nA mural was painted in McGregor's Dublin training facility, Straight Blast Gym, depicting McGregor hitting Mayweather with a left-handed punch.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the fight was televised via Showtime pay-per-view, available through both traditional television providers and various digital services, including the Showtime PPV website and apps, and UFC.tv. Fathom Events organized public screenings at venues such as cinemas.[34][35][36] On July 10, 2017, it was announced that pricing for the PPV in the U.S. would mirror that of Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, being set at US$89.95 (with an additional $10 charge for high definition).[37]\\r\\nThe fight was called by Showtime's lead commentary team of Mauro Ranallo (play-by-play), Al Bernstein (color), and Paulie Malignaggi (color), along with ringside reporter Jim Gray.[38] Showtime produced a four-part documentary series, All Access: Mayweather vs. McGregor, focusing on the preparations for the fight.[39] Fox Sports (the television rightsholder of the UFC) provided shoulder programming for the fight, including coverage of the press tour on UFC Tonight, as well as a pre-show and preliminary card on Fox and Fox Deportes.[37]\\r\\nDue to the high demand, a large number of television providers, as well as UFC.tv, experienced technical issues with their carriage of the PPV. The main event was delayed by an hour from its projected start time in order to address these problems.[40] Following the fight, a class-action lawsuit was proposed in Oregon against Showtime Networks for unlawful trading practices and unjust enrichment, alleging that the network knowingly advertised a level of quality it was unable to deliver with the amount of bandwidth it allocated, as the plaintiff and others had experienced technical issues with the PPV stream, including errors, buffering and low video quality.[41] Showtime and the UFC stated that they were investigating their respective customer complaints, and would issue refunds on a case-by-case basis.[42]\\r\\nSky Sports Box Office held broadcasting rights to the fight in McGregor's native Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Although it was initially believed that the price would match that of the U.S. PPV, the price was set at ?24.95 (S19.95).[43] The fight was called for Sky Sports by Johnny Nelson and Carl Froch, joined by British MMA fighter and UFC analyst Dan Hardy.[44] British radio rights were held by the BBC, with Mike Costello and Steve Bunce on commentary for BBC Radio 5 Live.[45]\\r\\nIn Hispanic America, the fight aired on Fox Premium Action.[46] In Brazil, the event aired on Globosat-owned Combate.[47]\\r\\nAs with Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, it was expected that many viewers would seek unauthorized streams of the fight due to the high cost of the PPV. Showtime successfully received a preliminary injunction against the registrant of a group of 44 websites who planned to illegally stream the fight in violation of its copyrights, and all parties in active concert or participation with them.[48][49]\\r\\nIt was estimated that nearly 2.93 million viewers illegally streamed the fight, on video streaming websites and social media channels such as Facebook, YouTube and Periscope.[50][51]\\r\\nMayweather was expected to earn at least $100 million, increasing up to four times that amount upon the event achieving all its metrics.[52] McGregor was expected to earn $75 million, but both men signed NDAs barring them from publicly communicating the financial details.[53] According to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, Mayweather would earn a guaranteed purse of $100 million and McGregor was guaranteed $30 million.[54]\\r\\nOn August 23, 2017, the WBC unveiled a special belt that would go to the winner of the fight, the \\"Money Belt\\"; it is made from Italian-made alligator leather and encrusted with 3.3 pounds (1.5 kg) of 24-karat gold, 3,360 diamonds, 600 sapphires, and 300 emeralds.[55]\\r\\nOn August 16, 2017, the officials were named for the fight:[56]\\r\\nBoth athletes initially agreed to box in 10-ounce (285 g) gloves per Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) rules which require 10-ounce (285 g) gloves for boxing matches contracted over 147 pounds [67?kg] (the fight is contracted at 154 pounds [70?kg]).[57] McGregor wanted 8-ounce (225 g) gloves and Mayweather agreed, and both athletes submitted formal requests to box in 8-ounce (225 g) gloves, which was granted by the NSAC.[57]\\r\\nExperts expected that more money would be bet on the fight than any other boxing match in history; estimates ranged up to $85 million in bets.[58][59] There were six separate $1 million bets on Mayweather in Las Vegas bookmakers, but a large majority of bets overall were on the underdog, McGregor.[59]\\r\\nNevada State Athletic Commission announced the live gate for the event was $55,414,865.79 from 13,094 tickets sold and 137 complimentary tickets given out. This was far less than the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight which grossed $72 million from a paid attendance of 16,219 in 2015, despite claims from Ellerbe and Mayweather that it did more than $80 million.[60]\\r\\nSky Sports announced the fight garnered over a million PPV buys in the UK and grossed in excess of S20 million, surpassing the record set in April 2017 when Anthony Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko in front of 90,000 at the Wembley Stadium. This also meant the fight generated more buys in the UK than Mayweather-Pacquiao which took place in 2015.[61]\\r\\nAt the weigh-in, Mayweather tipped the scales at 149.5 lbs, with McGregor at 153 lbs.[62] Mayweather and McGregor entered the ring following the Irish and American national anthems; the Irish singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Imelda May performed on behalf of Conor McGregor,[63] followed by the American singer-songwriter and actress Demi Lovato, who was personally chosen by Mayweather.[64]\\r\\nMayweather was widely expected to dominate the fight early, but McGregor started strong and was ahead on the score cards for the first few rounds, due in part to Mayweather using the rope-a-dope technique liberally in the early stages.[65] As the fight progressed, McGregor weakened. In rounds 9 and 10, Mayweather landed a series of punches to McGregor's face, and referee Robert Byrd eventually called the fight in favor of Mayweather after McGregor was unable to defend himself due to fatigue.[66]\\r\\nAfter the match Mayweather stated that he had expected McGregor to be a fast starter, and had allowed him to deliver his heavy blows early.[67][68] McGregor on the other hand was disappointed by what he saw as an early stoppage, but respected the referee's decision. Former boxers such as George Foreman and Evander Holyfield expressed their impression regarding McGregor's boxing skills and the competitiveness of the fight,[69][70] with Foreman claiming that experts who criticized the fight \\"should apologize. It was competitive\\".[71] Mike Tyson gave McGregor an \\"A grade\\" for his performance, stating he was impressed.[72] The fight was lauded for its entertaining and exciting nature, especially when compared to Mayweather's most recent bouts.[73]\\r\\nMayweather announced in his post-fight interview that he had fought his final boxing match, and would retire from the sport. McGregor said in his post-fight interview that he would be willing to box again, and that he would return to mixed martial arts and the UFC.[citation needed]\\r\\nDavis failed to make weight during the August 25 weigh in, forcing the IBF to strip him of the title. The title was declared vacant, but would be still up for grabs if Fonseca secures victory.[74] Davis would go on to win by KO in the eighth round. Cleverly lost his WBA light heavyweight title to Jack in a one-sided bout which ended when the referee stopped the fight in the fifth.[75] Cleverly retired after the fight.[76]","input":"Where is floyd mayweather and conor mcgregor fighting at?"},{"output":"more than 700","context":"Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. (PPFA), or Planned Parenthood, is a nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health care in the United States and globally. It is a tax-exempt corporation under Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3)[4] and a member association of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). PPFA has its roots in Brooklyn, New York, where Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S. in 1916. Sanger founded the American Birth Control League in 1921,[5] which changed its name to Planned Parenthood in 1942.\\r\\nPlanned Parenthood consists of 159 medical and non-medical affiliates, which operate over 600 health clinics in the United States.[2][6] It partners with organizations in 12 countries globally.[2][6] The organization directly provides a variety of reproductive health services and sexual education, contributes to research in reproductive technology and advocates for the protection and expansion of reproductive rights.[3]\\r\\nPPFA is the largest single provider of reproductive health services, including abortion, in the U.S.[10] In their 2014 Annual Report, PPFA reported seeing over 2.5?million patients in over 4?million clinical visits and performing a total of nearly 9.5?million discrete services including 324,000 abortions.[13] Its combined annual revenue is US$1.3?billion, including approximately US$530?million in government funding such as Medicaid reimbursements.[3][12] Throughout its history, PPFA and its member clinics have experienced support, controversy, protests,[14] and violent attacks.[15]\\r\\nThe origins of Planned Parenthood date to October 16, 1916, when Margaret Sanger, her sister Ethel Byrne, and Fania Mindell opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S. in the Brownsville section of the New York borough of Brooklyn.[16] They distributed birth control, birth control advice, and birth control information. All three women were arrested[17][18][19] and jailed for violating provisions of the Comstock Act, accused of distributing obscene materials at the clinic. The so-called Brownsville trials brought national attention and support to their cause. Sanger and her co-defendants were convicted on misdemeanor charges, which they appealed through two subsequent appeals courts. While the convictions were not overturned,[20] the judge who issued the final ruling also modified the law to permit physician-prescribed birth control. The women's campaign led to major changes in the laws governing birth control and sex education in the United States.[21]\\r\\nIn 1921 the clinic was organized into the American Birth Control League,[5] the core of the only national birth-control organization in the U.S. until the 1960s. By 1941 it was operating 222 centers and had served 49,000 clients.[22] However, some found its title offensive and \\"against families\\", so the League began discussions for a new name.[23] In 1938, a group of private citizens organized the Citizens Committee for Planned Parenthood to aid the American Birth Control League in spreading scientific knowledge about birth control to the general public. In 1942, the League officially changed its name to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.[23]\\r\\nLargely relying on a volunteer workforce, by 1960 the Federation had provided family planning counseling in hundreds of communities across the country.[22] Planned Parenthood was one of the founding members of the International Planned Parenthood Federation when it was launched at a conference in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, in 1952.[22][24]\\r\\nBoth Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger are strongly associated with the abortion issue today.[25][26] For much of the organization's history, however, and throughout Sanger's life, abortion was illegal in the United States, and discussions of the issue were often censored.[27] During this period, Sanger ÿ like other American advocates of birth control ÿ publicly condemned abortion, arguing that it would not be needed if every woman had access to birth control.[27]\\r\\nFollowing Margaret Sanger, Alan Frank Guttmacher became president of Planned Parenthood, serving from 1962 until 1974.[28] During his tenure, the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of the original birth control pill, giving rise to new attitudes towards women's reproductive freedom.[22] Also during his presidency, Planned Parenthood lobbied the federal government to support reproductive health, culminating with President Richard Nixon's signing of Title X to provide governmental subsidies for low-income women to access family planning services.[29] The Center for Family Planning Program Development was also founded as a semi-autonomous division during this time.[30] The center became an independent organization and was renamed the Guttmacher Institute in 1977.[30]\\r\\nPlanned Parenthood began to advocate abortion law reform beginning in 1955, when the organization's medical director, Mary Calderone, convened a national conference of medical professionals on the issue. The conference was the first instance of physicians and other professionals advocating reform of the laws which criminalized abortion, and it played a key role in creating a movement for the reform of abortion laws in the United States.[27] Focusing, at first, on legalizing therapeutic abortion, Planned Parenthood became an increasingly vocal proponent of liberalized abortion laws during the 1960s, culminating in its call for the repeal of all anti-abortion laws in 1969.[31] In the years that followed, the organization played a key role in landmark abortion rights cases such as Roe v Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v Casey (1992).[26] Once abortion was legalized during the early 1970s, Planned Parenthood also began acting as an abortion provider.\\r\\nFaye Wattleton became the first African American president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1978. Wattleton, who was also the youngest president in Planned Parenthood's history, served in this role until 1992.[32][33] During her term, Planned Parenthood grew to become the seventh largest charity in the country, providing services to four million clients each year through its 170 affiliates, whose activities were spread across 50 states.[34]\\r\\nFrom 1996 to 2006, Planned Parenthood was led by Gloria Feldt.[35][36] Feldt activated the Planned Parenthood Action Fund (PPAF), the organization's political action committee, launching what was the most far reaching electoral advocacy effort in its history.[37] The PPAF serves as the nonpartisan political advocacy arm of PPFA.[38] It engages in educational and electoral activity, including legislative advocacy, voter education, and grassroots organizing to promote the PPFA mission. Feldt also launched the Responsible Choices Action Agenda, a nationwide campaign to increase services to prevent unwanted pregnancies, improve quality of reproductive care, and ensure access to safe and legal abortions.[22] Another initiative was the commencement of a \\"Global Partnership Program\\", with the aim of building a vibrant activist constituency in support of family planning.[22]\\r\\nOn February 15, 2006, Cecile Richards, the daughter of former Texas governor Ann Richards, and formerly the deputy chief of staff to the U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (the Democratic Leader in the United States House of Representatives), became president of the organization.[39] In 2012 Richards was voted one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World.[40]\\r\\nIn 1966, PPFA began awarding the Margaret Sanger Award annually to honor, in their words, \\"individuals of distinction in recognition of excellence and leadership in furthering reproductive health and reproductive rights\\". In the first year, it was awarded to four men: Carl G. Hartman, William H. Draper, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and Martin Luther King, Jr.[41][42][43][44] Later recipients have included John D. Rockefeller III, Katharine Hepburn, Jane Fonda, Hillary Clinton, and Ted Turner.[45][46][47]\\r\\nThe services provided by PPFA affiliates vary by location, with just over half of all Planned Parenthood affiliates in the United States performing abortions.[48] Services provided by PPFA include birth control and long-acting reversible contraception;[49] emergency contraception; clinical breast examinations; cervical cancer screening; pregnancy testing and pregnancy options counseling; testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections; sex education; vasectomies; LGBT services; and abortion.[50][51] Contrary to the assumption of some, Planned Parenthood conducts cancer screenings but does not provide mammograms.[52]\\r\\nIn 2013?PPFA reported seeing 2.7?million patients in 4.6?million clinical visits.[11] Roughly 16%?of its clients are teenagers.[2][53] According to PPFA, in 2014 the organization provided 3.6 million contraceptive services, 4.5?million sexually transmitted infection services, about 1?million cancer related services, over 1?million pregnancy tests and prenatal services, over 324,000 abortion services,[54] and over 100,000 other services, for a total of 9.5?million discrete services.[11] PPFA is well known for providing services to minorities and the poor;[55][56] according to PPFA, approximately four out of five of their clients have incomes at or below 150?percent of the federal poverty level.[50][57] Services for Men's Health include STD testing and treatment, vasectomy procedures, and erectile dysfunction services.[58] Education is available regarding male birth control and lowering the risk of Sexually Transmitted Diseases.[59]\\r\\nPPFA has two national offices in the United States: one in Washington, D.C., and one in New York. It has three international offices, including a hub office in London, England. It has 68 medical and related affiliates and 101 other affiliates including 34 political action committees.[3] These affiliates together operate more than 700 health centers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[2][60][61] PPFA owns about US$54?million in property, including real estate. In addition, PPFA spends a little over US$1?million per year for rented space.[3] The largest facility, a US$26?million, 78,000-square-foot (7,200-square-metre) structure, was completed in Houston, Texas, in May 2010.[62]\\r\\nPPFA's international outreach and other activities are performed by Planned Parenthood Global, a division of PPFA,[3][63] and by the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) which now consists of more than 149 Member Associations working in more than 189 countries.[64] The IPPF is further associated with International Planned Parenthood Federation affiliates in the Caribbean and the Americas[65] and IPPF European Network,[66] as well as other organizations like Family Planning Queensland, Pro Familia (Germany) and mouvement fran?ais pour le planning familial (French Movement for Family Planning). Offices are located in New York, NY; Washington, DC; Miami, FL; Guatemala City, Guatemala; Abuja, Nigeria; and Nairobi, Kenya. The organization's focus countries are Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Kenya.[67] The Bloomberg Philanthropies donated US$50?million for Planned Parenthood Global's reproductive health and family planning efforts in Tanzania, Nicaragua, Burkina Faso, Senegal and Uganda.[68] Among specific countries and territories serviced by Planned Parenthood Global's reproductive planning outreach are Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Dominican Republic, Barbados, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Guyana, Cape Verde and Samoa.[63][64]\\r\\nPlanned Parenthood has received federal funding since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed into law the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act, amending the Public Health Service Act. Title X of that law provides funding for family planning services, including contraception and family planning information. The law had support from both Republicans and Democrats.[69] Nixon described Title X funding as based on the premise that \\"no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition\\".[70]\\r\\nDonors to Planned Parenthood have included the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Buffett Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Turner Foundation, the Cullmans, and others.[71][72][73][74] The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's contributions to the organization have been specifically marked to avoid funding abortions.[71] Some donors, such as the Buffett Foundation, have supported reproductive health that can include abortion services.[71] Pro-life groups have advocated the boycott of donors to Planned Parenthood.[75] Corporate donors include CREDO Mobile.[76]\\r\\nIn the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, total revenue was US$1.3?billion: non-government health services revenue was US$305?million, government revenue (such as Medicaid reimbursements) was US$528?million, private contributions totaled US$392?million, and US$78?million came from other operating revenue.[77] According to Planned Parenthood, 59% of the group's revenue is put towards the provision of health services, while non-medical services such as sex education and public policy work make up another 15%; management expenses, fundraising, and international family planning programs account for about 16%, and 10% of the revenue in 2013ÿ2014 was not spent.[77]\\r\\nPlanned Parenthood receives over a third of its money in government grants and contracts (about US$528?million in 2014).[78][77] By law, federal funding cannot be allocated for abortions (except in rare cases),[79] but some opponents of abortion have argued that allocating money to Planned Parenthood for the provision of other medical services allows other funds to be re-allocated for abortions.[56]\\r\\nA coalition of national and local pro-life groups have lobbied federal and state governments to stop funding Planned Parenthood. As a result, federal and state legislators have proposed legislation to reduce funding levels.[79][80] Eight states??Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Utah??have enacted such proposals.[91] In some cases the courts have overturned such actions, citing conflict with federal or state laws; in others the federal executive branch has provided funding in lieu of the states.[83][84][92] In some states, Planned Parenthood was completely or partially defunded.[93][94]\\r\\nIn August 2015, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal attempted to end Louisiana's contract with Planned Parenthood to treat Medicaid patients at a time when there was an epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases in Louisiana.[57] Planned Parenthood and three patients sued the state of Louisiana, with the United States Department of Justice siding with Planned Parenthood.[95]\\r\\nOn February 2, 2016, the U.S. House failed to override President Obama's veto of H.R. 3762 which would have prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal Medicaid funds for one year.[96]\\r\\nLate in 2016, the Obama administration issued a rule effective in January 2017 banning U.S. states from withholding federal family-planning funds from health clinics that give abortions, including Planned Parenthood affiliates; this rule mandates that local and state governments give federal funds for services related to sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy care, fertility, contraception, and breast and cervical cancer screening to qualified health providers whether or not they give abortions.[97] However, this rule was blocked by a federal judge the day before it would have taken effect.[98] In 2017 it was overturned by new legislation.[99]\\r\\nThe proposed American Health Care Act, announced by Congressional Republicans in March 2017, would have made Planned Parenthood \\"ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants\\".[100]\\r\\nPlanned Parenthood is an advocate for the legal and political protection of reproductive rights.[101] This advocacy includes helping to sponsor abortion rights and women's rights events.[102] The Federation opposes restrictions on women's reproductive health services, including parental consent laws for minors.[103][104] To justify this position, Planned Parenthood has cited the case of Becky Bell, who died following an illegal abortion rather than seek parental consent for a legal one.[105][106] Planned Parenthood also takes the position that laws requiring parental notification before an abortion can be performed on a minor are unconstitutional on privacy grounds.[107]\\r\\nThe organization opposes laws requiring ultrasounds before abortions, stating that their only purpose is to make abortions more difficult to obtain.[108] Planned Parenthood has also opposed initiatives that require waiting periods before abortions,[109] and bans on late-term abortions including intact dilation and extraction, which has been illegal in the U.S. since 2003.[110] Planned Parenthood supports the wide availability of emergency contraception such as the Plan?B pill.[111] It opposes conscience clauses, which allow pharmacists to refuse to dispense drugs against their beliefs.[112] Planned Parenthood has been critical of hospitals that do not provide access to emergency contraception for rape victims.[113] Citing the need for medically accurate information in sex education, Planned Parenthood opposes abstinence-only education in public schools. Instead, Planned Parenthood is a provider of, and endorses, comprehensive sex education, which includes discussion of both abstinence and birth control.[114]\\r\\nPlanned Parenthood's advocacy activities are executed by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which is registered as a 501(c)(4) charity, and files financial information jointly with PPFA.[3] The committee was founded in 1996, by then-president Gloria Feldt, for the purpose of maintaining reproductive health rights and supporting political candidates of the same mindset. In the 2012 election cycle, the committee gained prominence based on its effectiveness of spending on candidates.[115] Although the Planned Parenthood Action Fund (PPAF) shares some leadership with the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the president of PPAF, Cecile Richards,[116][117] testified before Congress in September 2015 that she did not manage the organization.[118] The Planned Parenthood Action Fund has 58 active, separately incorporated chapters in 41 states[119] and maintains national headquarters in New York and Washington, D.C.[120] Planned Parenthood has received grants from the Obama administration to help promote the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.[121]\\r\\nPlanned Parenthood spends money on politics and elections through the Planned Parenthood Action Fund (its federal political action committee), through its Super PAC, and through a variety of related 501(c)(4) entities.[122] Planned Parenthood endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.[123][124] In the 2014 election cycle, Planned Parenthood spent US$6,587,100 on contributions to candidates and political parties (overwhelmingly to Democrats) and on independent expenditures.[122][125]\\r\\nPlanned Parenthood regional chapters have been active in the American courts. A number of cases in which Planned Parenthood has been a party have reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Notable among these cases is the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the case that sets forth the current constitutional abortion standard. In this case, \\"Planned Parenthood\\" was the Southeast Pennsylvania Chapter, and \\"Casey\\" was Robert Casey, the governor of Pennsylvania. The ultimate ruling was split, and Roe v. Wade was narrowed but upheld in an opinion written by Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter. Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens concurred with the main decision in separately written opinions. The Supreme Court struck down spousal consent requirements for married women to obtain abortions, but found no \\"undue burden\\"an alternative to strict scrutiny, which tests the allowable limitations on rights protected under the Constitutionfrom the other statutory requirements. Dissenting were William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Byron White. Blackmun, Rehnquist, and White were the only justices who voted on the original Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 who were still on the Supreme Court to rule on this case, and their votes on this case were consistent with their votes on the original decision that legalized abortion.[126] Only Blackmun voted to maintain Roe v. Wade in its entirety.[127]\\r\\nOther related cases include:\\r\\n Some state attorney generals have subpoenaed medical records of patients treated by Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood has gone to court to keep from turning over these records, citing medical privacy and concerns about the motivation for seeking the records.[136]\\r\\nIn 2006, Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline, a Republican, released some sealed patient records obtained from Planned Parenthood to the public. His actions were described as \\"troubling\\" by the state Supreme Court, but Planned Parenthood was compelled to turn over the medical records, albeit with more stringent court-mandated privacy safeguards for the patients involved.[136] In 2007 Kline's successor, Paul J. Morrison, a Democrat, notified the clinic that no criminal charges would be filed after a three-year investigation, as \\"an objective, unbiased and thorough examination\\" showed no wrongdoing. Morrison stated that he believed Kline had politicized the attorney general's office.[137] In 2012 a Kansas district attorney found that the practices of the Kansas City-area Planned Parenthood clinic were \\"within accepted practices in the medical community\\" and dropped all of the remaining criminal charges. In all, the Planned Parenthood clinic had faced 107 criminal charges from Kline and other Kansas prosecutors, all of which were ultimately dismissed.[138]\\r\\nIn 2006, the Indiana Court of Appeals ruled that Planned Parenthood was not required to turn over its medical records in an investigation of possible child abuse.[139] In 2005 Planned Parenthood Minnesota/North Dakota/South Dakota was fined US$50,000 for violating a Minnesota state parental consent law.[140]\\r\\nIn 2012, a Texas state court judge, Gary Harger, denied Planned Parenthood request for a temporary restraining order against the State of Texas, concluding that the State may exclude otherwise qualified doctors and clinics from receiving state funding if the doctors or clinics advocate for abortion rights.[141]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1920s, various theories of eugenics were popular among intellectuals in the United States. (For example, 75% of colleges offered courses on eugenics.)[142] In her campaign to promote birth control, Sanger teamed with eugenics organizations such as the American Eugenics Society, although she argued against many of their positions.[143][144] Scholars describe Sanger as believing that birth control and sterilization should be voluntary, and not based on race.[145] Sanger advocated for \\"voluntary motherhood\\"the right to choose when to be pregnantfor all women, as an important element of women's rights.[146][147] As part of her efforts to promote birth control, however, Sanger found common cause with proponents of eugenics, believing that she and they both sought to \\"assist the race toward the elimination of the unfit\\".[148]\\r\\nCritics of Planned Parenthood often refer to Sanger's connection with supporters of eugenics to discredit the organization by associating it, and birth control, with the more negative modern view of eugenics.[149][150] Planned Parenthood has responded to this effort directly in a leaflet acknowledging that Sanger agreed with some of her contemporaries who advocated the voluntary hospitalization or sterilization of people with untreatable, disabling, hereditary conditions, and limits on the immigration of the diseased. The leaflet also states that Planned Parenthood \\"finds these views objectionable and outmoded\\" but says that it was compelled to discuss the topic because \\"anti-family planning activists continue to attack Sanger?... because she is an easier target\\" than Planned Parenthood.[151]\\r\\nPlanned Parenthood has occupied a central position in the abortion debate in the U.S., and has been among the most prominent targets of the United States pro-life movement for decades. Some members of Congress, overwhelmingly Republican, have attempted since the 1980s to end federal funding of the organization,[78] nearly leading to a government shutdown over the issue in 2011.[152] Planned Parenthood has consistently maintained that federal money received by Planned Parenthood is not used to fund abortion services, but pro-life activists have argued that the federal funding frees up other resources that are, in turn, used to provide abortions.[78]\\r\\nPlanned Parenthood is the largest single provider of abortions in the U.S.,[153] but pro-choice advocates have argued that the organization's family planning services reduce the need for abortions; in the words of Megan Crepeau of the Chicago Tribune, Planned Parenthood could be \\"characterized as America's largest abortion preventer\\".[154][155] Pro-life activists dispute the evidence that greater access to contraceptives reduces abortion frequency.[156]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeriodically, pro-life advocates and activists have tried to demonstrate that Planned Parenthood does not follow applicable state or federal laws. The groups called or visited Planned Parenthood health centers posing as victims of statutory rape,[157] minors who by law need parental notification before abortion,[158] racist donors seeking to earmark donations to reduce the African-American population,[55][159] or pimps seeking abortions for underage prostitutes.[160] As a result of some of these videos, several Planned Parenthood workers have been disciplined or fired.[159][160] However, a 2005 review by the Bush administration's Department of Health and Human Services \\"yielded no evidence of clinics around the nation failing to comply with laws on reporting child abuse, child molestation, sexual abuse, rape or incest\\".[158]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 2010, Live Action has released several series of undercover videos filmed in Planned Parenthood centers. Live Action said one series showed Planned Parenthood employees at many affiliates actively assisting or being complicit in aiding a prostitution ring,[161] advising patients on how to procure sex-selective abortions,[162] while one who said they would immerse a child born alive after a botched abortion in a chemical solution to make it stop moving and breathing.[163] No criminal convictions resulted,[164] but some Planned Parenthood employees and volunteers were fired for not following procedure, and the organization committed to retraining its staff.[165] Additionally, one center was placed on probation.[166]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, an anti-abortion organization named the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) released several videos that had been secretly recorded. Members of the CMP posed as representatives of a biotechnology company in order to gain access to both meetings with abortion providers and abortion facilities. The videos showed how abortion providers made fetal tissue available to researchers, although no problems were found with the legality of the process.\\r\\nAll of the videos were found to be altered, according to analysis by Fusion GPS and its co-founder Glenn R. Simpson, a former investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal. The CMP disputed this finding, attributed the alterations to the editing out of \\"bathroom breaks and waiting periods\\". CMP continues to allege that the videos provide evidence that abortion providers profit from the sale of donated tissue. The videos attracted widespread media coverage, and after the release of the first video, conservative Congressional lawmakers singled out Planned Parenthood and began to push bills that would strip the organization of federal family planning funding. No such attempts by Congress to cut federal family planning money from Planned Parenthood have become law. Conservative politicians in several states have also used this as an opportunity to cut or attempt to cut family planning funding at the state level.\\r\\nOfficials in 12 states initiated investigations into claims made by the videos, but none found Planned Parenthood clinics to have sold tissue for profit as alleged by CMP and other anti-abortion groups. An investigation by the United States House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee found no evidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. A select committee, the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood, was formed to further investigate Planned Parenthood. The Republican-controlled Select Investigative Panel released its final report on December 30, 2016, recommending that Planned Parenthood be de-funded. The report was heavily criticized as partisan and inaccurate by Democratic members of the committee, Planned Parenthood, and some news media.\\r\\nOn January 25, 2016, a Texas grand jury indicted CMP founder David Daleiden and member Sandra Merritt while finding no wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. The charges against Daleiden and Merritt in Texas were dismissed six months later. On March 28, 2017, Daleiden and Merritt were charged with 15 felonies in the State of California - one for each of the people whom they had filmed without consent, and one for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy. On June 21, 2017, all the invasion of privacy charges (but not that of conspiracy) were dismissed with leave to amend.\\r\\nIn the U.S., abortion providers have been threatened with death, and facilities that provide abortions have been attacked or vandalized.[168][169] Planned Parenthood clinics have been the target of a number of instances of violence by anti-abortion activists, including bombing, arson and attacks with chemical weaponry.[181] In 1994, John Salvi entered a Brookline, Massachusetts Planned Parenthood clinic and opened fire, murdering receptionist Shannon Elizabeth Lowney and wounding three others. He fled to another Planned Parenthood clinic where he murdered Leane Nichols and wounded two others.[182] In 2012, a Grand Chute, Wisconsin, Planned Parenthood clinic was subject to a bombing perpetrated by an unknown individual.[169] In 2015, a Planned Parenthood clinic in Pullman, Washington was heavily damaged by arson.[183]\\r\\nOn November 27, 2015, a gunman shot and killed two civilians and a police officer during a five-hour gun battle at the Colorado Springs, Colorado clinic.[184][185][186] The 57-year-old gunman,[187] Robert Dear, surrendered to police and was taken into custody. During his arrest, he gave a \\"rambling\\" interview[188] in which, at one point, he said \\"no more baby parts\\", echoing language used in the news media about the clinic following the Center for Medical Progress videos.[189][190][191] Dear was declared incompetent to stand trial for the shooting, citing experts' finding that he suffers from \\"delusional disorder, persecutory type.\\"[192]","input":"How many planned parenthood locations are there in the united states?"},{"output":"acts as a simple diluent to reduce oxygen concentration in inspired gas and blood to dangerously low levels, thereby eventually depriving all cells in the body of oxygen","context":"Inert gas asphyxiation is a form of asphyxiation which results from breathing a physiologically inert gas in the absence of oxygen, or a low amount of oxygen,[1] rather than atmospheric air (which is largely composed of nitrogen and oxygen). Examples of physiologically inert gases, which have caused accidental or deliberate death by this mechanism, are argon, helium, nitrogen and methane. The term \\"physiologically inert\\" is used to indicate a gas which has no toxic or anesthetic properties and does not act upon the heart or hemoglobin. Instead, the gas acts as a simple diluent to reduce oxygen concentration in inspired gas and blood to dangerously low levels, thereby eventually depriving all cells in the body of oxygen.[2]\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, in humans, \\"breathing an oxygen deficient atmosphere can have serious and immediate effects, including unconsciousness after only one or two breaths. The exposed person has no warning and cannot sense that the oxygen level is too low.\\" In the US, at least 80 people died due to accidental nitrogen asphyxiation between 1992 and 2002.[3] Hazards with inert gases and the risks of asphyxiation are well established.[4]\\r\\nAn occasional cause of accidental death in humans, inert gas asphyxia with gases including helium, nitrogen, methane, and argon, has been used as a suicide method. Inert gas asphyxia has been advocated by proponents of euthanasia, using a gas-retaining plastic hood device colloquially referred to as a suicide bag.\\r\\nNitrogen asphyxiation has been suggested by a number of lawmakers and other advocates as a more humane way to carry out capital punishment. In April 2015, the Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed a bill authorizing nitrogen asphyxiation as an alternative execution method in cases where the state's preferred method of lethal injection was not available as an option.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen humans breathe in an asphyxiant gas, such as pure nitrogen, helium, neon, argon, sulfur hexafluoride, methane, or any other physiologically inert gas(es), they exhale carbon dioxide without re-supplying oxygen. Physiologically inert gases (those that have no toxic effect, but merely dilute oxygen) are generally free of odor and taste. As such, the human subject detects little abnormal sensation as the oxygen level falls. This leads to asphyxiation (death from lack of oxygen) without the painful and traumatic feeling of suffocation (the hypercapnic alarm response, which in humans arises mostly from carbon dioxide levels rising), or the side effects of poisoning. In scuba diving rebreather accidents, there is often little sensation but euphoriahowever, a slow decrease in oxygen breathing gas content has effects which are quite variable.[7] By contrast, suddenly breathing pure inert gas causes oxygen levels in the blood to fall precipitously, and may lead to unconsciousness in only a few breaths, with no symptoms at all.[3]\\r\\nSome animal species are better equipped than humans to detect hypoxia, and these species are more uncomfortable in low-oxygen environments that result from inert gas exposure.[8]\\r\\nA typical human breathes between 12 and 20 times per minute at a rate primarily influenced by carbon dioxide concentration, and thus pH, in the blood. With each breath, a volume of about 0.6 litres is exchanged from an active lung volume (tidal volume + functional residual capacity) of about 3 litres. Normal Earth atmosphere is about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases. After just two or three breaths of nitrogen, the oxygen concentration in the lungs would be low enough for some oxygen already in the bloodstream to exchange back to the lungs and be eliminated by exhalation.\\r\\nUnconsciousness in cases of accidental asphyxia can occur within 1 minute. Loss of consciousness results from critical hypoxia, when arterial oxygen saturation is less than 60%.[9] \\"At oxygen concentrations [in air] of 4 to 6%, there is loss of consciousness in 40 seconds and death within a few minutes\\".[10] At an altitude over 43,000?ft (13,000?m), where the ambient oxygen concentration is equivalent to 3.6% at sea level, an average individual can perform flying duties efficiently for only 9 to 12 seconds without oxygen supplementation.[9] The US Air Force trains air crews to recognize their individual subjective signs of approaching hypoxia. Some individuals experience headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, euphoria and some become unconscious without warning.[9]\\r\\nLoss of consciousness may be accompanied by convulsions[9] and is followed by cyanosis and cardiac arrest. About 7 minutes of oxygen deprivation causes death of the brainstem.[citation needed]\\r\\nControlled atmosphere killing (CAK) or controlled atmosphere stunning (CAS) is a method for slaughtering animals such as chickens by placing the animals in a container in which the atmosphere lacks oxygen and consists of an asphyxiant gas (one or more of argon, nitrogen or carbon dioxide), causing the animals to lose consciousness. Argon and nitrogen are important components of a gassing process which seem to cause no pain, and for this reason many consider some types of controlled atmosphere killing more humane than other methods of killing.[11][12] If carbon dioxide is used, controlled atmosphere killing is not the same as inert gas asphyxia, because carbon dioxide at high concentrations (above 5%) is not biologically inert, but rather is toxic and also produces initial distress in a number of animal species[citation needed]. The addition of toxic carbon dioxide to hypoxic atmospheres used in slaughter without animal distress is a complex and highly species-specific matter, which also depends on concentration of carbon dioxide.[13][14][15]\\r\\nDiving animals such as mink and burrowing animals, such as rodents and rats, are sensitive to low-oxygen atmospheres and (unlike humans) will avoid them, making purely hypoxic techniques possibly inhumane[citation needed] for them. For this reason, the use of inert gas (hypoxic) atmospheres (without CO2) for euthanasia, is also species-specific.[8][16]\\r\\nAccidental nitrogen asphyxiation is a possible hazard where large quantities of nitrogen are used.\\r\\nAccidental nitrogen asphyxiation causes about eight deaths per year in the United States,[17] which is asserted to be more than from any other industrial gas. This figure comes from the fact that some 80 people were recorded killed in such accidents from 1992 to 2002.\\r\\nIn a notable accident in 1981, shortly before the launch of the first Space Shuttle mission, five technicians lost consciousness and two of them died after they entered the Orbiter aft compartment. Nitrogen had been used to flush oxygen from the compartment as a precaution against fire. They were not wearing air packs because of a last minute change in safety procedures.[18]\\r\\nA laboratory assistant died in Scotland in 1999, apparently from asphyxiation, after liquid nitrogen spilled in a basement storage room.[19]\\r\\nDuring a pool party in Mexico in 2013, 8 party-goers were rendered unconscious and one 21-year-old male was put into a coma after liquid nitrogen was poured into the pool.[20][21]\\r\\nOccasional deaths are reported from recreational inhalation of helium, but these are very rare from direct inhalation from small balloons. The inhalation from larger helium balloons has been reportedly fatal.[22] A fatal accidental fall from a tree occurred after the inhalation of helium from a toy balloon, which caused the person to become either unconscious or light headed.[23]\\r\\nIn 2015, a technician at a health spa was asphyxiated while conducting unsupervised cryotherapy using nitrogen.[24][25]\\r\\nUse of inert gas for suicide was first proposed by a Canadian, Dr Bruce Dunn.[26] Dunn commented that, \\"...the acquisition of a compressed gas cylinder, an appropriate pressure reducing regulator, and suitable administration equipment... [was] \\"not inaccessible to a determined individual, but relatively difficult for a member of the public to acquire casually or quickly.\\"[27] Dunn collaborated with other researchers, notably the Canadian campaigner, John Hofsess, who in 1997 formed the group \\"NuTech\\" with Derek Humphry and Philip Nitschke.[28] Two years later, NuTech had streamlined Dunn's work by using readily-available party balloon cylinders of helium.[29]\\r\\nThe method of suicide based on self-administration of helium in a bag, a colloquial name being the \\"exit bag\\" or suicide bag, has been referenced by some medical euthanasia advocacy groups.[30] Originally such bags were used with helium, and 30 deaths were reported with use of them from 2001 to 2005, and another 79 from 2005 to 2009. This suggested to one set of reviewers that the popularity of the technique was increasing, as also did the increase in helium suicides in Sweden during the latter half of the same decade.[31]\\r\\nAfter attempts were made by authorities to control helium sales in Australia, a new method was introduced that instead uses nitrogen.[32] Nitrogen became the main gas promoted by euthanasia advocates, such as Philip Nitschke, who founded a company called Max Dog Brewing in order to import canisters of nitrogen into Australia.[33] Nitschke stated that the gas cylinders can be used for both brewing and, if required, to end life at a later stage in a \\"peaceful, reliable [and] totally legal\\" manner.[34] Nitschke said, \\"[nitrogen] was undetectable even by autopsy, which was important to some people\\".[35]\\r\\nAfter a number of accidents in which humans suffocated in nitrogen without any warning, the suggestion was made[who?] in 1995 that hypoxic atmospheres might be used for a more humane form of execution.[citation needed]\\r\\nExecution by nitrogen asphyxiation was discussed briefly in print as a theoretical method of capital punishment in a National Review article, \\"Killing with kindness?ÿ capital punishment by nitrogen asphyxiation\\".[36] The idea was then proposed by Lawrence J. Gist II, an attorney at law, under the title, International Humanitarian Hypoxia Project.[37]\\r\\nIn a televised documentary in 2007, the British political commentator and former MP Michael Portillo examined execution techniques in use around the world and found them unsatisfactory; his conclusion was that nitrogen asphyxiation would be the best method.[38]\\r\\nIn April 2015, Governor Mary Fallin of Oklahoma signed a bill allowing nitrogen asphyxiation as an alternative execution method.[5] Three years later, in March 2018, Oklahoma announced that, due to the difficulty in procuring lethal injection drugs, Nitrogen gas would be its primary method of carrying out executions.[39] In March of 2018, Alabama became the third state (along with Oklahoma and Mississippi), to authorize the use of nitrogen asphyxiation as a method of execution.[40]","input":"What does nitrogen gas do to your body?"},{"output":"The peel","context":"Peel, also known as rind or skin, is the outer protective layer of a fruit or vegetable which can be peeled off.

The continent mainly lies within the intertropical zone between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Hence, its interesting density of humidity intensity is always high, and it is a hot continent. Warm and hot climates prevail all over Africa,  but the northern part is that most marked by aridity and high temperatures. Only the northernmost and the southernmost fringes of the continent have a Mediterranean climate.The equator runs through the middle of Africa, as do the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, making Africa the most tropical continent.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe climate of Africa is a range of climates such as the equatorial climate, the tropical wet and dry climate, the tropical monsoon climate, the semi-desert climate (semi-arid), the desert climate (hyper-arid and arid), the subtropical highland climate etc. Temperate climates are rare across the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes. In fact, the climate of Africa is more variable by rainfall amount than by temperatures, which are consistently high. African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent, owing to the prevailing presence of the subtropical ridge with subsiding, hot, dry air masses. Africa holds many heat-related records: the continent has the hottest extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, the highest sunshine duration etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobally, heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the monsoon trough or Intertropical Convergence Zone. The divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft. As it moves towards the Mid-Latitudes, the air cools and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres. This circulation is known as the Hadley cell and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.[1]  Many of the world's deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure areas,[2] including the Sahara Desert.\\r\\n\\r\\nTemperatures are hottest within the Sahara regions of Algeria and Mali,[3] and coolest across the south and at elevation within the topography across the eastern and northwest sections of the continent. The hottest average temperature on Earth is at Dallol, Ethiopia, which averages a temperature of 33.9?C (93.0?F) throughout the year.[4] The hottest temperature recorded within Africa, which was also the world record, was 57.8?C (136.0?F) at 'Aziziya, Libya on September 13, 1922. This was later proven to be false, and to derive from an inaccurate reading of a thermometer. The world's hottest place is in fact Death Valley, in California.[5][6][7] Apparent temperatures, combining the effect of the temperature and humidity, along the Red Sea coast of Eritrea and Gulf of Aden coast of Somalia range between 57?C (135?F) and 63?C (145?F) during the afternoon hours.[3] The lowest temperature measured within Africa was ?24?C (?11?F) at Ifrane, Morocco on February 11, 1935.[5] Nevertheless, the major part of Africa experiences extreme heat during much of the year, especially the deserts, steppes and savannas. The African deserts are arguably the hottest places on Earth, especially the Sahara Desert and the Danakil Desert, located in the Horn of Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe low-level easterly African jet stream is considered to play a crucial role in the southwest monsoon of Africa,[8] and helps form the tropical waves which march across the tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans during the warm season.[9] The jet exhibits both barotropic and baroclinic instability, which produces synoptic-scale, westward-propagating disturbances in the jet known as African easterly waves, or tropical waves. A small number of mesoscale storm systems embedded in these waves develop into tropical cyclones after they move from west Africa into the tropical Atlantic, mainly during August and September. When the jet lies south of normal during the peak months of the Atlantic hurricane season, tropical cyclone formation is suppressed.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat parts of North Africa and Southern Africa as well as the whole Horn of Africa mainly have a hot desert climate, or a hot semi-arid climate for the wetter locations. The Sahara Desert in North Africa is the largest hot desert in the world and is one of the hottest, driest and sunniest places on Earth. Located just south of the Sahara is a narrow steppe (a semi-arid region) called the Sahel, while Africa's most southern areas contain both savanna plains, and its central portion contains very dense jungle (rainforest) regions. The equatorial region near the Intertropical Convergence Zone is the wettest portion of the continent.  Annually, the rain belt across the country moves northward into Sub-Saharan Africa by August, then passes back southward into south-central Africa by March.[11] Areas with a savannah climate in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Ghana, Burkina Faso,[12][13] Darfur,[14] Eritrea,[15] Ethiopia,[16] and Botswana have a distinct rainy season.[17] El Nino results in drier-than-normal conditions in Southern Africa from December to February, and wetter-than-normal conditions in equatorial East Africa over the same period.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Madagascar, trade winds bring moisture up the eastern slopes of the island, which is deposited as rainfall, and bring drier downsloped winds to areas south and west, leaving the western sections of the island in a rain shadow. This leads to significantly more rainfall over northeast sections of Madagascar than its southwestern portions.[19] Southern Africa receives most of its rainfall from summer convective storms and with extratropical cyclones moving through the Westerlies. Once a decade, tropical cyclones lead to excessive rainfall across the region.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow is an almost annual occurrence on some of the mountains of South Africa, including those of the Cedarberg and around Ceres in the South-Western Cape, and on the Drakensberg in Natal and Lesotho.

Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.\\r\\nAlthough oil paint was first used for Buddhist paintings by Indian and Chinese painters in western Afghanistan sometime between the fifth and tenth centuries,[1] it did not gain popularity until the 15th century. Its practice may have migrated westward during the Middle Ages. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with Early Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe, and by the height of the Renaissance oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the use of tempera paints in the majority of Europe.\\r\\nIn recent years, water miscible oil paint has come to prominence and, to some extent, replaced traditional oil paint. Water-soluble paints contain an emulsifier that allows them to be thinned with water rather than paint thinner, and allows very fast drying times (1ÿ3 days) when compared with traditional oils (1ÿ3 weeks).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional oil painting techniques often begin with the artist sketching the subject onto the canvas with charcoal or thinned paint. Oil paint is usually mixed with linseed oil, artist grade mineral spirits, or other solvents to make the paint thinner, faster or slower-drying. (Because these solvents thin the oil in the paint, they can also be used to clean paint brushes.) A basic rule of oil paint application is 'fat over lean', meaning that each additional layer of paint should contain more oil than the layer below to allow proper drying. If each additional layer contains less oil, the final painting will crack and peel. This rule does not ensure permanence; it is the quality and type of oil that leads to a strong and stable paint film. There are many other media that can be used with the oil, including cold wax, resins, and varnishes. These additional media can aid the painter in adjusting the translucency of the paint, the sheen of the paint, the density or 'body' of the paint, and the ability of the paint to hold or conceal the brushstroke. These aspects of the paint are closely related to the expressive capacity of oil paint.\\r\\nTraditionally, paint was transferred to the painting surface using paintbrushes, but there are other methods, including using palette knives and rags. Oil paint remains wet longer than many other types of artists' materials, enabling the artist to change the color, texture or form of the figure. At times, the painter might even remove an entire layer of paint and begin anew. This can be done with a rag and some turpentine for a time while the paint is wet, but after a while the hardened layer must be scraped. Oil paint dries by oxidation, not evaporation, and is usually dry to the touch within a span of two weeks (some colors dry within days). It is generally dry enough to be varnished in six months to a year.\\r\\nAlthough the history of tempera (pigment mixed with either egg whites or egg yolks, then painted on a plastered section) and related media in Europe indicates that oil painting was discovered there independently, there is evidence that oil painting was used earlier in Afghanistan.[2][3][4][5] Outdoor surfaces and surfaces like shieldsboth those used in tournaments and those hung as decorationswere more durable when painted in oil-based media than when painted in the traditional tempera paints.\\r\\nMost Renaissance sources, in particular Vasari, credited northern European painters of the 15th century, and Jan van Eyck in particular, with the \\"invention\\" of painting with oil media on wood panel supports (\\"support\\" is the technical term for the underlying backing of a painting). However, Theophilus (Roger of Helmarshausen?) clearly gives instructions for oil-based painting in his treatise, On Various Arts, written in 1125. At this period, it was probably used for painting sculptures, carvings and wood fittings, perhaps especially for outdoor use. However, early Netherlandish painting in the 15th century was the first to make oil the usual painting medium, and explore the use of layers and glazes, followed by the rest of Northern Europe, and only then Italy.\\r\\nEarly works were still panel paintings on wood, but around the end of the 15th century canvas became more popular as the support, as it was cheaper, easier to transport, allowed larger works, and did not require complicated preliminary layers of gesso (a fine type of plaster). Venice, where sail-canvas was easily available, was a leader in the move to canvas. Small cabinet paintings were also made on metal, especially copper plates. These supports were more expensive but very firm, allowing intricately fine detail. Often printing plates from printmaking were reused for this purpose. The popularity of oil spread through Italy from the North, starting in Venice in the late 15th century. By 1540, the previous method for painting on panel (tempera) had become all but extinct, although Italians continued to use chalk-based fresco for wall paintings, which was less successful and durable in damper northern climates.\\r\\nThe linseed oil itself comes from the flax seed, a common fiber crop. Linen, a \\"support\\" for oil painting (see relevant section), also comes from the flax plant. Safflower oil or the walnut or poppyseed oil are sometimes used in formulating lighter colors like white because they \\"yellow\\" less on drying than linseed oil, but they have the slight drawback of drying more slowly and may not provide the strongest paint film. Linseed oil tends to dry yellow and can change the hue of the color.\\r\\nRecent advances in chemistry have produced modern water miscible oil paints that can be used and cleaned up with water. Small alterations in the molecular structure of the oil creates this water miscible property.\\r\\nAn even newer type of paint, heat-set \\"oils\\" (which are actually thermoplastic) remain liquid until heated to 265ÿ280?F (130ÿ138?C) for about 15 minutes. Since the paint otherwise never dries, cleanup is not needed (except when one wants to use a different color with the same brush). Although not technically true oils (the medium is an unidentified \\"non-drying synthetic oily liquid, embedded with a heat sensitive curing agent\\"), the paintings made with this paint resemble oil paintings and are usually shown as such.[1]\\r\\nTraditional artists' canvas is made from linen, but less expensive cotton fabric has gained popularity. The artist first prepares a wooden frame called a \\"stretcher\\" or \\"strainer\\". The difference between the two names is that stretchers are slightly adjustable, while strainers are rigid and lack adjustable corner notches. The canvas is then pulled across the wooden frame and tacked or stapled tightly to the back edge. Then the artist applies a \\"size\\" to isolate the canvas from the acidic qualities of the paint. Traditionally, the canvas was coated with a layer of animal glue (modern painters will use rabbit skin glue) as the size and primed with lead white paint, sometimes with added chalk. Panels were prepared with a gesso, a mixture of glue and chalk.\\r\\nModern acrylic \\"gesso\\" is made of titanium dioxide with an acrylic binder. It is frequently used on canvas, whereas real gesso is not suitable for canvas. The artist might apply several layers of gesso, sanding each smooth after it has dried. Acrylic gesso is very difficult to sand. One manufacturer makes a \\"sandable\\" acrylic gesso, but it is intended for panels only and not canvas. It is possible to make the gesso a particular color, but most store-bought gesso is white. The gesso layer, depending on its thickness, will tend to draw the oil paint into the porous surface. Excessive or uneven gesso layers are sometimes visible in the surface of finished paintings as a change that's not from the paint.\\r\\nStandard sizes for oil paintings were set in France in the 19th century. The standards were used by most artists, not only the French, as it wasand evidently still issupported by the main suppliers of artists' materials. Size 0 (toile de 0) to size 120 (toile de 120) is divided in separate \\"runs\\" for figures (figure), landscapes (paysage) and marines (marine) that more or less preserve the diagonal. Thus a 0 figure corresponds in height with a paysage 1 and a marine 2.[6]\\r\\nAlthough surfaces like linoleum, wooden panel, paper, slate, pressed wood, Masonite, and cardboard have been used, the most popular surface since the 16th century has been canvas, although many artists used panel through the 17th century and beyond. Panel is more expensive, heavier, harder to transport, and prone to warp or split in poor conditions. For fine detail, however, the absolute solidity of a wooden panel has an advantage.\\r\\nOil paint is made by mixing pigments of colors with an oil medium. Different colors are made, or purchased premixed, before painting begins, but further shades of color are usually obtained by mixing small quantities together as the painting process is underway. An artist's palette, traditionally a thin wood board held in the hand, is used for holding and mixing paints of different colors. Pigments may be any number of natural or synthetic substances with color, such as sulphides for yellow or cobalt salts for blue. Traditional pigments were based on minerals or plants, but many have proven unstable over long periods of time; the appearance of many old paintings today is very different from the original. Modern pigments often use synthetic chemicals. The pigment is mixed with oil, usually linseed, but other oils may be used. The various oils dry differently, which creates assorted effects.\\r\\nTraditionally, artists mixed their own paints from raw pigments that they often ground themselves and medium. This made portability difficult and kept most painting activities confined to the studio. This changed in the 1800s, when tubes of oil paint became widely available following the American portrait painter John Goffe Rand's invention of the squeezable or collapsible metal tube in 1841 (the year of Claude Monet's birth). Artists could mix colors quickly and easily, which enabled, for the first time, relatively convenient plein air painting (a common approach in French Impressionism).\\r\\nA brush is most commonly employed by the artist to apply the paint, often over a sketched outline of their subject (which could be in another medium). Brushes are made from a variety of fibers to create different effects. For example, brushes made with hog bristle might be used for bolder strokes and impasto textures. Fitch hair and mongoose hair brushes are fine and smooth, and thus answer well for portraits and detail work. Even more expensive are red sable brushes (weasel hair). The finest quality brushes are called \\"kolinsky sable\\"; these brush fibers are taken from the tail of the Siberian weasel. This hair keeps a superfine point, has smooth handling, and good memory (it returns to its original point when lifted off the canvas), known to artists as a brush's \\"snap.\\" Floppy fibers with no snap, such as squirrel hair, are generally not used by oil painters.\\r\\nIn the past few decades, many synthetic brushes have been marketed. These are very durable and can be quite good, as well as cost efficient. Brushes come in many sizes and are used for different purposes. The type of brush also makes a difference. For example, a \\"round\\" is a pointed brush used for detail work. \\"Flat\\" brushes are used to apply broad swaths of color. \\"Bright\\" is a flat brush with shorter brush hairs. \\"Filbert\\" is a flat brush with rounded corners. \\"Egbert\\" is a very long, and rare, filbert brush. The artist might also apply paint with a palette knife, which is a flat metal blade. A palette knife may also be used to remove paint from the canvas when necessary. A variety of unconventional tools, such as rags, sponges, and cotton swabs, may be used to apply or remove paint. Some artists even paint with their fingers.\\r\\nMost oil painters paint in layers known as \\"glazes\\", a method also simply called \\"indirect painting\\". This method was first perfected through an adaptation of the egg tempera painting technique, and was applied by the Flemish painters in Northern Europe with pigments ground in linseed oil. More recently, this approach has been called the \\"mixed technique\\" or \\"mixed method\\". The first coat (the underpainting) is laid down, often painted with egg tempera or turpentine-thinned paint. This layer helps to \\"tone\\" the canvas and to cover the white of the gesso. Many artists use this layer to sketch out the composition. This first layer can be adjusted before proceeding further, an advantage over the \\"cartooning\\" method used in fresco technique. After this layer dries, the artist might then proceed by painting a \\"mosaic\\" of color swatches, working from darkest to lightest. The borders of the colors are blended together when the \\"mosaic\\" is completed, and then left to dry before applying details.\\r\\nArtists in later periods, such as the Impressionist era (late 19th century), often expanded on this wet-on-wet method, blending the wet paint on the canvas without following the Renaissance-era approach of layering and glazing. This method is also called \\"alla prima\\". This method was created due to the advent of painting outdoors, instead of inside a studio, because while outside, an artist did not have the time to let each layer of paint dry before adding a new layer. Several contemporary artists use a combination of both techniques to add bold color (wet-on-wet) and obtain the depth of layers through glazing.\\r\\nWhen the image is finished and has dried for up to a year, an artist often seals the work with a layer of varnish that is typically made from dammar gum crystals dissolved in turpentine. Such varnishes can be removed without disturbing the oil painting itself, to enable cleaning and conservation. Some contemporary artists decide not to varnish their work, preferring the surface unvarnished.\\r\\nArnolfini Portrait, Jan van Eyck, 1434 (on panel)\\r\\nLa donna velata, Raphael, 1516\\r\\nThe Rape of Europa, Titian, 1562\\r\\nThe Raising of the Cross, Peter Paul Rubens, 1610ÿ11\\r\\nThe Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, Rembrandt, 1632\\r\\nInnocent X, Velzquez, c 1650\\r\\nThe Milkmaid, Johannes Vermeer, 1658-1660\\r\\nThe Toilet of Venus, Fran?ois Boucher, 1751\\r\\nThe Blue Boy, Thomas Gainsborough, 1770\\r\\nBattle of Somosierra, Piotr Micha?owski, 1837\\r\\nWoman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son, Claude Monet, 1875\\r\\nBal du moulin de la Galette, Pierre-Auguste Renoir 1876\\r\\nPortrait of Dr. Gachet, Vincent van Gogh, 1890\\r\\nThe Cardplayers, Paul Czanne, 1892\\r\\nThe Old Guitarist, Pablo Picasso, 1903\\r\\nLes Demoiselles d'Avignon, Pablo Picasso, 1907\\r\\nComposition VII, Wassily Kandinsky, 1913\\r\\nBella with White Collar, Marc Chagall, 1917","input":"What type of paper is used for oil painting?"},{"output":"Tetris","context":"This is a list of the best-selling video games of all time.

The high school diploma is typically studied for over the course of four years, from Grade 9 to Grade 12. The diploma is typically awarded by the school in accordance with the requirements of the local state or provincial government. Requirements for earning the diploma vary by jurisdiction, and there may be different requirements for different streams or levels of high school graduation. Typically they include a combination of selected coursework meeting specified criteria for a particular stream and acceptable passing grades earned on the state exit examination.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn British Columbia, the  diploma is known as the British Columbia Certificate of Graduation. The province of BC has two distinct graduation programs:  the BC Certificate of Graduation (Dogwood Diploma) and the BC Adult Graduation Diploma (Adult Dogwood).  Students also have the opportunity to meet their educational goals (other than graduation) through the BC School Completion Certificate (Evergreen Certificate).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Dogwood requirements have been in place since July 1, 2004.[1]  Under current regulations, students must earn a minimum of 80 credits to graduate, which must include 48 credits for required courses, a minimum of 28 elective credits, and 4 credits for \\"graduation transitions\\", a standards-based assessment evaluated by schools under BC Ministry of Education guidelines.[1]  Required courses include, among other things, language arts, social studies, mathematics, and science courses in grades 10, 11, and 12.  Part of the evaluation of students includes standardized provincial examinations in a number of the required courses in grades 10 and 12.  As part of the 80 credits for the Dogwood, 16 credits must be at the Grade 12 level, and must include English 12 or Communications 12.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ontario, the high school diploma is known as the Ontario Secondary School Diploma. The diploma is awarded to all students who complete the Ontario educational curriculum. The requirements for the diploma include compulsory credits in English or French, Mathematics, Science, Canadian History, Canadian  Geography, Arts, Health and Physical Education, and a second language; compulsory half credits in Career Studies and Civics; one credit each from three elective groups; 12 optional credits, 4 of which may be obtained through dual-credit classes; 40 hours of community service; and the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test.

Also required for graduation is successful completion with passing grades on the Exit Level examination of the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR), which is typically taken in Grade 11. Multiple re-sits for the exam are available, in case of failure on a previous attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents in the Recommended and Distinguished programs must take four years of English, mathematics, science, and social studies classes as part of their program of study.[8] Students in the Distinguished program must also take a minimum amount of advanced-level coursework, which could include Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate classes or university classes taken as dual-enrollment. Students in the Minimum program have less stringent requirements to complete their diploma than students in the other diploma programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Texas state law, completion of the Recommended or Distinguished programs or a program with an equivalent curriculum and level of rigor, along with suitable scores on the SAT or the ACT, is required for a student to be eligible to be considered for admission to a four-year public institution of higher education in Texas.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe General Education Development (GED) credential is offered as an alternative qualification for those who did not successfully earn a high school diploma. Examination involves taking and passing tests in five subjects: Reading, Writing, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. A Certificate of High School Equivalency is generally offered to those who successfully complete the GED. While the GED itself may not necessarily enable the same higher education and employment opportunities as the high school diploma, the GED can enhance employability prospects for former high school dropouts, and progression is available to tertiary study at select higher education institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIB World Schools may offer the IB Diploma[10] in lieu of or alongside a traditional high school diploma. The IB Diploma is an academically rigorous program of study. The program of study for the IB Diploma includes subjects chosen from five subject groups: Studies in Language and Literature, Language Acquisition, Individuals and Societies, Sciences, Mathematics, and the Arts.[10][11] Three subjects are taken at Higher Level, and three are taken at Standard Level.[10][11] Also included is the Diploma Programme Core, which is composed of Extended Essay; Theory of Knowledge; and Creativity, Action, and Service (CAS) components.[10][11] The IB Diploma is an internationally recognized academic school-leaving qualification that provides entry to, and in some cases, advanced standing in, university. International Baccalaureate (IB) exams are typically considered equivalent to Advanced Placement (AP) exams and are at an academic level above the high school diploma, and thus university credit may be awarded for successful completion of IB subjects by American and Canadian universities as well as Universities around the World.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational schools following the British Curriculum of education may offer the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) qualification, which is considered to be at the same level, in lieu of or alongside a traditional high school diploma. The IGCSE is the international counterpart to the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) qualification, taken by secondary school students at Key Stage 4 in the United Kingdom. Edexcel and Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) are examination boards which offer the IGCSE qualification worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents generally take five to ten subjects, according to their desired program of study and the offerings available at their school; an IGCSE with eight subjects at grades A*-C is considered equivalent to the full high school diploma. Unlike the high school diploma, which is typically studied for in years 9-12 and awarded in year 12, the IGCSE is typically awarded at year 11, after which the A Levels are studied for and awarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing successful completion of the GCSE or IGCSE, international schools following the British Curriculum may offer the Cambridge Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE) Diploma, developed by the Cambridge International Examinations board.[12] As part of the Cambridge AICE Diploma program, students take a combination of Cambridge International AS Level and A Level subjects, administered by Cambridge International Examinations with at least one subject taken in each of three subject areas: Mathematics and Science, Languages, and Arts and Humanities; subjects from a fourth subject group, Global Perspecties, may also be chosen.[12] Six credits must be earned to achieve the Diploma; an AS Level counts as a full (single) credit, and an A Level counts as a double credit.[12] The Cambridge AICE Diploma would typically be completed by the final year of high school. AS and A Levels are at a higher academic level than the high school diploma, and thus university credit may be awarded for A Levels completed as part of the Cambridge AICE Diploma by American and Canadian Universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an alternative to the Cambridge AICE Diploma, international schools following the British Curriculum may offer the Edexcel International Diploma (ID), in lieu of or alongside the traditional high school diploma, following successful completion of the GCSE or IGCSE.[13] The International Diploma requires successful completion of three Edexcel A Levels or three BTEC Level 3 Extended Diplomas, along with a Level 3 Extended Project (EPQ), a BTEC Level 3 WorkSkills Plus Certificate, and an Edexcel AS Level in General Studies.[13] This qualification thus allows for a blended mix of academic studies and vocational training, to prepare students for higher education as well as the workplace.[13] The Edexcel International Diploma would typically be completed by the final year of high school. AS and A Levels are at a higher academic level than the high school diploma, and thus university credit may be awarded for A Levels completed as part of the International Diploma by American and Canadian universities .\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational schools following the French Curriculum of education may offer the Baccalaurat (Le Bac) in lieu of or alongside a traditional high school diploma. The Baccalaurat is the traditional school-leaving qualification of French schools. The Baccalaurat is offered in several streams; subjects chosen for the Baccalaurat depend on the stream chosen by the student.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccredited French international schools in the United States may also offer the Baccalaurat Franco Amricain (French American Baccalaurat), as an alternative to the traditional Baccalaurat, in lieu of or alongside a traditional high school diploma.[14][15] The French American Baccalaurat is offered as a joint initiative of the College Board and the French Ministry of Education.[14][15] The curriculum includes Advanced Placement (AP) subjects and French classes; in lieu of three French classes, students take three corresponding AP classes in the premire (year 11) and terminale (year 12) years of high school.[14][15] AP exams are taken in May of year 11 or year 12, and French Baccalaurat exams are taken according to the normal academic calendar.[14][15] Students may elect to take the Baccalaurat Franco Amricain in the Literature (L), Economics (ES), and Science (S) courses of study.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn England and Wales, the high school diploma is considered to be at the level of the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), which is awarded at Year 11.[16][17] For college and university admissions, the high school diploma may be accepted in lieu of the GCSE if an average grade of C is obtained in subjects with a GCSE counterpart.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the more academically rigorous A Levels awarded at Year 13 are expected for university admission, the high school diploma alone is generally not considered to meet university requirements. Students who wish to study in the United Kingdom may additionally participate in the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) programs, which are considered to be at the level of the A Level qualifications and earn points on the UCAS Tariff,[16][18] or may opt to take A Level examinations in British international schools or as private candidates. College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) tests, such as the SAT, SAT Subject Tests, or the ACT, may also be considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) recommends that in addition to a high school diploma, grades of 3 or above in at least two, or ideally three, Advanced Placement exams may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.[16] The IB Diploma may also be accepted. For the College Entrance Examination Board tests, a minimum score of 600 or higher in all sections of the SAT or a minimum score of 26 or higher in all sections of the ACT along with a minimum score of 600 in relevant SAT Subject Tests may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the United States and Canada, there is universal recognition of all officially awarded high school diplomas earned in any jurisdiction. Employers, colleges, and universities generally do not distinguish between high school diplomas based on the jurisdiction of awarding, and consider all high school diplomas of the same level to be equivalent. However, where differences in curriculum requirements or levels of academic rigor are made between diplomas issued in a particular jurisdiction, distinctions may be made. Specific requirements for the curriculum content and the level of academic rigor needed for acceptance may be made by those who request a high school diploma.","input":"What is the uk equivalent of a high school diploma?"},{"output":"August 14, 1952","context":"The term \\"Third World\\" arose during the Cold War to define countries that remained non-aligned with either NATO or the Communist Bloc. The United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Western European nations and their allies represented the First World, while the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, and their allies represented the Second World. This terminology provided a way of broadly categorizing the nations of the Earth into three groups based on political and economic divisions. Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the term Third World has been used less and less. It is being replaced with terms such as developing countries, least developed countries or the Global South. The concept itself has become outdated as it no longer represents the current political or economic state of the world.\\r\\nThe Third World was normally seen to include many countries with colonial pasts in Africa, Latin America, Oceania and Asia. It was also sometimes taken as synonymous with countries in the Non-Aligned Movement. In the dependency theory of thinkers like Ra~l Prebisch, Walter Rodney, Theotonio dos Santos, and Andre Gunder Frank, the Third World has also been connected to the world-systemic economic division as \\"periphery\\" countries dominated by the countries comprising the economic \\"core\\".[1]\\r\\nDue to the complex history of evolving meanings and contexts, there is no clear or agreed-upon definition of the Third World.[1] Some countries in the Communist Bloc, such as Cuba, were often regarded as \\"Third World\\". Because many Third World countries were economically poor, and non-industrialized, it became a stereotype to refer to poor countries as \\"third world countries\\", yet the \\"Third World\\" term is also often taken to include newly industrialized countries like Brazil, India and China now more commonly referred to as part of BRIC. Historically, some European countries were non-aligned and a few of these were and are very prosperous, including Ireland, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and Yugoslavia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench demographer, anthropologist and historian Alfred Sauvy, in an article published in the French magazine L'Observateur, August 14, 1952, coined the term Third World (French: Tiers Monde), referring to countries that were unaligned with either the Communist Soviet bloc or the Capitalist NATO bloc during the Cold War.[2] His usage was a reference to the Third Estate, the commoners of France who, before and during the French Revolution, opposed the clergy and nobles, who composed the First Estate and Second Estate, respectively. Sauvy wrote, \\"This third world ignored, exploited, despised like the third estate also wants to be something.\\"[3] He conveyed the concept of political non-alignment with either the capitalist or communist bloc.[4]\\r\\nThe \\"Three Worlds Theory\\" developed by Mao Zedong is different from the Western theory of the Three Worlds or Third World. For example, in the Western theory, China and India belong respectively to the second and third worlds, but in Mao's theory both China and India are part of the Third World which he defined as consisting of exploited nations.\\r\\nThird Worldism is a political movement that argues for the unity of third-world nations against first-world influence and the principle of non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs. Groups most notable for expressing and exercising this idea are the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Group of 77 which provide a base for relations and diplomacy between not just the third-world countries, but between the third-world and the first and second worlds. The notion has been criticized as providing a fig leaf for human-rights violations and political repression by dictatorships.[5]\\r\\nMost Third World countries are former colonies. Having gained independence, many of these countries, especially smaller ones, were faced with the challenges of nation- and institution-building on their own for the first time. Due to this common background, many of these nations were \\"developing\\" in economic terms for most of the 20th century, and many still are. This term, used today, generally denotes countries that have not developed to the same levels as OECD countries, and are thus in the process of developing.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, economist Peter Bauer offered a competing definition for the term \\"Third World\\". He claimed that the attachment of Third World status to a particular country was not based on any stable economic or political criteria, and was a mostly arbitrary process. The large diversity of countries considered part of the Third World  from Indonesia to Afghanistan  ranged widely from economically primitive to economically advanced and from politically non-aligned to Soviet- or Western-leaning. An argument could also be made for how parts of the U.S. are more like the Third World.[6]\\r\\nThe only characteristic that Bauer found common in all Third World countries was that their governments \\"demand and receive Western aid,\\" the giving of which he strongly opposed. Thus, the aggregate term \\"Third World\\" was challenged as misleading even during the Cold War period, because it had no consistent or collective identity among the countries it supposedly encompassed.\\r\\nDuring the Cold War, unaligned countries of the Third World[1] were seen as potential allies by both the First and Second World. Therefore, the United States and the Soviet Union went to great lengths to establish connections in these countries by offering economic and military support to gain strategically located alliances (e.g., United States in Vietnam or Soviet Union in Cuba).[1] By the end of the Cold War, many Third World countries had adopted capitalist or communist economic models and continued to receive support from the side they had chosen. Throughout the Cold War and beyond, the countries of the Third World have been the priority recipients of Western foreign aid and the focus of economic development through mainstream theories such as modernization theory and dependency theory.[1]\\r\\nBy the end of the 1960s, the idea of the Third World came to represent countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America that were considered underdeveloped by the West based on a variety of characteristics (low economic development, low life expectancy, high rates of poverty and disease, etc.).[2] These countries became the targets for aid and support from governments, NGOs and individuals from wealthier nations. One popular model, known as Rostow's stages of growth, argued that development took place in 5 stages (Traditional Society; Pre-conditions for Take-off; Take-off; Drive to Maturity; Age of High Mass Consumption).[7] W. W. Rostow argued that Take-off was the critical stage that the Third World was missing or struggling with. Thus, foreign aid was needed to help kick-start industrialization and economic growth in these countries.[7]\\r\\nMany times there is a clear distinction between First and Third Worlds. When talking about the Global North and the Global South, the majority of the time the two go hand in hand. People refer to the two as \\"Third World/South\\" and \\"First World/North\\" because the Global North is more affluent and developed, whereas the Global South is less developed and often poorer.[8]\\r\\nTo counter this mode of thought, some scholars began proposing the idea of a change in world dynamics that began in the late 1980s, and termed it the Great Convergence.[9] As Jack A. Goldstone and his colleagues put it, \\"in the twentieth century, the Great Divergence peaked before the First World War and continued until the early 1970s, then, after two decades of indeterminate fluctuations, in the late 1980s it was replaced by the Great Convergence as the majority of Third World countries reached economic growth rates significantly higher than those in most First World countries\\".[10]\\r\\nOthers have observed a return to Cold War-era alignments (MacKinnon, 2007; Lucas, 2008), this time with substantial changes between 1990ÿ2015 in geography, the world economy and relationship dynamics between current and emerging world powers; not necessarily redefining the classic meaning of First, Second, and Third World terms, but rather which countries belong to them by way of association to which world power or coalition of countries  such as G7, the European Union, OECD; G20, OPEC, BRICS, ASEAN; the African Union, and the Eurasian Union.","input":"When was the term third world first used?"},{"output":"Pinellas County, Florida, United States","context":"Indian Rocks Beach is a city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States.

A species of considerable medical importance, P. aeruginosa is a multidrug resistant pathogen recognised for its ubiquity, its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and its association with serious illnesses ÿ hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and various sepsis syndromes.\\r\\nThe organism is considered opportunistic insofar as serious infection often occurs during existing diseases or conditions ÿ most notably cystic fibrosis and traumatic burns. It is also found generally in the immunocompromised but can infect the immunocompetent as in hot tub folliculitis. Treatment of P. aeruginosa infections can be difficult due to its natural resistance to antibiotics. When more advanced antibiotic drug regimens are needed adverse effects may result.\\r\\nIt is citrate, catalase, and oxidase positive. It is found in soil, water, skin flora, and most man-made environments throughout the world. It thrives not only in normal atmospheres, but also in low-oxygen atmospheres, thus has colonized many natural and artificial environments. It uses a wide range of organic material for food; in animals, its versatility enables the organism to infect damaged tissues or those with reduced immunity. The symptoms of such infections are generalized inflammation and sepsis. If such colonizations occur in critical body organs, such as the lungs, the urinary tract, and kidneys, the results can be fatal.[1] Because it thrives on moist surfaces, this bacterium is also found on and in medical equipment, including catheters, causing cross-infections in hospitals and clinics. It is also able to decompose hydrocarbons and has been used to break down tarballs and oil from oil spills.[2] P. aeruginosa is not extremely virulent in comparison with other major pathogenic bacterial species ÿ for example Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes ÿ though P. aeruginosa is capable of extensive colonization, and can aggregate into enduring biofilms.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Pseudomonas means \\"false unit\\", from the Greek pseudo (Greek: Ѵ, false) and (Latin: monas, from Greek: ?, a single unit). The stem word mon was used early in the history of microbiology to refer to germs, e.g., kingdom Monera.\\r\\nThe species name aeruginosa is a Latin word meaning verdigris (\\"copper rust\\"), referring to the blue-green color of laboratory cultures of the species. This blue-green pigment is a combination of two metabolites of P. aeruginosa, pyocyanin (blue) and pyoverdine (green), which impart the blue-green characteristic color of cultures. Another assertion is that the word may be derived from the Greek prefix ae- meaning \\"old or aged\\", and the suffix ruginosa means wrinkled or bumpy.[4]\\r\\nThe names pyocyanin and pyoverdine are from the Greek, with pyo-, meaning \\"pus\\",[5] cyanin, meaning \\"blue\\", and verdine, meaning \\"green\\". Pyoverdine in the absence of pyocyanin is a fluorescent-yellow color.\\r\\nThe genome of P. aeruginosa is relatively large (5.5ÿ6.8 Mb) and encodes between 5,500 and 6,000 open reading frames, depending on the strain;[6] 5,021 genes are present across the first five genomes analyzed, with at least 70% sequence identity. This set of genes is the P. aeruginosa core genome.[7]\\r\\nP. aeruginosa is a facultative anaerobe, as it is well adapted to proliferate in conditions of partial or total oxygen depletion. This organism can achieve anaerobic growth with nitrate or nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor. When oxygen, nitrate, and nitrite are absent, it is able to ferment arginine and pyruvate by substrate-level phosphorylation.[8] Adaptation to microaerobic or anaerobic environments is essential for certain lifestyles of P. aeruginosa, for example, during lung infection in cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, where thick layers of lung mucus and alginate surrounding mucoid bacterial cells can limit the diffusion of oxygen. P. aeruginosa growth within the human body can be asymptomatic until the bacteria form a biofilm, which overwhelms the immune system. These biofilms are found in the lungs of cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, and can prove fatal.[9][10][11][12][13][14]\\r\\nP. aeruginosa relies on iron as a nutrient source in order to grow. However, iron is not easily accessible because it is not commonly found in the environment. Iron is usually found in a largely insoluble ferric form.[15] Furthermore, excessively high levels of iron can be toxic to P. aeruginosa. To overcome this and regulate proper intake of iron, P. aeruginosa uses siderophores. Siderophores are secreted molecules that bind and transport iron.[16] These iron-siderophore complexes, however, are non-specific. The bacterium that produced the siderophores does not necessarily receive the direct benefit of iron intake. Rather all members of the cellular population are equally likely to access the iron-siderophore complexes. This dynamic is an example of an altruistic interaction; members suffer the metabolic cost of siderophores production for the good of the group. Members of the cellular population that can efficiently produce these siderophores are commonly referred to as cooperators; members that produce little to no siderophores are often referred to as cheaters. Research has shown when cooperators and cheaters are grown together, cooperators have a decrease in fitness while cheaters have an increase in fitness.[17] It is observed that the magnitude of change in fitness increases with increasing iron-limitation.[18] With an increase in fitness, the cheaters can outcompete the cooperators; this leads to an overall decrease in fitness of the group, due to lack of sufficient siderophore production. These observations suggest that having a mix of cooperators and cheaters can reduce the virulent nature of P. aeruginosa.[17]\\r\\nAn opportunistic, nosocomial pathogen of immunocompromised individuals, P. aeruginosa typically infects the airway, urinary tract, burns, and wounds, and also causes other blood infections.[19]\\r\\nIt is the most common cause of infections of burn injuries and of the outer ear (otitis externa), and is the most frequent colonizer of medical devices (e.g., catheters). Pseudomonas can be spread by equipment that gets contaminated and is not properly cleaned or on the hands of healthcare workers.[20] Pseudomonas can, in rare circumstances, cause community-acquired pneumonias,[21] as well as ventilator-associated pneumonias, being one of the most common agents isolated in several studies.[22] Pyocyanin is a virulence factor of the bacteria and has been known to cause death in C. elegans by oxidative stress. However, salicylic acid can inhibit pyocyanin production.[23] One in ten hospital-acquired infections is from Pseudomonas. Cystic fibrosis patients are also predisposed to P. aeruginosa infection of the lungs. P. aeruginosa may also be a common cause of \\"hot-tub rash\\" (dermatitis), caused by lack of proper, periodic attention to water quality. Since these bacteria like moist environments, such as hot tubs and swimming pools, they can cause skin rash or swimmer's ear.[20] Pseudomonas is also a common cause of postoperative infection in radial keratotomy surgery patients. The organism is also associated with the skin lesion ecthyma gangrenosum. P. aeruginosa is frequently associated with osteomyelitis involving puncture wounds of the foot, believed to result from direct inoculation with P. aeruginosa via the foam padding found in tennis shoes, with diabetic patients at a higher risk.\\r\\nP. aeruginosa uses the virulence factor exotoxin A to inactivate eukaryotic elongation factor 2 via ADP-ribosylation in the host cell, much as the diphtheria toxin does. Without elongation factor 2, eukaryotic cells cannot synthesize proteins and necrotise. The release of intracellular contents induces an immunologic response in immunocompetent patients. In addition P. aeruginosa uses an exoenzyme, ExoU, which degrades the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, leading to lysis. Increasingly, it is becoming recognized that the iron-acquiring siderophore, pyoverdine, also functions as a toxin by removing iron from mitochondria, inflicting damage on this organelle.[24][25]\\r\\nPhenazines are redox-active pigments produced by P. aeruginosa. These pigments are involved in quorum sensing, virulence, and iron acquisition.[26] P. aeruginosa produces several pigments all produced via a biosynthetic pathway. Pyocyanin, 1-Hydroxyphenazine, Phenazine-1-Carboxamide, 5-methylphenazine-1-carboxylic acid betaine, and Aeruginosin A. Two operons are involved in phenazine biosynthesis: phzA1B1C1D1E1F1G1 and phzA2B2C2D2E2F2G2.[27][28] These operons convert a chorismic acid to the phenazines mentioned above. Three key genes, phzH, phzM, and phzS convert phenazine-1-carboxylic acid to the phenazines mentioned above. Though phenazine biosynthesis is well studied, questions remain as to the final structure of the brown phenazine pyomelanin.\\r\\nWhen pyocyanin biosynthesis is inhibited, a decrease in P. aeruginosa pathogenicity is observed in vitro.[28] This suggests that pyocyanin is most responsible for the initial colonization of P. aeruginosa in vivo.\\r\\nWith low phosphate levels, P. aeruginosa has been found to activate from benign symbiont to express lethal toxins inside the intestinal tract and severely damage or kill the host, which can be mitigated by providing excess phosphate instead of antibiotics.[29]\\r\\nIn higher plants, P. aeruginosa induces soft rot, for example in Arabidopsis thaliana (Thale cress)[30] and Lactuca sativa (lettuce).[31][32] It is also pathogenic to invertebrate animals, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,[33][34] the fruit fly Drosophila[35] and the moth Galleria mellonella.[36] The associations of virulence factors are the same for plant and animal infections.[31][37]\\r\\nRegulation of gene expression can occur through cell-cell communication or quorum sensing (QS) via the production of small molecules called autoinducers. The extracellular accumulation of these molecules signals to bacteria to alter gene expression and coordinate behavior. P. aeruginosa employs three interconnected QS systems ÿ lasRl, rhlRl, and PQS ÿ that each produce unique signaling molecules.[38] Detection of these molecules indicates P. aeruginosa is growing as biofilm within the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.[39] QS is known to control expression of a number of virulence factors, including the pigment pyocyanin. Another form of gene regulation that allows the bacteria to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling. Recent studies have discovered anaerobiosis can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of QS. This important link between QS and anaerobiosis has a significant impact on production of virulence factors of this organism.[40] Garlic experimentally blocks quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa.[41]\\r\\nBiofilms of P. aeruginosa can cause chronic opportunistic infections, which are a serious problem for medical care in industrialized societies, especially for immunocompromised patients and the elderly. They often cannot be treated effectively with traditional antibiotic therapy. Biofilms seem to protect these bacteria from adverse environmental factors. P. aeruginosa can cause nosocomial infections and is considered a model organism for the study of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Researchers consider it important to learn more about the molecular mechanisms that cause the switch from planktonic growth to a biofilm phenotype and about the role of QS in treatment-resistant bacteria such as P. aeruginosa. This should contribute to better clinical management of chronically infected patients, and should lead to the development of new drugs.[40]\\r\\nMany genes and factors affect biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. One of the main gene operons responsible for the initiation and maintaining the biofilm is the PSL operon.[42] This 15-gene operon is responsible for the cell-cell and cell-surface interactions required for cell communication. It is also responsible for the sequestering of the extracellular polymeric substance matrix. This matrix is composed of nucleic acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and various ions. This matrix is one of the main resistance mechanisms in the biofilms of P. aeruginosa.\\r\\nCyclic di-GMP is a major contributor to biofilm adherent properties. This signalling molecule in high quantities makes superadherent biofilms. When suppressed, the biofilms are less adherent and easier to treat. Polysaccharide synthesis locus (PSL) and cdi-GMP form a negative feedback loop. PSL stimulates cdi-GMP production, while high cd-GMP turns on the operon and increases activity of the operon.\\r\\nRecent studies have shown that the dispersed cells from P. aeruginosa biofilms have lower c-di-GMP levels and different physiologies from those of planktonic and biofilm cells.[43][44] Such dispersed cells are found to be highly virulent against macrophages and C. elegans, but highly sensitive towards iron stress, as compared with planktonic cells.[43]\\r\\nRecently, scientists have been examining the possible genetic basis for P. aeruginosa resistance to antibiotics such as tobramycin. One locus identified as being an important genetic determinant of the resistance in this species is ndvB, which encodes periplasmic glucans that may interact with antibiotics and cause them to become sequestered into the periplasm. These results suggest a genetic basis exists behind bacterial antibiotic resistance, rather than the biofilm simply acting as a diffusion barrier to the antibiotic.[45]\\r\\nDepending on the nature of infection, an appropriate specimen is collected and sent to a bacteriology laboratory for identification. As with most bacteriological specimens, a Gram stain is performed, which may show Gram-negative rods and/or white blood cells. P. aeruginosa produces colonies with a characteristic \\"grape-like\\" or \\"fresh-tortilla\\" odor on bacteriological media. In mixed cultures, it can be isolated as clear colonies on MacConkey agar (as it does not ferment lactose) which will test positive for oxidase. Confirmatory tests include production of the blue-green pigment pyocyanin on cetrimide agar and growth at 42?C. A TSI slant is often used to distinguish nonfermenting Pseudomonas species from enteric pathogens in faecal specimens.\\r\\nWhen P. aeruginosa is isolated from a normally sterile site (blood, bone, deep collections), it is generally considered dangerous, and almost always requires treatment.[citation needed] However, P. aeruginosa is frequently isolated from nonsterile sites (mouth swabs, sputum, etc.), and, under these circumstances, it may represent colonization and not infection. The isolation of P. aeruginosa from nonsterile specimens should, therefore, be interpreted cautiously, and the advice of a microbiologist or infectious diseases physician/pharmacist should be sought prior to starting treatment. Often, no treatment is needed.\\r\\n[46]P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative, aerobic (and at times facultatively anaerobic), bacillus with unipolar motility.[47] It has been identified as an opportunistic pathogen of both humans and plants.[48] P. aeruginosa is the type species of the genus Pseudomonas.[49]\\r\\nIn certain conditions, P. aeruginosa can secrete a variety of pigments, including pyocyanin (blue-green), pyoverdine (yellow-green and fluorescent), and pyorubin (red-brown). These can be used to identify the organism.[50]\\r\\nP. aeruginosa is often preliminarily identified by its pearlescent appearance and grape-like or tortilla-like odor in vitro. Definitive clinical identification of P. aeruginosa often includes identifying the production of both pyocyanin and fluorescein, as well as its ability to grow at 42?C. P. aeruginosa is capable of growth in diesel and jet fuels, where it is known as a hydrocarbon-using microorganism, causing microbial corrosion.[51] It creates dark, gellish mats sometimes improperly called \\"algae\\" because of their appearance.[citation needed]\\r\\nMany P. aeruginosa isolates are resistant to a large range of antibiotics and may demonstrate additional resistance after unsuccessful treatment. It should usually be possible to guide treatment according to laboratory sensitivities, rather than choosing an antibiotic empirically. If antibiotics are started empirically, then every effort should be made to obtain cultures (before administering first dose of antibiotic), and the choice of antibiotic used should be reviewed when the culture results are available.\\r\\nDue to widespread resistance to many common first-line antibiotics, carbapenems, polymyxins, and more recently tigecycline were considered to be the drugs of choice; however, resistance to these drugs has also been reported. Despite this, they are still being used in areas where resistance has not yet been reported. Use of -lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam has been advised in combination with antibiotics to enhance antimicrobial action even in the presence of a certain level of resistance. Combination therapy after rigorous antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been found to be the best course of action in the treatment of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. Some next-generation antibiotics that are reported as being active against P. aeruginosa include doripenem, ceftobiprole, and ceftaroline. However, these require more clinical trials for standardization. Therefore, research for the discovery of new antibiotics and drugs against P. aeruginosa is very much needed. Antibiotics that may have activity against P. aeruginosa include:\\r\\nAs fluoroquinolone is one of the few antibiotics widely effective against P. aeruginosa, in some hospitals, its use is severely restricted to avoid the development of resistant strains. On the rare occasions where infection is superficial and limited (for example, ear infections or nail infections), topical gentamicin or colistin may be used.\\r\\nOne of the most worrisome characteristics of P. aeruginosa is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., mexAB, mexXY, etc.) and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.[53] In addition to this intrinsic resistance, P. aeruginosa easily develops acquired resistance either by mutation in chromosomally encoded genes or by the horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants. Development of multidrug resistance by P. aeruginosa isolates requires several different genetic events, including acquisition of different mutations and/or horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Hypermutation favours the selection of mutation-driven antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa strains producing chronic infections, whereas the clustering of several different antibiotic resistance genes in integrons favors the concerted acquisition of antibiotic resistance determinants. Some recent studies have shown phenotypic resistance associated to biofilm formation or to the emergence of small-colony variants may be important in the response of P. aeruginosa populations to antibiotics treatment.[40]\\r\\nMechanisms underlying antibiotic resistance have been found to include production of antibiotic-degrading or antibiotic-inactivating enzymes, outer membrane proteins to evict the antibiotics and mutations to change antibiotic targets. Presence of antibiotic-degrading enzymes such as extended-spectrum -lactamases like PER-1, PER-2, VEB-1, AmpC cephalosporinases, carbapenemases like serine oxacillinases, metallo-b-lactamases, OXA-type carbapenemases, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, among others have been reported. P. aeruginosa can also modify the targets of antibiotic action, for example methylation of 16S rRNA to prevent aminoglycoside binding and modification of DNA, or topoisomerase to protect it from the action of quinolones. P. aeruginosa has also been reported to possess multidrug efflux pumps like AdeABC and AdeDE efflux systems that confer resistance against number of antibiotic classes. An important factor found to be associated with antibiotic resistance is the decrease in the virulence capabilities of the resistant strain. Such findings have been reported in the case of rifampicin-resistant and colistin-resistant strains, in which decrease in infective ability, quorum sensing and motility have been documented.\\r\\nMutations in DNA gyrase are commonly associated with antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa. These mutations, when combined with others, confer high resistance without hindering survival. Additionally, genes involved in cyclic-di-GMP signaling may contribute to resistance. When grown in vitro conditions designed to mimic a cystic fibrosis patient's lungs, these genes mutate repeatedly.[54]\\r\\nProbiotic prophylaxis may prevent colonization and delay onset of Pseudomonas infection in an ICU setting.[55] Immunoprophylaxis against Pseudomonas is being investigated.[56] The risk of contracting 'P. aeruginosa can be reduced by avoiding pools, hot tubs, and other bodies of standing water; regularly disinfecting and/or replacing equipment that regularly encounters moisture (such as contact lens equipment and solutions); and washing one's hands often (which is protective against many other pathogens as well). However, even the best hygiene practices cannot totally protect an individual against P. aeruginosa, given how common 'P. aeruginosa is in the environment.[57]\\r\\nPhage therapy against P. aeruginosa has been investigated as a possible effective treatment, which can be combined with antibiotics, has no contraindications and minimal adverse effects. Phages are produced as sterile liquid, suitable for intake, applications etc.[58] Phage therapy against ear infections caused by P. aeruginosa was reported in the journal Clinical Otolaryngology in August 2009.[59]\\r\\nIn 2013, Jo?o Xavier described an experiment in which P. aeruginosa, when subjected to repeated rounds of conditions in which it needed to swarm to acquire food, developed the ability to \\"hyperswarm\\" at speeds 25% faster than baseline organisms, by developing multiple flagella, whereas the baseline organism has a single flagellum.[60] This result was notable in the field of experimental evolution in that it was highly repeatable.[61]\\r\\nP. aeruginosa has been studied for use in bioremediation and use in processing polyethylene in municipal solid waste.[62]","input":"What is the drug of choice for pseudomonas?"},{"output":"Joseph Williams","context":"Simba is a fictional character who appears in Disney's The Lion King franchise. Introduced in Walt Disney Animation's 32nd animated feature film The Lion King (1994), the character subsequently appears in its sequels The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) and The Lion King 1? (2004) as well as the upcoming 2019 remake of the original film directed by Jon Favreau.\\r\\nSimba was created by screenwriters Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton. While Mark Henn served as Simba's supervising animator as a cub, Ruben A. Aquino animated the character as he appears as an adult.\\r\\nAlthough considered an original character, Simba was inspired by the character Bambi from Disney's Bambi (1942), as well as the stories of Moses and Joseph from the Bible. Additionally, several similarities have been drawn between Simba and Prince Hamlet from William Shakespeare's tragedy of the same name. In 1997, The Lion King was adapted into a Broadway musical, with actors Scott Irby-Ranniar and Jason Raize originating the roles of the cub and adult Simbas, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for The Lion King originated from Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg in 1989[2] and was originally conceived under the title King of the Jungle.[3] The story, which has been compared to Bambi (1942),[4] was jokingly referred to as \\"Bambi in Africa\\" because of the similarities between the two films and their respective main characters.[5] Co-director Rob Minkoff said that both films are \\"more true-life adventure than mythical epic.\\"[5] Though considered an original[6][7] coming-of-age[8] story that follows the life of Simba as he grows up and \\"tak[es] on the responsibility of adulthood,\\" co-directors Roger Allers and Minkoff drew inspiration from other sources. In particular, the biblical figures Moses and Joseph served as creative inspiration for the character.[9] Producer Don Hahn said that, like them, Simba is \\"born into royalty, is then exiled, and has to return to claim [his] kingdom.\\"[10]\\r\\nSeveral film and entertainment critics have noted similarities and parallels between the stories of The Lion King and William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, and their protagonists.[11][12][13][14] Allers said that these similarities were not initially intentional and came as a surprise to the filmmakers themselves; they noticed the similarities only after the story was established and they eventually decided to pursue it. According to Hahn, \\"When we first pitched the revised outline of the movie ... someone in the room announced that its themes and relationships were similar to Hamlet. Everyone responded favorably to the idea that we were doing something Shakespearean, so we continued to look for ways to model our film on that all-time classic.\\"[10]\\r\\nScreenwriter Jonathan Roberts said that, in a musical, songs are used to convey a character's emotions and \\"I wants.\\" Composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice wrote the song \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" in order to give Simba a medium through which he can express his desire to become King of the Pride Lands. Roberts said, \\"It's a way for storytellers to move the story and deliver the direction of the character.\\"[15]\\r\\nMatthew Broderick provided the speaking voice of Adult Simba.[16] The first actor to be assigned to The Lion King,[7] Broderick learned of the role while he was on vacation in Ireland, where he received a telephone call from his agent informing him that the directors were interested in casting him as Simba.[17] At the time, Broderick was well known for portraying the title character in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). The directors decided to cast him as Simba because they felt that he was \\"perfect\\" for the role; according to producer Don Hahn, Broderick's voice resembled \\"the kind of character who could be irresponsible and likeable, but you also felt that he could come back in a very heroic way.\\"[18] Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who was starring as Randy Taylor on the television sitcom Home Improvement at the time,[19][20] was cast as the speaking voice of Young Simba.[21] His appearance and personality would later serve as creative inspiration for supervising animator Mark Henn.[6]\\r\\nThough Broderick is a trained Broadway singer, he was not up to the task, and neither was non-singer Thomas, so Toto lead singer Joseph Williams and actor Jason Weaver were hired to dub their respective singing voices. Williams' voice is heard on the song \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\".[22] Impressed by Weaver's performance as a young Michael Jackson in the miniseries The Jacksons: An American Dream, songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice recruited him to record \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" and \\"Hakuna Matata\\"[23] while the film was still in its early stages of production.[24] As directors, Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff worked closely with the actors in order to ensure credible performances.[25] As is frequently done in animated films, the filmmakers videotaped the actors while they recorded their dialogue, allowing the animators to incorporate their specific mannerisms into the designs of their characters.[26]\\r\\nWhen The Lion King was green-lit, its concept and story were not well received by studio employees. To guarantee the release of at least one successful film, Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg divided the studio into two separate projects: The Lion King and Pocahontas (1995), with Pocahontas expected to be the more successful of the two. Because of this assumption, the majority of the studio's more seasoned animators gravitated towards Pocahontas because The Lion King was deemed a \\"risk\\", while less experienced animators were assigned to work on The Lion King.[27] Co-director Rob Minkoff received this positively, saying that this decision \\"gave a lot of newer animators a chance to step up to leadership roles.\\"[28]\\r\\nThe role of animating Simba was divided between Mark Henn and Ruben A. Aquino. While Henn served as the supervising animator of Simba as a cub, credited as Young Simba,[30] Aquino was placed in charge of animating the character as he appears as an adult.[31] The Lion King was Disney's first animated feature film to feature absolutely no humans since Robin Hood (1973). According to Aquino, animating four-legged creatures is difficult because the artists are faced with the task of drawing \\"twice as many legs ... as you do with human characters\\" and must also attribute to them both human and animal-like qualities. For assistance, Aquino drew influence from previous animated films that feature four-legged creatures as their main characters, citing Bambi, Lady and the Tramp (1955) and The Jungle Book (1967) as his main sources of inspiration.[32]\\r\\nBefore The Lion King, Henn's experience as a supervising animator was limited to predominantly female characters;[4][33] he had just recently completed work on Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Jasmine from Aladdin (1992).[29] When he became involved with The Lion King, Henn initially expressed interest in animating the film's villain, Scar, because he wanted to do \\"something different.\\"[4] However, producer Don Hahn felt that he was better suited for animating Simba.[34] Henn approaches animating new characters by \\"put[ting himself] into the characters situation.\\" Simba proved to be a challenge because Henn was faced with the task of creating an animated character who would both appear and behave like a real lion cub. To achieve this, Henn visited zoos, sketched and studied live lion cubs that were brought into the studio for research, and frequently consulted with wildlife experts.[35]\\r\\nWhen it came time to animate Simba during the \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" musical sequence, Henn felt it essential that the character remain on all fours at all times, despite the fact that he is meant to be dancing.[33] In terms of personality, Henn aimed to depict Simba as a \\"cocky, confident character\\" at the beginning of the film, who must eventually mature and learn to take responsibility.[4] The animators would often observe and document the voice actors while they recorded their dialogue, using their movements and mannerisms as a visual aid. Actor Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who provided the voice of Young Simba, served as inspiration for the design and personality of Simba. Henn said, \\"I loved watching Jonathan Taylor Thomas when he was a boy on Home Improvement, and getting to meet him and observe him.\\"[36] Although Aquino was responsible for animating the majority of Simba's adult sequences, Henn animated the character's first appearance as an adult that occurs near the end of the \\"Hakuna Matata\\" musical number.[37]\\r\\nReleased in theaters in 1994, The Lion King marks Simba's first appearance. All the animals in the Pride Lands gather at the foot of Pride Rock to commemorate the birth of Simba, who will eventually succeed to the throne and take his father Mufasa's place as king. Furious by the fact that he is no longer next in line, Simba's jealous uncle Scar refuses to attend the ceremony. While Simba grows into a rambunctious lion cub who frequently boasts about the fact that he will someday rule over the Pride Lands, Scar secretly plots against him.\\r\\nScar plots regicide and familicide against Simba and Mufasa by luring Simba into a vast gorge, where he triggers a wildebeest stampede. Notified by Scar that Simba is in danger, Mufasa rushes to his aid and manages to place him safely on a ledge. Weakened and unable to pull himself up the steep slope to safety, Mufasa asks his brother for assistance. However, Scar's true nature is revealed and he betrays Mufasa, throwing him into the gorge where he is killed by the fall.\\r\\nConvinced by Scar that he is responsible for his father's death, Simba runs away to a distant jungle where he is befriended by Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him to ignore his past and avoid his responsibilities. There, he grows into a handsome young lion, while Scar wreaks havoc on the Pride Lands. When Simba is discovered by his childhood friend named Nala, she confronts him, warning him of Scar's tyranny and begging him to return home. Afraid of facing his past, Simba refuses until a wise mandrill named Rafiki leads him to Mufasa's ghost, who convinces him to return home and reclaim his kingdom from Scar.[38]\\r\\nSimba returns to the Pride Lands and finds them barren because their natural resources have been squandered and abused by Scar. After witnessing Scar strike his mother Sarabi, Simba orders Scar to resign. At first thrown by the fact that he is alive, Scar soon regains composure and forces Simba to reveal that he is responsible for Mufasa's death, while cornering him at the edge of Pride Rock, hoping to subject him to a similar fate as his father. Having grown overconfident, Scar finally reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Furious, Simba tackles Scar and forces him into announcing this to the pride, initiating a battle between Simba's pride of lionesses, Timon, Pumbaa and Scar's army of hyenas. Simba eventually defeats Scar and throws him into a pit, where he is cornered and killed by the hyenas, who overheard Scar blame them for what he'd done. Simba then takes his rightful place as king. When the kingdom returns to its former glory, the animals welcome the birth of King Simba and Queen Nala's first born.[39]\\r\\nA direct-to-video sequel released in 1998, Simba's Pride takes place shortly after the events of the first film, depicting Simba and Nala as king and queen of the Pride Lands. In a ceremony at Pride Rock, the Pride Lands commemorate the birth of Simba and Nala's daughter Kiara, whom Simba is overprotective of. He discovers that Kiara has disobeyed him by visiting the forbidden Outlands, home to an enemy pride of Scar's followers known as the Outsiders, and befriending a young member of the pride named Kovu. After a close confrontation with Kovu's mother Zira, the leader of the Outsiders and Scar's most loyal follower, Simba separates the two and reminds Kiara of her responsibilities as the future queen. Meanwhile, Zira plots to manipulate Kovu to exact revenge on Simba for Scar's death.\\r\\nSeveral years later, Simba grants an adolescent Kiara's request to embark on her first hunt, but has Timon and Pumbaa follow her in secret. Realizing this, Kiara rebels and pursue her hunt outside of the Pride Lands, where she nearly falls victim to a wildfire. Kiara is rescued by Kovu, who returns her to the Pride Lands, which is actually part of Zira's plan to overthrow Simba. Saying that he has left the Outsiders, Kovu asks Simba to let him join his pride. Simba reluctantly accepts, but distrusts Kovu because of his similarities to Scar, and continues to treat him ruthlessly. That night, Simba has a nightmare about attempting to save his father Mufasa from falling into the stampede but is stopped by Scar who turns into Kovu and throws Simba off the cliff into the stampede.\\r\\nWhile Kiara and Kovu's friendship continues to grow, Simba, encouraged by Nala, attempts to show Kovu kindness by spending a day with him. Realizing that Kovu is beginning to side with Simba because of his love for Kiara, Zira ambushes and attacks Simba. Convinced by Zira that Kovu is responsible for the ambush, Simba exiles him and forbids Kiara to see him, but she makes her father realize that he is acting irrationally, before leaving to find Kovu. When a battle ensues between the Pride Landers and the Outsiders, Kiara and Kovu arrive and stop them, with Kiara telling them that they are one. When a furious Zira attacks Simba, she is intercepted by Kiara, causing the two to fall over the edge of a cliff. Having landed safely on a ledge, Kiara offers to help Zira, who is struggling to hang on. However, Zira, consumed by her resentment towards Simba, falls to her death. Simba finally approves of Kiara's love for Kovu and reconciles with his daughter, and accepts the two lions as future king and queen of the Pride Lands.[40]\\r\\nIn The Lion King 1?, a direct-to-video followup released in 2004, Simba appears as a less prominent character because the film's primary focus is on Timon and Pumbaa's behind-the-scenes role and involvement in The Lion King,[41][42] in which they appear as supporting characters. Although the two films technically share the same story and timeline, the plot of The Lion King 1? focuses more on Timon and Pumbaa. The meerkat and warthog unknowingly coexist alongside Simba, and the story fills in the two characters' backstories and events that led up to their long-lasting friendship, coinciding with and often initiating the events that affect Simba's life during the first film. These events include the commemorative bow that occurs during the opening \\"Circle of Life\\" musical number and the collapsing of the animal tower that takes place during \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King.\\"[43] The film also explores, in further detail, the relationship among the three characters as Timon and Pumbaa struggle to raise Simba as adoptive \\"parents\\" and disapprove of his relationship with Nala, portraying Simba as he grows from an energetic young lion cub, into an incorrigible teenager and, finally, an independent young lion.[44]\\r\\nIn mid-February 2017, Donald Glover was cast as adult Simba.[45] On November 1, 2017, J.D. McCrary was cast as young Simba.[46]\\r\\nThe success of The Lion King and popularity of its characters led to the production of Timon & Pumbaa, an animated television series starring Timon and Pumbaa. Simba makes several appearances, including one episode in which Timon drags him out to try to revive Pumbaa's lost memory.\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Congo On Like This,\\" Timon and Pumbaa (especially Timon) suspect that Simba has reverted to his carnivorous nature. The episode \\"Shake Your Djibouti\\" again features Simba, when Timon and Pumbaa are forced to train him to protect them from a laboratory monster. Another episode, entitled \\"Rome Alone,\\" shows Simba being captured by Romans and forced into gladiatorial battle with another lion named Claudius. Simba makes brief appearances in \\"Once Upon a Timon\\", \\"Zazu's Off-By-One Day\\", and \\"Beethoven's Whiff\\". He also appears in a music video of \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\".\\r\\nSimba was featured as a guest in the animated series House of Mouse, in which he alternates between cub and adult.\\r\\nIn November 2015, a new series called The Lion Guard was released. Set within the time gap in The Lion King II: Simba's Pride,[47] it features Kion who is the son and youngest child of Simba and Nala, who as the second-born cub, is tasked with assembling a team to protect the Pride Lands.[48]\\r\\nThe success of The Lion King led to the production of a Broadway musical based on the film. Directed by Julie Taymor, with a book by Irene Mecchi and Roger Allers, The Lion King premiered at the New Amsterdam Theatre on November 13, 1997, where it ran for nine years until being moved to the Minskoff Theatre on June 13, 2006.[49] The role of Simba was originated by Scott Irby-Ranniar and Jason Raize, with Irby-Ranniar portraying Young Simba and Raize portraying Adult Simba.[50]\\r\\nRaize auditioned for the role of Adult Simba after hearing that Taymor was looking to cast an actor who was of \\"unidentifiable ethnicity.\\"[51] Raize revealed in an interview that there was a lot of competition for the role because the musical required \\"triple-threat work -- singing, dancing and acting -- that you don't get to such an extent in other shows. It was more the sense of who can take the challenge and not be daunted by the task.\\" Raize, who instantly felt that he \\"had a connection with Simba,\\" eventually won the role with the approval of Taymor and choreographer Garth Fagan,[52] with Fagan admiring the fact that Raize was \\"willing to try, to fail, and then to try again.\\"[8] Once cast, Raize found it difficult to maintain Taymor's \\"sense of duality\\" because Simba is \\"both man and beast.\\" He said, \\"The tendency is to sacrifice one for the other, but you can't.\\"[53] Although hundreds of children auditioned for the role of Young Simba,[54] the casting process was far less grueling for Irby-Ranniar who, according to Taymor, simply \\"walked in and he had the part.\\"[55]\\r\\nIn 1994, a six-volume book set titled The Lion King: Six New Adventures were released. Set after the events of the first film, they featured a cub named Kopa, who was the son of Simba and Nala.\\r\\nAs part of the franchise's merchandising, Simba has appeared in various The Lion King-related products.[56] The character's likeness has been used in and adapted into a variety of items, including plush toys and figurines, clothing, bedding, household decor and appliances.[57] The success of the Broadway musical has also led to its own line of merchandising,[58] including the Simba beanbag doll, based on the character's appearance and costume in the Broadway show.[59][60]\\r\\nSince the film's 1994 debut, Simba has appeared as a playable character in a variety of video game releases, both directly and indirectly associated with the franchise. The character's first appearance as a video game character was in The Lion King, which was released by Virgin Interactive on November 1, 1994, for the video game platforms Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Game Gear, Nintendo Entertainment System and PC.[61] The game follows the plot of the original film and features Simba as both a cub and an adult.[62]\\r\\nOn December 28, 2000,[63] Activision released The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure for Game Boy Color and PlayStation.[64] The game encompasses 10 levels and incorporates the plot of both The Lion King and The Lion King II: Simba's Pride as \\"Simba ... matures from a precocious cub to an adult lion.\\"[65] Simba also appears as a playable character in Disney Interactive Studios' Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure, released on September 3, 2003, for Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox,[66] and Disney Friends , released for Nintendo DS on February 26, 2008.[67] Additionally, Simba appears in the Square Enix Kingdom Hearts video game franchise as a friend and ally of the series' main character, Sora.[68][69][70][71][72]\\r\\nLive versions of Simba appear in the Lion King musical and in the parades and shows at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.\\r\\nSimba was also the main character in \\"Legend of the Lion King,\\" a former Fantasyland attraction in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, which retold the story of the film using fully articulated puppets. Other Disney attractions that have featured Simba include the Mickey's PhilharMagic 3D show and the Hong Kong Disneyland version of It's a Small World.\\r\\nHe appears as one of the main characters at Epcot's Land Pavilion 12-minute edutainment film Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable.\\r\\nAlthough The Lion King itself has garnered universal acclaim from film critics,[73] reception towards Simba has been generally mixed. The Christian Science Monitor's David Sterritt hailed Simba as \\"a superbly realized character,\\" specifically praising the scene in which the character \\"faces discipline by his dad after his adventure with the hyenas.\\"[74] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Simba \\"has been given a marvelously expressive face\\" to the point of which \\"He seems more human than the Ken and Barbie types featured in Aladdin and The Little Mermaid.\\"[75] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described \\"the father-son relationship\\" shared by Simba and Mufasa as \\"movingly rendered,\\"[76] while About.com's David Nusair wrote, \\"its the touching father/son stuff that lies at the heart of the movie that cements The Lion King's place as an utterly timeless piece of work.\\"[77] James Berardinelli of ReelViews enjoyed the fact that the film focuses more on the story of Simba himself as opposed to the romantic relationship developing between the character and Nala. However, Berardinelli criticized Matthew Broderick's vocal performance, describing it as \\"nondescript.\\"[78] Rob Humanick of Slant Magazine hailed the fact that \\"it's never laid on [Simba] that his time as king will directly correspond with the eventual passing of his father\\" as one of the film's \\"most important facets.\\" However, he criticized The Lion King's characters, describing them as well-designed but \\"lazy and troublesome.\\"[79] The Austin Chronicle's Robert Faires felt that Simba and the other Lion King characters, though \\"true\\", were simply unoriginal retreads of preceding animated characters who were \\"swiped from other Disney cartoons.\\"[80]\\r\\nHal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the character a negative review. Labeling Timon and Pumbaa the only interesting characters in The Lion King, Hinson questioned Simba's role as the film's hero.[81] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times agreed, \\"A movie's heroes may have their names above the title, but often as not it's the sidekicks who get the real work done.\\" Turan went on to pan Simba, describing him as \\"irritatingly callow.\\"[82] Chris Hick of the Deseret News complained about the fact that Simba and the other \\"characters in The Lion King are not as warm and fuzzy as other Disney animated features,\\" crediting this with making \\"the film a bit tougher to warm [up] to.\\"[83] ComingSoon.net strongly panned Simba as a lead character, writing, \\"typically for Disney animated fare, it's the hero who is the weak link being both blandly designed and blandly performed.\\"[84] Acknowledging the character's Shakespearean origins, The Baltimore Sun's Stephen Hunter gave Simba a negative review, writing, \\"Alas ...Simba stands in for Hamlet, but he's a lot less complicated; in fact, he's less complicated than Morris the Cat or Sylvester.\\" Hunter continued, \\"Simba the Exile is even less interesting than Simba the Prince.\\"[85] Christopher Null of Contactmusic.com was critical of Weaver's performance as the singing voice of Young Simba, writing, \\"If there's anything annoying about the film, it's the singing. Young Simba sounds like a young Michael Jackson ... You almost don't want him to succeed.\\" However, Null reacted more positively towards Broderick's performance.[86]\\r\\nDespite the character's mixed reception, several critics have awarded specific praise to Broderick for his portrayal of Simba, including the San Francisco Chronicle's Peter Stack and The Washington Post's Desson Howe.[87][88] Annette Basile of Filmink described Broderick's performance as \\"excellent,\\"[89] while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it \\"sumptuous.\\" Digital Spy's Mayer Nissim described Broderick's portrayal of Simba as \\"wonderful.\\"[90]\\r\\nDuring the film's opening number, \\"Circle of Life\\", Rafiki introduces a newborn Simba to the crowd of animals gathered at the foot of Pride Rock by holding him high above their heads while parents Mufasa and Sarabi look on.[9] Since the film's 1994 release, this scene has grown to iconic status.[91] In November 2002, singer Michael Jackson sparked controversy by holding his son over the protective railing of a hotel balcony in Berlin. The event was witnessed by a large crowd of spectators who were watching from below.[92] Some sources have claimed that Jackson was harmlessly attempting to emulate the scene from The Lion King.[93]\\r\\nWhen Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge went into labor with hers and Prince William's baby in July 2013, the idea that the couple should reenact the famous scene from The Lion King became quite popular among Twitter users.[94][95] Radio journalist Darren Simpson reportedly tweeted, \\"when your baby arrives please re-enact the scene from the Lion King\\".[96] Shortly after Middleton gave birth to a boy, England native Tommy Peto initiated a petition asking the couple to welcome their baby by having the Archbishop of Canterbury emulate the scene by holding him over the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Ultimately, the idea was deemed \\"outside the responsibility of the government\\" and was declined.[97]\\r\\nThe scene has found itself the subject of both reference and parody in various forms of media, such as in the film George of the Jungle (1997).[98] In what is almost an exact replica of the scene, George, portrayed by actor Brendan Fraser, takes the place of both Rafiki and Mufasa by standing at the tip of Pride Rock and presenting his young son to a crowd of onlooking animals, accompanied by wife Ursula, portrayed by Leslie Mann.[99]\\r\\nDuring the third season finale of Once Upon a Time, the main character Emma Swan asked her parents Snow White and David Nolan if they were going to hold up her yet unnamed baby brother like in The Lion King.[100] Since the release of The Lion King in 1994, the name \\"Simba\\" has increased in use and popularity among dog and cat owners. According to Comcast in 2010, the use of Simba as a dog name reemerged in popularity in 2009 after experiencing a noticeable decline in 2001, ranking the name ninth out of 10 on its list of \\"Top 10 Trendiest Dog Names of the Year.\\"[101] In May 2013, Yahoo! Lifestyle included the name on its list of \\"Trendiest Dog Names.\\"[102] According to YouPet, Simba is the 17th most popular cat name out of 100 candidates.[103] Care2 included Simba in its article \\"All-around Cool Cat Names,\\"[104] while DutchNews.nl reported that Simba ranks among the country's most popular cat names as of July 2013.[105] In its list of \\"Top Popular Pet Names,\\" BabyNames.com placed Simba at number 64 on its list of most popular dog names out of the 100 that were considered.[106]","input":"Who was the singing voice of young simba?"},{"output":"Most elliptical galaxies are composed of older, low-mass stars","context":"An elliptical galaxy is a type of galaxy having an approximately ellipsoidal shape and a smooth, nearly featureless brightness profile. Unlike flat spiral galaxies with organization and structure, they are more three-dimensional, without much structure, and their stars are in somewhat random orbits around the center. They are one of the three main classes of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work The Realm of the Nebulae,[1] along with spiral and lenticular galaxies. Elliptical galaxies range in shape from nearly spherical to highly flat and in size from tens of millions to over one hundred trillion stars. Originally Edwin Hubble hypothesized that elliptical galaxies evolved into spiral galaxies, which was later discovered to be false.[2] Stars found inside of elliptical galaxies are on average much older than stars found in spiral galaxies.[2]\\r\\nMost elliptical galaxies are composed of older, low-mass stars, with a sparse interstellar medium and minimal star formation activity, and they tend to be surrounded by large numbers of globular clusters. Elliptical galaxies are believed to make up approximately 10%ÿ15% of galaxies in the Virgo Supercluster, and they are not the dominant type of galaxy in the universe overall.[3] They are preferentially found close to the centers of galaxy clusters.[4] Elliptical galaxies are (together with lenticular galaxies) also called \\"early-type\\" galaxies (ETG), due to their location in the Hubble sequence, and are found to be less common in the early Universe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElliptical galaxies are characterized by several properties that make them distinct from other classes of galaxy. They are spherical or ovoid masses of stars, starved of star-making gases. The smallest known elliptical galaxy is about one-tenth the size of the Milky Way[citation needed]. The motion of stars in elliptical galaxies is predominantly radial[citation needed], unlike the disks of spiral galaxies, which are dominated by rotation. Furthermore, there is very little interstellar matter (neither gas nor dust), which results in low rates of star formation, few open star clusters, and few young stars; rather elliptical galaxies are dominated by old stellar populations, giving them red colors. Large elliptical galaxies typically have an extensive system of globular clusters.\\r\\nThe dynamical properties of elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disk galaxies are similar, suggesting that they may be formed by the same physical processes, although this remains controversial. The luminosity profiles of both elliptical galaxies and bulges are well fit by Sersic's law.\\r\\nEvery massive elliptical galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center. Observations of 46 elliptical galaxies, 20 classical bulges, and 22 pseudobulges show that each contain a black hole at the center.[5] The mass of the black hole is tightly correlated with the mass of the galaxy, via the Mÿsigma relation which relates the velocity dispersion of the surrounding stars to the mass of the black hole at the center.\\r\\nElliptical galaxies are preferentially found in galaxy clusters and in compact groups of galaxies.\\r\\nThe traditional portrait[citation needed] of elliptical galaxies paints them as galaxies where star formation finished after an initial burst at high-redshift, leaving them to shine with only their aging stars. Elliptical galaxies typically appear yellow-red, which is in contrast to the distinct blue tinge of most spiral galaxies. In spirals, this blue color emanates largely from the young, hot stars in their spiral arms. Very little star formation is thought to occur in elliptical galaxies, because of their lack of gas compared to spiral or irregular galaxies. However, in recent years, evidence has shown that a reasonable proportion (~25%) of these galaxies have residual gas reservoirs[6] and low level star-formation.[7] Researchers with the Herschel Space Observatory have speculated that the central black holes in elliptical galaxies keep the gas from cooling enough for star formation.[8]\\r\\nElliptical galaxies vary greatly in both size and mass with diameters ranging from 3000 lightyears to more than 700,000 lightyears, and masses from 105 to nearly 1013 solar masses.[10] This range is much broader for this galaxy type than for any other. The smallest, the dwarf elliptical galaxies, may be no larger than a typical globular cluster, but contain a considerable amount of dark matter not present in clusters. Most of these small galaxies may not be related to other ellipticals.\\r\\nThe Hubble classification of elliptical galaxies contains an integer that describes how elongated the galaxy image is. The classification is determined by the ratio of the major (a) to the minor (b) axes of the galaxy's isophotes:\\r\\nThus for a spherical galaxy with a equal to b, the number is 0, and the Hubble type is E0. The limit is about E7, which is believed to be due to a bending instability that causes flatter galaxies to puff up. The most common shape is close to E3. Hubble recognized that his shape classification depends both on the intrinsic shape of the galaxy, as well as the angle with which the galaxy is observed. Hence, some galaxies with Hubble type E0 are actually elongated.\\r\\nThere are two physical types of ellipticals; the \\"boxy\\" giant ellipticals, whose shapes result from random motion which is greater in some directions than in others (anisotropic random motion), and the \\"disky\\" normal and low luminosity ellipticals, which have nearly isotropic random velocities but are flattened due to rotation.\\r\\nDwarf elliptical galaxies have properties that are intermediate between those of regular elliptical galaxies and globular clusters. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies appear to be a distinct class: their properties are more similar to those of irregulars and late spiral-type galaxies.\\r\\nAt the large end of the elliptical spectrum, there is further division, beyond Hubble classification. Beyond gE giant ellipticals, lies D-galaxies and cD-galaxies. These are similar to their smaller brethren, but more diffuse, with larger haloes. Some even appear more akin to lenticular galaxies.\\r\\nIt is widely accepted that the evolution of elliptical galaxies is primarily composed of the merging of smaller galaxies. Many galaxies in the universe are gravitationally bound to other galaxies, which means that they will never escape the pull of the other galaxy. If the galaxies are of similar size, the resultant galaxy will appear similar to neither of the two galaxies merging, but will instead be an elliptical galaxy.\\r\\nSuch major galactic mergers are thought to have been common at early times, but may occur less frequently today. Minor galactic mergers involve two galaxies of very different masses, and are not limited to giant ellipticals. For example, our own Milky Way galaxy is merging with a couple of small galaxies right now.[citation needed] The Milky Way galaxy is also, depending upon an unknown tangential component, on a collision course in 4ÿ5 billion years with the Andromeda Galaxy. It has been theorized that an elliptical galaxy will result from a merger of the two spirals. [better source needed]\\r\\nIt is believed that black holes may play an important role in limiting the growth of elliptical galaxies in the early universe by inhibiting star formation.[citation needed]","input":"What types of stars are found in elliptical galaxies?"},{"output":"a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently","context":"A solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently. It is also sometimes called solid-state disk;[1] the word \\"disk\\" is inappropriate since SSDs do not have physical disks. SSDs primarily use traditional hard disk drive (HDD) interfaces, such as SATA and SAS, greatly simplfying usage of SSDs in computers.[2] Following the initial acceptance of SSDs with HDD interfaces, new I/O interfaces like M.2 and U.2 have been designed to address specific requirements of the Flash memory technology used in SSDs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSSDs have no moving mechanical components. This distinguishes them from conventional electromechanical drives such as hard disk drives (HDDs) or floppy disks, which contain spinning disks and movable read/write heads.[3] Compared with electromechanical drives, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run silently, have quicker access time and lower latency.[4] However, while the price of SSDs has continued to decline over time, SSDs are (as of  2018[update]) still more expensive per unit of storage than HDDs and are expected to continue to be so into the next decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2017[update], most SSDs use 3D TLC NAND-based flash memory, which is a type of non-volatile memory that retains data when power is lost. For applications requiring fast access but not necessarily data persistence after power loss, SSDs may be constructed from random-access memory (RAM). Such devices may employ batteries as integrated power sources to retain data for a certain amount of time after external power is lost.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, all SSDs still store data in electrical charges, which slowly leak over time if left without power. This causes worn out drives (that have exceeded their endurance rating) to start losing data typically after one (if stored at 30?C) to two (at 25?C) years in storage; for new drives it takes longer.[5] Therefore, SSDs are not suited for archival purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHybrid drives or solid-state hybrid drives (SSHDs), such as Apple's Fusion Drive, combine the features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit, containing a large hard disk drive and an SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data.[6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn early if not first semiconductor storage device compatible with a hard drive interface (e.g. an SSD as defined) was the 1978 StorageTek 4305.  The StorageTek 4305, a plug-compatible replacement for the IBM 2305 fixed head disk drive, initially used charged coupled devices for storage and consequently was reported to be seven times faster than the IBM product at about half the price.[9] It later switched to DRAM. Prior to the StorageTek SSD there were many DRAM and core (e.g. DATARAM BULK Core, 1976[10])  products sold as alternatives to HDDs but these products typically had memory interfaces and were not SSDs as defined.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1980s Zitel, Inc., offered a family DRAM based SSD products, under the trade name \\"RAMDisk,\\" for use on systems by UNIVAC and Perkin-Elmer, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, SanDisk Corporation (then SunDisk) shipped the first SSD, a 20?MB solid state drive (SSD) which sold OEM for around $1,000.  It was used by IBM in a ThinkPad laptop[11] In 1995, STEC, Inc. entered the flash memory business for consumer electronic devices.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, M-Systems introduced flash-based solid-state drives[13] as HDD replacements for the military and aerospace industries, as well as for other mission-critical applications. These applications require the SSD's ability to withstand extreme shock, vibration and temperature ranges.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, BiTMICRO made a number of introductions and announcements about flash-based SSDs, including an 18?GB 3.5-inch SSD.[15] In 2007, Fusion-io announced a PCIe-based Solid state drive with 100,000?input/output operations per second (IOPS) of performance in a single card, with capacities up to 320?gigabytes.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Cebit 2009, OCZ Technology demonstrated a 1?terabyte (TB) flash SSD using a PCI Express G8 interface. It achieved a maximum write speed of 654?megabytes per second (MB/s) and maximum read speed of 712?MB/s.[17] In December 2009, Micron Technology announced an SSD using a 6?gigabits per second (Gbit/s) SATA interface.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise flash drives (EFDs) are designed for applications requiring high I/O performance (IOPS), reliability, energy efficiency and, more recently, consistent performance. In most cases, an EFD is an SSD with a higher set of specifications, compared with SSDs that would typically be used in notebook computers. The term was first used by EMC in January 2008, to help them identify SSD manufacturers who would provide products meeting these higher standards.[19] There are no standards bodies who control the definition of EFDs, so any SSD manufacturer may claim to produce EFDs when in fact the product may not actually meet any particular requirements.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example is the Intel DC?S3700 series of drives, introduced in the fourth quarter of 2012, which focuses on achieving consistent performance, an area that had previously not received much attention but which Intel claimed was important for the enterprise market. In particular, Intel claims that, at a steady state, the S3700 drives would not vary their IOPS by more than 10ÿ15%, and that 99.9% of all 4?KB random I/Os are serviced in less than 500?s.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother example is the Toshiba PX02SS enterprise SSD series, announced in 2016, which is optimized for use in server and storage platforms requiring high endurance from write-intensive applications such as write caching, I/O acceleration and online transaction processing (OLTP). The PX02SS series uses 12?Gbit/s SAS interface, featuring MLC NAND flash memory and achieving random write speeds of up to 42,000 IOPS, random read speeds of up to 130,000 IOPS, and endurance rating of 30 drive writes per day (DWPD).[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key components of an SSD are the controller and the memory to store the data. The primary memory component in an SSD was traditionally DRAM volatile memory, but since 2009 it is more commonly NAND flash non-volatile memory.[23][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery SSD includes a controller that incorporates the electronics that bridge the NAND memory components to the host computer. The controller is an embedded processor that executes firmware-level code and is one of the most important factors of SSD performance.[24] Some of the functions performed by the controller include:[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performance of an SSD can scale with the number of parallel NAND flash chips used in the device. A single NAND chip is relatively slow, due to the narrow (8/16?bit) asynchronous I/O interface, and additional high latency of basic I/O operations (typical for SLC NAND, ~25?s to fetch a 4?KB page from the array to the I/O buffer on a read, ~250?s to commit a 4?KB page from the IO buffer to the array on a write, ~2?ms to erase a 256?KB block). When multiple NAND devices operate in parallel inside an SSD, the bandwidth scales, and the high latencies can be hidden, as long as enough outstanding operations are pending and the load is evenly distributed between devices.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nMicron and Intel initially made faster SSDs by implementing data striping (similar to RAID 0) and interleaving in their architecture. This enabled the creation of ultra-fast SSDs with 250?MB/s effective read/write speeds with the SATA 3?Gbit/s interface in 2009.[28] Two years later, SandForce continued to leverage this parallel flash connectivity, releasing consumer-grade SATA 6?Gbit/s SSD controllers which supported 500?MB/s read/write speeds.[29] SandForce controllers compress the data prior to sending it to the flash memory. This process may result in less writing and higher logical throughput, depending on the compressibility of the data.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a particular block was programmed and erased repeatedly without writing to any other blocks, that block would wear out before all the other blocks  thereby prematurely ending the life of the SSD. For this reason, SSD controllers use a technique called wear leveling to distribute writes as evenly as possible across all the flash blocks in the SSD.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a perfect scenario, this would enable every block to be written to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly distribute writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces the life of the flash memory. The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost SSD manufacturers use non-volatile NAND flash memory in the construction of their SSDs because of the lower cost compared with DRAM and the ability to retain the data without a constant power supply, ensuring data persistence through sudden power outages.[34][35] Flash memory SSDs are slower than DRAM solutions, and some early designs were even slower than HDDs after continued use. This problem was resolved by controllers that came out in 2009 and later.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlash memory-based solutions are typically packaged in standard disk drive form factors (1.8-, 2.5-, and 3.5-inch), but also in smaller unique and compact layouts made possible by the small size of flash memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nLower-priced drives usually use triple-level cell (TLC) or multi-level cell (MLC) flash memory, which is slower and less reliable than single-level cell (SLC) flash memory.[37][38] This can be mitigated or even reversed by the internal design structure of the SSD, such as interleaving, changes to writing algorithms,[38] and higher over-provisioning (more excess capacity) with which the wear-leveling algorithms can work.[39][40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nSSDs based on volatile memory such as DRAM are characterized by very fast data access, generally less than 10?microseconds, and are used primarily to accelerate applications that would otherwise be held back by the latency of flash SSDs or traditional HDDs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDRAM-based SSDs usually incorporate either an internal battery or an external AC/DC adapter and backup storage systems to ensure data persistence while no power is being supplied to the drive from external sources. If power is lost, the battery provides power while all information is copied from random access memory (RAM) to back-up storage. When the power is restored, the information is copied back to the RAM from the back-up storage, and the SSD resumes normal operation (similar to the hibernate function used in modern operating systems).[42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nSSDs of this type are usually fitted with DRAM modules of the same type used in regular PCs and servers, which can be swapped out and replaced by larger modules.[44]\\r\\nSuch as i-RAM, HyperOs HyperDrive, DDRdrive X1, etc.\\r\\nSome manufacturers of DRAM SSDs solder the DRAM chips directly to the drive, and do not intend the chips to be swapped outsuch as ZeusRAM, Aeon Drive, etc.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nA remote, indirect memory-access disk (RIndMA Disk) uses a secondary computer with a fast network or (direct) Infiniband connection to act like a RAM-based SSD, but the new, faster, flash-memory based, SSDs already available in 2009 are making this option not as cost effective.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the price of DRAM continues to fall, the price of Flash memory falls even faster.\\r\\nThe \\"Flash becomes cheaper than DRAM\\" crossover point occurred approximately 2004.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome SSDs, called NVDIMM or Hyper DIMM devices, use both DRAM and flash memory. When the power goes down, the SSD copies all the data from its DRAM to flash; when the power comes back up, the SSD copies all the data from its flash to its DRAM.[49] In a somewhat similar way, some SSDs use form factors and buses actually designed for DIMM modules, while using only flash memory and making it appear as if it were DRAM. Such SSDs are usually known as ULLtraDIMM devices.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nDrives known as hybrid drives or solid-state hybrid drives (SSHDs) use a hybrid of spinning disks and flash memory.[51][52] Some SSDs use magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) for storing data.[53][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Intel and Micron announced 3D XPoint as a new non-volatile memory technology.[55] Intel plans to produce 3D XPoint SSDs with PCI Express interface in 2016,[56][needs update] which will operate faster and with higher endurance than NAND-based SSDs, while the areal density will be comparable at 128?gigabits per chip.[56][57][58][59] For the price per bit, 3D XPoint will be more expensive than NAND, but cheaper than DRAM.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nA flash-based SSD typically uses a small amount of DRAM as a volatile cache, similar to the buffers in hard disk drives. A directory of block placement and wear leveling data is also kept in the cache while the drive is operating.[27] One SSD controller manufacturer, SandForce, does not use an external DRAM cache on their designs but still achieves high performance. Such an elimination of the external DRAM reduces the power consumption and enables further size reduction of SSDs.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother component in higher-performing SSDs is a capacitor or some form of battery, which are necessary to maintain data integrity so the data in the cache can be flushed to the drive when power is lost; some may even hold power long enough to maintain data in the cache until power is resumed.[61][62] In the case of MLC flash memory, a problem called lower page corruption can occur when MLC flash memory loses power while programming an upper page. The result is that data written previously and presumed safe can be corrupted if the memory is not supported by a supercapacitor in the event of a sudden power loss. This problem does not exist with SLC flash memory.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost consumer-class SSDs do not have built-in batteries or capacitors;[63] among the exceptions are the Crucial M500 and MX100 series,[64] the Intel 320 series,[65] and the more expensive Intel 710 and 730 series.[66] Enterprise-class SSDs, such as the Intel DC?S3700 series,[67] usually have built-in batteries or capacitors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe host interface is physically a connector with the signalling managed by the SSD's controller. It is most often one of the interfaces found in HDDs. They include:\\r\\n\\r\\nSSDs support various logical device interfaces, such as the original ATAPI, Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI), NVM Express (NVMe), and other proprietary interfaces. Logical device interfaces define the command sets used by operating systems to communicate with SSDs and host bus adapters (HBAs).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size and shape of any device is largely driven by the size and shape of the components used to make that device. Traditional HDDs and optical drives are designed around the rotating platter(s) or optical disc along with the spindle motor inside. If an SSD is made up of various interconnected integrated circuits (ICs) and an interface connector, then its shape is no longer limited to the shape of rotating media drives. Some solid state storage solutions come in a larger chassis that may even be a rack-mount form factor with numerous SSDs inside. They would all connect to a common bus inside the chassis and connect outside the box with a single connector.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor general computer use, the 2.5-inch form factor (typically found in laptops) is the most popular. For desktop computers with 3.5-inch hard disk drive slots, a simple adapter plate can be used to make such a drive fit. Other types of form factors are more common in enterprise applications. An SSD can also be completely integrated in the other circuitry of the device, as in the Apple MacBook Air (starting with the fall 2010 model).[76] As of  2014[update], mSATA and M.2 form factors are also gaining popularity, primarily in laptops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe benefit of using a current HDD form factor would be to take advantage of the extensive infrastructure already in place to mount and connect the drives to the host system.[2][77] These traditional form factors are known by the size of the rotating media, e.g., 5.25-inch, 3.5-inch, 2.5-inch, 1.8-inch, not by the dimensions of the drive casing.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor applications where space is at premium, like for ultrabooks or tablet computers, a few compact form factors were standardized for flash-based SSDs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is the mSATA form factor, which uses the PCI Express Mini Card physical layout. It remains electrically compatible with the PCI Express Mini Card interface specification, while requiring an additional connection to the SATA host controller through the same connector.\\r\\n\\r\\nM.2 form factor, formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF), is a natural transition from the mSATA and physical layout it used, to a more usable and more advanced form factor. While mSATA took advantage of an existing form factor and connector, M.2 has been designed to maximize usage of the card space, while minimizing the footprint. The M.2 standard allows both SATA and PCI Express SSDs to be fitted onto M.2 modules.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nA disk-on-a-module (DOM) is a flash drive with either 40/44-pin Parallel ATA (PATA) or SATA interface, intended to be plugged directly into the motherboard and used as a computer hard disk drive (HDD). DOM devices emulate a traditional hard disk drive, resulting in no need for special drivers or other specific operating system support. DOMs are usually used in embedded systems, which are often deployed in harsh environments where mechanical HDDs would simply fail, or in thin clients because of small size, low power consumption and silent operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2016[update], storage capacities range from 64?GB to 128?GB with different variations in physical layouts, including vertical or horizontal orientation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the DRAM-based solutions use a box that is often designed to fit in a rack-mount system. The number of DRAM components required to get sufficient capacity to store the data along with the backup power supplies requires a larger space than traditional HDD form factors.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nViking Technology SATA Cube and AMP SATA Bridge multi-layer SSDs\\r\\n\\r\\nViking Technology SATADIMM based SSD\\r\\n\\r\\nMO-297 SATA disk-on-a-module (DOM) SSD form factor\\r\\n\\r\\nA custom-connector SATA SSD\\r\\n\\r\\nForm factors which were more common to memory modules are now being used by SSDs to take advantage of their flexibility in laying out the components. Some of these include PCIe, mini PCIe, mini-DIMM, MO-297, and many more.[81] The SATADIMM from Viking Technology uses an empty DDR3 DIMM slot on the motherboard to provide power to the SSD with a separate SATA connector to provide the data connection back to the computer. The result is an easy-to-install SSD with a capacity equal to drives that typically take a full 2.5-inch drive bay.[82] At least one manufacturer, Innodisk, has produced a drive that sits directly on the SATA connector (SATADOM) on the motherboard without any need for a power cable.[83] Some SSDs are based on the PCIe form factor and connect both the data interface and power through the PCIe connector to the host. These drives can use either direct PCIe flash controllers[84] or a PCIe-to-SATA bridge device which then connects to SATA flash controllers.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 2000s, a few companies introduced SSDs in Ball Grid Array (BGA) form factors, such as M-Systems' (now SanDisk) DiskOnChip[86] and Silicon Storage Technology's NANDrive[87][88] (now produced by Greenliant Systems), and Memoright's M1000[89] for use in embedded systems. The main benefits of BGA SSDs are their low power consumption, small chip package size to fit into compact subsystems, and that they can be soldered directly onto a system motherboard to reduce adverse effects from vibration and shock.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking a comparison between SSDs and ordinary (spinning) HDDs is difficult. Traditional SSD benchmarks tend to focus on the performance characteristics that are poor with HDDs, such as rotational latency and seek time. As SSDs do not need to spin or seek to locate data, they may prove vastly superior to HDDs in such tests. However, SSDs have challenges with mixed reads and writes, and their performance may degrade over time. SSD testing must start from the (in use) full drive, as the new and empty (fresh, out-of-the-box) drive may have much better write performance than it would show after only weeks of use.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the advantages of solid-state drives over traditional hard drives are due to their ability to access data completely electronically instead of electromechanically, resulting in superior transfer speeds and mechanical ruggedness.[92] On the other hand, hard disk drives offer significantly higher capacity for their price.[4][93]\\r\\n\\r\\nField failure rates indicate that SSDs are significantly more reliable than HDDs.[94][95][96] However, SSDs are uniquely sensitive to sudden power interruption, resulting in aborted writes or even cases of the complete loss of the drive.[97] The reliability of both HDDs and SSDs varies greatly among models.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with HDDs, there is a tradeoff between cost and performance of different SSDs. Single-level cell (SLC) SSDs, while significantly more expensive than multi-level (MLC) SSDs, offer a significant speed advantage.[35] At the same time, DRAM-based solid-state storage is currently considered the fastest and most costly, with average response times of 10 microseconds instead of the average 100 microseconds of other SSDs. Enterprise flash devices (EFDs) are designed to handle the demands of tier-1 application with performance and response times similar to less-expensive SSDs.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn traditional HDDs, a re-written file will generally occupy the same location on the disk surface as the original file, whereas in SSDs the new copy will often be written to different NAND cells for the purpose of wear leveling. The wear-leveling algorithms are complex and difficult to test exhaustively; as a result, one major cause of data loss in SSDs is firmware bugs.[100][101]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table shows a detailed overview of the advantages and disadvantages of both technologies. Comparisons reflect typical characteristics, and may not hold for a specific device.\\r\\n\\r\\nSSD technology can deliver rather consistent read/write speed, but when lots of individual smaller blocks are accessed, performance is reduced. SSDs suffer from a write performance degradation phenomenon called write amplification, where the NAND cells show a measurable drop in performance, and will continue degrading throughout the life of the SSD.[108] A technique called wear leveling is implemented to mitigate this effect, but due to the nature of the NAND chips, the drive will inevitably degrade at a noticeable rate.[verification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a study performed by Carnegie Mellon University for both consumer and enterprise-grade HDDs, their average failure rate is 6 years, and life expectancy is 9ÿ11 years.[138] Leading SSDs have overtaken HDDs for reliability,[94] however the risk of a sudden, catastrophic data loss can be lower for HDDs.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen stored offline (unpowered in shelf) in long term, the magnetic medium of HDD retains data significantly longer than flash memory used in SSDs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSSD price as of first quarter 2018 around 30 cents (US) per gigabyte based on 4 TB models.[143]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrices have generally declined annually and as of 2018 are expected to continue to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrices have generally declined annually and as of 2018 are expected to continue to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile both memory cards and most SSDs use flash memory, they serve very different markets and purposes. Each has a number of different attributes which are optimized and adjusted to best meet the needs of particular users. Some of these characteristics include power consumption, performance, size, and reliability.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nSSDs were originally designed for use in a computer system. The first units were intended to replace or augment hard disk drives, so the operating system recognized them as a hard drive. Originally, solid state drives were even shaped and mounted in the computer like hard drives. Later SSDs became smaller and more compact, eventually developing their own unique form factors such as M.2 form factor. The SSD was designed to be installed permanently inside a computer.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, memory cards (such as Secure Digital (SD), CompactFlash (CF), and many others) were originally designed for digital cameras and later found their way into cell phones, gaming devices, GPS units, etc. Most memory cards are physically smaller than SSDs, and designed to be inserted and removed repeatedly.[152] There are adapters which enable some memory cards to interface to a computer, allowing use as an SSD, but they are not intended to be the primary storage device in the computer. The typical CompactFlash card interface is three to four times slower than an SSD.[citation needed] As memory cards are not designed to tolerate the amount of reading and writing which occurs during typical computer use, their data may get damaged unless special procedures are taken to reduce the wear on the card to a minimum.\\r\\n\\r\\nSSDs have very different failure modes than traditional magnetic hard drives. Because of their design, some kinds of failure are inapplicable (motors or magnetic heads cannot fail, because they are not needed in an SSD). Instead, other kinds of failure are possible (for example, incomplete or failed writes due to sudden power failure can be more of a problem than with HDDs, and if a chip fails then all the data on it is lost, a scenario not applicable to magnetic drives). However, on the whole statistics show that SSDs are generally highly reliable, and often continue working far beyond the expected lifetime as stated by their manufacturer.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn early test by Techreport.com which ran for 18 months during 2013 - 2015 had previously tested a number of SSDs to destruction to identify how and at what point they failed; the test found that \\"All of the drives surpassed their official endurance specifications by writing hundreds of terabytes without issue\\", described as being far beyond any usual size for a \\"typical consumer\\".[154] The first SSD to fail was a TLC based drive - a type of design expected to be less durable than either SLC or MLC - and the SSD concerned managed to write over 800,000 GB (800 TB or 0.8 petabytes) before failing; three SSDs in the test managed to write almost three times that amount (almost 2.5 PB) before they also failed.[154] So the capability of even consumer SSDs to be remarkably reliable was already established.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2016 study of \\"millions of drive days\\" in production use by SSDs over a six-year period, found that SSDs fail at a \\"significantly lower\\" rate than HDDs, but have potential for localized data loss due to unreadable blocks to be more of a problem than with HDDs. It came to a number of \\"unexpected conclusions\\":[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolid state drives have set new challenges for data recovery companies, as the way of storing data is non-linear and much more complex than that of hard disk drives. The strategy the drive operates by internally can largely vary between manufacturers, and the TRIM command zeroes the whole range of a deleted file. Wear leveling also means that the physical address of the data and the address exposed to the operating system are different.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for secure deletion of data, ATA Secure Erase command could be used. A program such as hdparm can be used for this purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe JEDEC Solid State Technology Association (JEDEC) has published standards for reliability metrics:[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 2009[why?], SSDs were mainly used in those aspects of mission critical applications where the speed of the storage system needed to be as high as possible. Since flash memory has become a common component of SSDs, the falling prices and increased densities have made it more cost-effective for many other applications. Organizations that can benefit from faster access of system data include equity trading companies, telecommunication corporations, and streaming media and video editing firms. The list of applications which could benefit from faster storage is vast.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlash-based solid-state drives can be used to create network appliances from general-purpose personal computer hardware. A write protected flash drive containing the operating system and application software can substitute for larger, less reliable disk drives or CD-ROMs. Appliances built this way can provide an inexpensive alternative to expensive router and firewall hardware.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSSDs based on an SD card with a live SD operating system are easily write-locked. Combined with a cloud computing environment or other writable medium, to maintain persistence, an OS booted from a write-locked SD card is robust, rugged, reliable, and impervious to permanent corruption. If the running OS degrades, simply turning the machine off and then on returns it back to its initial uncorrupted state and thus is particularly solid. The SD card installed OS does not require removal of corrupted components since it was write-locked though any written media may need to be restored.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, Intel introduced a caching mechanism for their Z68 chipset (and mobile derivatives) called Smart Response Technology, which allows a SATA SSD to be used as a cache (configurable as write-through or write-back) for a conventional, magnetic hard disk drive.[156] A similar technology is available on HighPoint's RocketHybrid PCIe card.[157]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolid-state hybrid drives (SSHDs) are based on the same principle, but integrate some amount of flash memory on board of a conventional drive instead of using a separate SSD. The flash layer in these drives can be accessed independently from the magnetic storage by the host using ATA-8 commands, allowing the operating system to manage it. For example, Microsoft's ReadyDrive technology explicitly stores portions of the hibernation file in the cache of these drives when the system hibernates, making the subsequent resume faster.[158]\\r\\n\\r\\nDual-drive hybrid systems are combining the usage of separate SSD and HDD devices installed in the same computer, with overall performance optimization managed by the computer user, or by the computer's operating system software. Examples of this type of system are bcache and dm-cache on Linux,[159] and Apples Fusion Drive.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically the same file systems used on hard disk drives can also be used on solid state drives. It is usually expected for the file system to support the TRIM command which helps the SSD to recycle discarded data (support for TRIM arrived some years after SSDs themselves but is now nearly universal). This means that file system does not need to manage wear leveling or other flash memory characteristics, as they are handled internally by the SSD. Some flash file systems using log-based designs (F2FS, JFFS2) help to reduce write amplification on SSDs, especially in situations where only very small amounts of data are changed, such as when updating file system metadata.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile not a file system feature, operating systems should also aim to align partitions correctly, which avoids excessive read-modify-write cycles. A typical practice for personal computers is to have each partition aligned to start at a 1?MB (= 1,048,576 bytes) mark, which covers all common SSD page and block size scenarios, as it is divisible by all commonly used sizes - 1?MB, 512?KB, 128?KB, 4?KB, and 512?bytes. Modern operating system installation software and disk tools handle this automatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ext4, Btrfs, XFS, JFS, and F2FS file systems include support for the discard (TRIM or UNMAP) function. As of November 2013, ext4 can be recommended as a safe choice.[by whom?] F2FS is a modern file system optimized for flash-based storage, and from a technical perspective is a very good choice,[according to whom?] but is still in experimental stage.[when?][citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nKernel support for the TRIM operation was introduced in version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline, released on 24 February 2010.[160] To make use of it, a filesystem must be mounted using the discard parameter. Linux swap partitions are by default performing discard operations when the underlying drive supports TRIM, with the possibility to turn them off, or to select between one-time or continuous discard operations.[161][162][163] Support for queued TRIM, which is a SATA?3.1 feature that results in TRIM commands not disrupting the command queues, was introduced in Linux kernel 3.12, released on November 2, 2013.[164]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative to the kernel-level TRIM operation is to use a user-space utility called fstrim that goes through all of the unused blocks in a filesystem and dispatches TRIM commands for those areas. fstrim utility is usually run by cron as a scheduled task. As of  November?2013[update], it is used by the Ubuntu Linux distribution, in which it is enabled only for Intel and Samsung solid-state drives for reliability reasons; vendor check can be disabled by editing file /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim using instructions contained within the file itself.[165]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2010, standard Linux drive utilities have taken care of appropriate partition alignment by default.[166]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring installation, Linux distributions usually do not configure the installed system to use TRIM and thus the /etc/fstab file requires manual modifications.[167] This is because of the notion that the current Linux TRIM command implementation might not be optimal.[168] It has been proven to cause a performance degradation instead of a performance increase under certain circumstances.[169][170] As of  January?2014[update], Linux sends an individual TRIM command to each sector, instead of a vectorized list defining a TRIM range as recommended by the TRIM specification.[171] This deficiency has existed for years and there are no known plans to eliminate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor performance reasons, it is recommended to switch the I/O scheduler from the default CFQ (Completely Fair Queuing) to NOOP or Deadline. CFQ was designed for traditional magnetic media and seek optimizations, thus many of those I/O scheduling efforts are wasted when used with SSDs. As part of their designs, SSDs offer much bigger levels of parallelism for I/O operations, so it is preferable to leave scheduling decisions to their internal logic?ÿ  especially for high-end SSDs.[172][173]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA scalable block layer for high-performance SSD storage, known as blk-multiqueue or blk-mq and developed primarily by Fusion-io engineers, was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 3.13, released on 19 January 2014. This leverages the performance offered by SSDs and NVM Express, by allowing much higher I/O submission rates. With this new design of the Linux kernel block layer, internal queues are split into two levels (per-CPU and hardware-submission queues), thus removing bottlenecks and allowing much higher levels of I/O parallelization. As of version 4.0 of the Linux kernel, released on 12 April 2015, VirtIO block driver, the SCSI layer (which is used by Serial ATA drivers), device mapper framework, loop device driver, unsorted block images (UBI) driver (which implements erase block management layer for flash memory devices) and RBD driver (which exports Ceph RADOS objects as block devices) have been modified to actually use this new interface; other drivers will be ported in the following releases.[174][175][176][177][178]\\r\\n\\r\\nOS?X versions since 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) support TRIM but only when used with an Apple-purchased SSD.[179] TRIM is not automatically enabled for third-party drives, although it can be enabled by using third-party utilities such as Trim Enabler. The status of TRIM can be checked in the System Information application or in the system_profiler command-line tool.\\r\\n\\r\\nOS?X version 10.11 (El Capitan) and 10.10.4 (Yosemite) include sudo trimforce enable as a Terminal command that enables TRIM on non-Apple SSDs.[180] There is also a technique to enable TRIM in versions of OS?X earlier than 10.6.8, although it remains uncertain whether TRIM is actually utilized properly in those cases.[181]\\r\\n\\r\\nVersions of Microsoft Windows prior to 7 do not take any special measures to support solid state drives. Starting from Windows 7, the standard NTFS file system provides TRIM support (other file systems on Windows do not support TRIM[182]).\\r\\n\\r\\nBy default, Windows?7 and newer versions execute TRIM commands automatically if the device is detected to be a solid-state drive. To change this behavior, in the Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\FileSystem the value DisableDeleteNotification can be set to 1 to prevent the mass storage driver from issuing the TRIM command. This can be useful in situations where data recovery is preferred over wear leveling (in most cases, TRIM irreversibly resets all freed space).[183]\\r\\n\\r\\nWindows implements TRIM command for more than just file delete operations. The TRIM operation is fully integrated with partition- and volume-level commands like format and delete, with file system commands relating to truncate and compression, and with the System Restore (also known as Volume Snapshot) feature.[184]\\r\\n\\r\\nWindows?7 and later versions have native support for SSDs.[184][185] The operating system detects the presence of an SSD and optimizes operation accordingly. For SSD devices Windows disables SuperFetch and ReadyBoost, boot-time and application prefetching operations.[citation needed] Despite the initial statement by Steven Sinofsky prior to the release of Windows 7,[184] however, defragmentation is not disabled, even though its behavior on SSDs differs.[114] One reason is the low performance of Volume Shadow Copy Service on fragmented SSDs.[114] The second reason is to avoid reaching the practical maximum number of file fragments that a volume can handle. If this maximum is reached, subsequent attempts to write to the drive will fail with an error message.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nWindows 7 also includes support for the TRIM command to reduce garbage collection for data which the operating system has already determined is no longer valid. Without support for TRIM, the SSD would be unaware of this data being invalid and would unnecessarily continue to rewrite it during garbage collection causing further wear on the SSD. It is beneficial to make some changes that prevent SSDs from being treated more like HDDs, for example cancelling defragmentation, not filling them to more than about 75% of capacity, not storing frequently written-to files such as log and temporary files on them if a hard drive is available, and enabling the TRIM process.[186][187]\\r\\n\\r\\nWindows Vista generally expects hard disk drives rather than SSDs.[188][189] Windows Vista includes ReadyBoost to exploit characteristics of USB-connected flash devices, but for SSDs it only improves the default partition alignment to prevent read-modify-write operations that reduce the speed of SSDs. Most SSDs are typically split into 4?kB sectors, while most systems are based on 512?byte sectors with their default partition setups unaligned to the 4?KB boundaries.[190] The proper alignment does not help the SSD's endurance over the life of the drive; however, some Vista operations, if not disabled, can shorten the life of the SSD.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrive defragmentation should be disabled because the location of the file components on an SSD doesn't significantly impact its performance, but moving the files to make them contiguous using the Windows Defrag routine will cause unnecessary write wear on the limited number of P/E cycles on the SSD. The Superfetch feature will not materially improve the performance of the system and causes additional overhead in the system and SSD, although it does not cause wear.[191] Windows Vista does not send the TRIM command to solid state drives, but some third part utilities such as SSD Doctor will periodically scan the drive and TRIM the appropriate entries.[192]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolaris as of version 10 Update 6 (released in October 2008), and recent[when?] versions of OpenSolaris, Solaris Express Community Edition, Illumos, Linux with ZFS on Linux, and FreeBSD all can use SSDs as a performance booster for ZFS. A low-latency SSD can be used for the ZFS Intent Log (ZIL), where it is named the SLOG. This is used every time a synchronous write to the drive occurs. An SSD (not necessarily with a low-latency) may also be used for the level 2 Adaptive Replacement Cache (L2ARC), which is used to cache data for reading. When used either alone or in combination, large increases in performance are generally seen.[193]\\r\\n\\r\\nZFS for FreeBSD introduced support for TRIM on September 23, 2012.[194] The code builds a map of regions of data that were freed; on every write the code consults the map and eventually removes ranges that were freed before, but are now overwritten. There is a low-priority thread that TRIMs ranges when the time comes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso the Unix File System (UFS) supports the TRIM command.[195]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following are noted standardization organizations and bodies that work to create standards for solid-state drives (and other computer storage devices). The table below also includes organizations which promote the use of solid-state drives. This is not necessarily an exhaustive list.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolid-state drive technology has been marketed to the military and niche industrial markets since the mid-1990s.[199]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the emerging enterprise market, SSDs have been appearing in ultra-mobile PCs and a few lightweight laptop systems, adding significantly to the price of the laptop, depending on the capacity, form factor and transfer speeds. For low-end applications, a USB flash drive may be obtainable for anywhere from $10 to $100 or so, depending on capacity and speed; alternatively, a CompactFlash card may be paired with a CF-to-IDE or CF-to-SATA converter at a similar cost. Either of these requires that write-cycle endurance issues be managed, either by refraining from storing frequently written files on the drive or by using a flash file system. Standard CompactFlash cards usually have write speeds of 7 to 15?MB/s while the more expensive upmarket cards claim speeds of up to 60?MB/s.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first mainstream releases of SSD was the XO Laptop, built as part of the One Laptop Per Child project. Mass production of these computers, built for children in developing countries, began in December 2007. These machines use 1,024?MiB SLC NAND flash as primary storage which is considered more suitable for the harsher than normal conditions in which they are expected to be used. Dell began shipping ultra-portable laptops with SanDisk SSDs on April 26, 2007.[200] Asus released the Eee PC subnotebook on October 16, 2007, with 2, 4 or 8 gigabytes of flash memory.[201] On January 31, 2008, Apple released the MacBook Air, a thin laptop with an optional 64?GB SSD. The Apple Store cost was $999 more for this option, as compared with that of an 80?GB 4200?RPM hard disk drive.[202] Another option, the Lenovo ThinkPad X300 with a 64?gigabyte SSD, was announced by Lenovo in February 2008.[203] On August 26, 2008, Lenovo released ThinkPad X301 with 128?GB SSD option which adds approximately $200 US.[204]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, low-end netbooks appeared with SSDs. In 2009, SSDs began to appear in laptops.[200][202]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 14, 2008, EMC Corporation (EMC) became the first enterprise storage vendor to ship flash-based SSDs into its product portfolio when it announced it had selected STEC, Inc.'s Zeus-IOPS SSDs for its Symmetrix DMX systems.[205] In 2008, Sun released the Sun Storage 7000 Unified Storage Systems (codenamed Amber Road), which use both solid state drives and conventional hard drives to take advantage of the speed offered by SSDs and the economy and capacity offered by conventional HDDs.[206]\\r\\n\\r\\nDell began to offer optional 256?GB solid state drives on select notebook models in January 2009.[207][208] In May 2009, Toshiba launched a laptop with a 512?GB SSD.[209][210]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince October 2010, Apple's MacBook Air line has used a solid state drive as standard.[211] In December 2010, OCZ RevoDrive X2 PCIe SSD was available in 100?GB to 960?GB capacities delivering speeds over 740?MB/s sequential speeds and random small file writes up to 120,000?IOPS.[212] In November 2010, Fusion-io released its highest performing SSD drive named ioDrive Octal utilising PCI-Express x16 Gen 2.0 interface with storage space of 5.12?TB, read speed of 6.0?GB/s, write speed of 4.4?GB/s and a low latency of 30?microseconds. It has 1.19?M Read 512 byte IOPS and 1.18?M Write 512 byte IOPS.[213]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, computers based on Intel's Ultrabook specifications became available. These specifications dictate that Ultrabooks use an SSD. These are consumer-level devices (unlike many previous flash offerings aimed at enterprise users), and represent the first widely available consumer computers using SSDs aside from the MacBook Air.[214] At CES 2012, OCZ Technology demonstrated the R4 CloudServ PCIe SSDs capable of reaching transfer speeds of 6.5?GB/s and 1.4?million IOPS.[215] Also announced was the Z-Drive R5 which is available in capacities up to 12?TB, capable of reaching transfer speeds of 7.2?GB/s and 2.52?million IOPS using the PCI Express x16 Gen 3.0.[216]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2013, Samsung introduced and launched the industry's first 1?TB mSATA SSD.[217] In August 2015, Samsung announced a 16?TB SSD, at the time the world's highest-capacity single storage device of any type.[218]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, performance of any particular device can vary significantly in different operating conditions. For example, the number of parallel threads accessing the storage device, the I/O block size, and the amount of free space remaining can all dramatically change the performance (i.e. transfer rates) of the device.[219]\\r\\n\\r\\nSSD technology has been developing rapidly. Most of the performance measurements used on disk drives with rotating media are also used on SSDs. Performance of flash-based SSDs is difficult to benchmark because of the wide range of possible conditions. In a test performed in 2010 by Xssist, using IOmeter, 4?kB random 70% read/30% write, queue depth 4, the IOPS delivered by the Intel X25-E 64?GB G1 started around 10,000?IOPs, and dropped sharply after 8?minutes to 4,000?IOPS, and continued to decrease gradually for the next 42?minutes. IOPS vary between 3,000 and 4,000 from around 50?minutes onwards for the rest of the 8+ hour test run.[220]\\r\\n\\r\\nWrite amplification is the major reason for the change in performance of an SSD over time. Designers of enterprise-grade drives try to avoid this performance variation by increasing over-provisioning, and by employing wear-leveling algorithms that move data only when the drives are not heavily utilized.[221]\\r\\n\\r\\nSSD shipments were 11 million units in 2009,[222] 17.3 million units in 2011[223] for a total of US$5 billion,[224] 39 million units in 2012, and are expected to rise to 83 million units in 2013[225]\\r\\nto 201.4 million units in 2016[223]\\r\\nand to 227 million units in 2017.[226]\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenues for the SSD market (including low-cost PC solutions) worldwide totalled $585 million in 2008, rising over 100% from $259 million in 2007.[227]","input":"What is a solid state external hard drive?"},{"output":"millions of years","context":"Petrified wood (from the Greek root petro meaning \\"rock\\" or \\"stone\\"; literally \\"wood turned into stone\\") is the name given to a special type of fossilized remains of terrestrial vegetation. It is the result of a tree or tree-like plants having completely transitioned to stone by the process of permineralization. All the organic materials have been replaced with minerals (mostly a silicate, such as quartz), while retaining the original structure of the stem tissue. Unlike other types of fossils which are typically impressions or compressions, petrified wood is a three-dimensional representation of the original organic material. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe petrifaction process occurs underground, when wood becomes buried under sediment or volcanic ash and is initially preserved due to a lack of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition. Mineral-laden water flowing through the covering material deposits minerals in the plant's cells; as the plant's lignin and cellulose decay, a stone mold forms in its place. The organic matter needs to become petrified before it decomposes completely.[1] The process lasts millions of years.[2] A forest where such material has petrified becomes known as a petrified forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nElements such as manganese, iron, and copper in the water/mud during the petrification process give petrified wood a variety of color ranges.

This petrification process generally results in a quartz chalcedony mineralization. Special rare conditions must be met in order for the fallen stem to be transformed into fossil wood or petrified wood. In general, the fallen plants get buried in an environment free of oxygen (anaerobic environment), which preserves the original plant structure and general appearance. The other conditions include a regular access to mineral rich water in contact with the tissues, replacing the organic plant structure with inorganic minerals. The end result is petrified wood, a plant, with its original basic structure in place, replaced by stone.

It represents the historic county of Hampshire. Hampshire teams formed by earlier organisations, principally the Hambledon Club, always had important match status and so the county club was rated accordingly from its inception in 1863 until 1885. Because of poor performances for several seasons, Hampshire then lost its status for nine seasons until it was invited into the County Championship in 1895.[1][2] Hampshire is classified as an official first-class team from 1895 by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the County Championship clubs;[3] classified as a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963;[4] and classified as a senior Twenty20 team since 2003.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club was founded in 1863 and played at the Antelope Ground, Southampton until 1885. They relocated to the County Ground, Southampton until 2000, before moving to the purpose-built Rose Bowl in West End, which is in the Borough of Eastleigh. Hampshire played its first important match in 1864, losing to Sussex at the Antelope Ground. Hampshire had poor results for many seasons and lost its important match status in 1885. They achieved official first-class status in 1895 when they were invited to join the County Championship. The club has twice won the County Championship, in the 1961 and 1973 seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nHampshire played their first one-day match in the 1963 Gillette Cup, but did not win their first one-day silverware until 1975 when they won the Sunday League which it won twice more, in 1978 and 1986.  It has twice won the Benson & Hedges Cup, in 1988 and 1991; the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy once in 2005 and the Friends Provident Trophy once in 2009.  Having first played Twenty20 cricket in 2003, Hampshire won the Friends Provident t20 in 2010.  The County Championship was restructured in 2000, and at the end of the 2002 Hampshire was relegated for the first time. The club remained in the second division for three seasons and since 2004 had competed in the top tier.  However, the club was relegated once more in 2011. The club won both the Friends Life t20 and ECB 40 in 2012, but it wasn't until 2014 before they were promoted to the first division again. They narrowly avoided relegation in 2015 before being relegated again in 2016, only to be reprieved after Durham were relegated after taking ECB sanctions to secure their future.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhil Mead is the club's leading run-scorer with 48,892?runs in 700?matches for Hampshire between 1905 and 1936. Fast bowler Derek Shackleton took 2,669?wickets in 583?first-class matches between 1948 and 1969 which remains a club record.  Alec Kennedy, whose career lasted from 1907 to 1936, was the first player to score 10,000?runs and take 1,000?wickets for Hampshire.  Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie was both Hampshire last amateur captain and first professional captain.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Latin poem by Robert Matthew in 1647 contains a probable reference to cricket being played by pupils of Winchester College on nearby St. Catherines Hill.  If authentic, this is the earliest known mention of cricket in Hampshire.  But, with the sport having originated in Saxon or Norman times on the Weald, it must have reached Hampshire long before 1647.  In 1680, lines written in an old Bible invite \\"All you that do delight in Cricket, come to Marden, pitch your wickets\\".  Marden is in Sussex, north of Chichester, and close to Hambledon, which is just across the county boundary in Hampshire.  Hampshire is used in a team name for the first time in August 1729, when a combined Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex XI played against Kent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the legendary Hambledon Club is lost.  There remains no definite knowledge of Hambledon cricket before 1756, when its team had gained sufficient repute to be capable of attempting three matches against Dartford, itself a famous club since the 1720s if not earlier. Hambledon had presumably earned recognition as the best parish team in Hampshire, but no reports of their local matches have been found. We do not know when the Hambledon Club was founded and it seems likely that some kind of parish organisation was operating in 1756, although there may well have been a patron involved.  The Sussex v Hampshire match in June 1766 is the earliest reference to Hampshire as an individual county team.  Whether the Hambledon Club was involved is unrecorded but presumably it was. Some historians believe it was at about this time that the club, as distinct from a parish organisation, was founded.  The Hambledon Club was in many respects a Hampshire county club for it organised Hampshire matches, although it was a multi-functional club and not dedicated to cricket alone. Its membership attracted large numbers of sporting gentry and it dominated the sport, both on and off the field, for about thirty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club in 1787. Hambledon produced some legendary Hampshire players including master batsman John Small and the two great fast bowlers Thomas Brett and David Harris.  Following the demise of the Hambledon Club towards the end of the 18th century, Hampshire continued to be recognised as an important county into the 19th century. But after the 1828 season, Hampshire had long spells without any important matches until the county club was founded in 1864. The county played some important fixtures during 1842 to 1845 and one match versus MCC in 1861 but was otherwise outside crickets mainstream through 1829 to 1863.\\r\\n\\r\\nHampshire County Cricket Club was founded on 12 August 1863[7] and played its first important match against Sussex at the Antelope Ground, Southampton on 7 and 8 July 1864. Sussex won by 10 wickets with James Lillywhite claiming ten wickets in the match for 80 runs, including his 100th career wicket.[8] Hampshire was recognised as an important/first-class team from 1864 to 1885. In 1886, Hampshire lost its status after years of difficult circumstances and poor results. The team did play against Surrey and Sussex in 1886 but the matches were considered minor standard. Hampshire recovered first-class status from the beginning of the 1895 County Championship season when the team was invited to join the now official County Championship. They finished the season in tenth place, sixteen points behind winners Surrey.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1900 and 1905, Hampshire were almost continuously struggling as their key officer-batsmen, Major Poore and Captain Wynyard were faced with either moving to South Africa or increased military duties at home from the Boer War. The club finished last or equal last in 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904 and 1905, failing to win a single game in the first of those seasons; however in 1901, with the temporary acquisition of Captain Greig from India and the qualification of Charlie Llewellyn, Hampshire won as many games as it lost. From 1906 onwards, with the qualification of Phil Mead, Jack Newman and later George Brown, Hampshire became a much more competitive side, though not until 1910 did they win as many games as they lost in a season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period from 1912 to 1926, though they never got near County Championship honours, was to be the most successful for a long time in Hampshires history: in those eleven seasons they won 98 and lost 96 of 292 games ÿ only once otherwise until 1954 did they win more games than they lost.[10] Mead, Brown, Kennedy and Newman were in the prime during this period, and they had the services of Lord Tennyson who captained the side from 1919ÿ1932 as well as captaining the England team in three Tests, and the occasional aid of many other amateurs including the great C. B. Fry, who averaged an amazing 102 in seven games during 1912. In 1922, Hampshire won one of the most remarkable victories in County Championship history when, they defeated Warwickshire by 155 runs after having followed on when dismissed for just 15. They scored 521 after being invited to bat again, set Warwickshire 314 to win and bowled them out for 158. Brown, with 172, and Livsey who scored 110* at number 10, were the heroes.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1927, Hampshire declined severely as their stalwart professionals declined and the level of amateur support fell off alarmingly. Only in 1932 and 1948 did they finish above tenth until 1955. With Stuart Boyes and Lofty Herman not fully adequate replacements as bowling mainstays for Kennedy and Newman, the bowling was never strong, and the batting generally uncertain especially when Mead declined from 1929 onwards. In 1937 Dick Moore set the individual scoring record for Hampshire against Warwickshire at Dean Park Cricket Ground in Bournemouth. His 316 took just 380 minutes and contained 43 fours and three sixes.[12] After World War II, Derek Shackleton became an outstanding bowling mainstay well backed up by Victor Cannings, but not until 1955 did these two have enough support to rise the fortunes of the club. In 1955 Hampshire finished as high as third with Shackleton taking 160 wickets and Cannings and Peter Sainsbury around 100, with Roy Marshall was one of the few exciting batsmen of the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following years were mixed: a rise to second in 1958 with Malcolm Heath replacing Cannings as Shackletons partner was followed by two disappointing years before Hampshire won the 1961 County Championship, their first ever County Championship success, finishing the season with 268 points, 18 ahead of Yorkshire. Hampshire won 19 of their 32 matches, losing only seven matches all season.[13] The club were led by Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie with Marshall scoring the most runs for the club with 2,455. Derek Shackleton took the most wickets for the club with 153, and Butch Whites tearaway speed was equally dangerous in a dry summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, however, Hampshire were disappointing until Barry Richards joined the county in 1968, when they rose from tenth to fifth in the Championship and established themselves as a power in limited-overs cricket. Bob Cottam was the second-highest first-class wicket-taker in 1968 and the highest in 1969, but did not maintain this excellence before joining Northamptonshire and in 1970 and 1971 Hampshire fell to mid-table. In the 1973 County Championship Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time, winning the competition by 31 points from Surrey.[14] The club won 10 of their 20 matches and drew the other 10. During this season they were led by Richard Gilliat with Gordon Greenidge scoring the most runs for the club with 1,620. Bob Herman and Mike Taylor both took 63 wickets. This remains Hampshire's last success in the tournament.  In 1979 West Indian Malcolm Marshall, widely regarded as one of the best bowlers to grace the game joined the club. This was to be the start of a 14-year stay with the club. During that time Marshall would go on to take 824 first-class wickets at an anverage of 18.64[15] and 239 wickets at 24.88 in one-day cricket.[16] 1984 also saw the last game of Venezuelan  captain Nick Pocock (Maracaibo, 1951) and the  arrival of another West Indian, Cardigan Connor who would spend 14 years with the club. Regarded as one of the best players not to play Test cricket, Connor took 614 first-class wickets for Hampshire at an average of 31.74[17] and 411 wickets at 25.07 in one-day cricket.[18]  In 1985 Hampshire finished second in the County Championship, finishing 18 points behind winners Middlesex. Chris Smith led the way with the bat, scoring 1,720 runs.[19] and was well backed up by the bowling of Malcolm Marshall who took 95 wickets at the impressive average of 17.68.[20]  Later in, 1988 the club won the Benson & Hedges Cup by beating Derbyshire by 7 wickets at Lord's, largely thanks to a five wicket haul by Stephen Jefferies. The 1990s brought about further success in the first half of the decade, and later struggles in the latter half. In the 1991 County Championship season Hampshire won the NatWest Trophy, defeating Surrey by 4 wickets, with Shaun Udal claiming the man of the match award. This was the clubs first one day honour in this competition. Hampshire again repeated their 1988 success in the Benson & Hedges Cup by winning the 1992 competition. In the final at Lord's they beat Kent by 41 runs, including 90 runs from Robin Smith and three wickets each from Malcolm Marshall and Shaun Udal.  This marked Hampshire's second success in the competition. In 1996 Malcolm Marshall returned to coach the club. In 1997 work begun on Hampshire's long-awaited new ground. The realisation of this move almost led the club to financial ruin, as encouragement from financial partners Sport England and the hiring of architect Sir Michael Hopkins had led the then part-time voluntary committee running the club to lose control of the budget.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000 Australian great Shane Warne was signed as the club's overseas player. The 2000 County Championship was to be the last season that Hampshire would play at the County Ground Southampton before they moved in 2001 to the new Rose Bowl ground just outside Southampton. 2001 also saw current club chairman take over the running of the club, after a period of financial difficulty.[22] In the 2002 County Championship Hampshire were relegated back to Division Two, finishing third bottom in Division One.[23] It was during this season that the club signed former England batsman John Crawley from Lancashire. In the 2003 season Hampshire and England great Robin Smith retired from all forms of cricket after 23 years with the club.[24]  In 2005, Hampshire performed well in both first-class and one-day forms of the game. The side narrowly missed out on winning the County Championship Division 1 by just 2.5 points to Nottinghamshire.[25] In the 2005 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy Hampshire progressed to the final thanks to a century in the semi-final against Yorkshire by Sean Ervine.[26] In the final at Lord's against Warwickshire Ervine repeated the feat scoring 104 runs as Hampshire won by 18 runs;[27] Hampshire's first silverware in 13 years. Two years later, Hampshire progressed to the final of the newly renamed 2007 Friends Provident Trophy at Lord's after finishing top of the South Division.[28] In the final the club played Durham where they lost by 125 runs as the match went into a reserve day due to rain.[29] In 2007 Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove announced plans for the redevelopment of the Rose Bowl to bring Test cricket to the ground.[30] Prior to the 2008 County Championship season Australian legend and club captain Shane Warne reiterated his commitment to the club. But shortly before the start of the season Warne announced his retirement from first-class cricket.[31] \\r\\n Former captain Shaun Udal also announced his retirement, having played for Hampshire since 1989,[32] though he later joined Middlesex. Dimitri Mascarenhas was named Warne's replacement as captain for the 2008 season.[33] In 2008, Hampshire struggled and were near the foot of the Division 1 table for the majority of the season. Midway through the season coach Paul Terry stood down and was replaced by Giles White.  A series of strong performances helped Hampshire go from relegation favourites to title outsiders going into the final round of matches. The club ended up finishing in third place, twelve points behind winners Durham.[34]  On 25 July the club won the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy final at Lord's, beating rivals Sussex[35] thanks to a man-of-the-match performance from Dominic Cork, with him taking 4/41.  Hampshire created history by winning the 2010 Friends Provident t20 in front of home support after defeating Somerset ÿ the first team to win a Twenty20 trophy on home turf in England and Wales. On 14 September 2011, in their four-day game against Warwickshire at The Rose Bowl, Hampshire were officially relegated to the County Championship Second Division. The 2012 season though, under new captain Jimmy Adams after the retirement of Cork, would prove to be highly successful for Hampshire with the county winning both the 2012 Friends Life t20[36] ÿ their 2nd Twenty20 title, and the 2012 Clydesdale Bank 40 where a final ball dot ball from Kabir Ali led to Hampshire winning as a result of losing less wickets than opponents Warwickshire.[37] Club legend Dimitri Mascarenhas played in both finals but retired at the end of the 2013 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, despite constant success in limited overs cricket the county continued to struggle in First class cricket leading to coach Giles White moving into a Director of Cricket position and Dale Benkenstein being appointed the new coach at the beginning of 2014. He brought instant success as Hampshire won promotion as champions to the County Championship First Division with victory over Glamorgan on 23 September 2014. The 2015 season was reasonable successful with Hampshire qualifying for a record 6th successive Twenty20 Finals Day, however their First class performances at the beginning of the season were poor leading to Adams' resignation as captain. James Vince took over as captain, having already become List A and T20 captain previously, and led a revival as Hampshire won four of their last five games, meaning that Hampshire completed the 'Great Escape' as victory over Nottinghamshire in their final games thanks to 10 wickets from West Indian Fidel Edwards, and Yorkshire's victory over Sussex meant that Sussex and Worcestershire were relegated to Division Two with Hampshire staying up.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the winter of 2015 Hampshire completed the signing of England seamer Reece Topley from Essex. The club also announced that Fidel Edwards had signed a new deal and South African all rounder Ryan McLaren had signed as an overseas player. On 14 January 2016, Hampshire Cricket was announced as one of six new teams in the inaugural Women's Cricket Super League. Hampshire, in partnership with Berkshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Wiltshire cricket boards along with Southampton Solent University, will compete in a women's Twenty20 competition against the other team.[38] On 28 January 2016 Hampshire appointed former Wiltshire coach Nick Denning as their inaugural coach for their Women's team. Following the appointment of Denning, Hampshire announced the naming of their Women's Cricket Super League team as the Southern Vipers. The Vipers then won the inaugural Kia Super League on 21 August, defeating Western Force in the final by 7 wickets. Overseas star Suzie Bates was named as player of the tournament. For the male team though it was a season of disappointment. A large number of injuries at the start of the season, including to fast bowlers Reece Topley, Fidel Edwards, Chris Wood and Ryan Stevenson, coupled with poor form and tough circumstances, after the death of trialist fast bowler Hamza Ali in a drowning accident, and long serving opening batsman Michael Carberry being diagnosed with a cancerous lung tumour, saw Hampshire suffer a poor season, being knocked out in the group stages of both the Natwest t20 Blast, where they missed out on Finals Day for the first time since 2009, and the Royal London One-Day Cup. Their championship season was much the same as in 2015, again making a slow start, but they gave themselves too much to do and were relegated back to Division Two after defeat against Durham on 23 September 2016. However, on 3 October 2016 Hampshire were given a reprieve as Durham were relegated to Division Two after taking up a financial package from the ECB to help with their finances, with their relegation and a points deduction being the fine for taking this agreement.[39] Coach Dale Benkenstein departed as coach for 'Personal Reasons' in mid-July and was replaced by Craig White originally in a caretaker role, before taking over as full-time first team coach in November. At the end of the season, long serving seamer James Tomlinson retired having been with Hampshire since 2002 and making over 150 appearances in all formats for Hampshire. The Winter of 2017 saw Hampshire draw criticism over the signings of Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw on Kolpak deals, with these players giving up international cricket to represent Hampshire.[40] On the field Hampshire again had a mixed season in first class cricket, avoiding relegation for the 3rd season in a row by drawing against already relegated Warwickshire meaning relegation for Middlesex, with Kolpak Abbott taking 60 wickets across the First-class season. In List A cricket Hampshire again missed out on the knockout stages. However Hampshire performed better in Twenty20 cricket, qualifying for their 7th Finals Day in 8 years, although they lost in the Semi-final to eventual winners Nottinghamshire. They also recorded their highest Twenty20 score in their Quarter final victory over Derbyshire scoring 249-8, with Pakistan overseas player Shahid Afridi scoring a century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more details on this topic, see List of Hampshire CCC first-class cricket records, List of Hampshire CCC List A cricket records, List of Hampshire CCC Twenty20 cricket records.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more details on this topic, see Hampshire County Cricket Club record by opponent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHampshire play the majority of their home matches at The Rose Bowl. One reason for building the new Rose Bowl ground was to attract international cricket to the south coast of England. The old County Ground, Hampshire's home since 1885, no longer had the capability to do this. Land in West End, on the outskirts of Southampton was chosen as the location for The Rose Bowl. Construction began in March 1997 and was completed in time for the 2001 season.  Hampshire's first first-class match on the ground was against Worcestershire, ending in a victory by 124 runs for Hampshire.[42]  In July 2008 the ground hosted the Twenty20 Cup final, with Middlesex defeating Kent by 3 runs in the final.  In August 2010, the ground hosted the Friends Provident t20 finals day, in which history was created when Hampshire became the first team to win the tournament at their home ground as they defeated Somerset in dramatic scenes off the last ball of the match.[43]  In 2011, England played their first Test cricket|Test match at the Rose Bowl during their series with Sri Lanka.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ends are called the Pavilion End and the Northern End.","input":"How many time have hampshire won the county championship?"},{"output":"G.

Performing as members of The Jackson 5 and as solo artists, the children of Joseph Walter and Katherine Esther Jackson were very successful in the field of popular music from the late 1960s onwards. As a group, the eldest sons Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, Randy and Michael, made the family's reputation, facilitating the subsequent success of siblings Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet. The Jackson 5 became known as the \\"First Family of Soul\\"[1][2] (a title first held by the Five Stairsteps).[2] The continued success of Michael and Janet's careers as solo artists led the Jacksons to become known as the \\"Royal Family of Pop\\".[3] All nine of the Jackson siblings have gold records to their credits with La Toya holding the distinction of being the first Jackson sister to attain one (awarded by France's SNEP for \\"Reggae Night\\", a song she co-wrote for Jimmy Cliff).[4]\\r\\nIn recent years, certain members of the family have been honored for their work; in 1997 The Jackson 5 was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[5] Michael would follow the group to the hall in 2001. The Jacksons, Michael and Janet all received stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1980, 1984 and 1990 respectively. In 2009 a new series from A&E entitled The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty premiered documenting the Jackson brothers dealing with the sudden loss of Michael and preparing for a Jackson 5 Reunion tour.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJoseph Walter Jackson was born on July 26, 1928 in Arkansas but he grew up in Oakland, California with his father Samuel Jackson, a school teacher. At age 18 he moved to East Chicago, Indiana to be with his mother Crystal Lee King and to pursue his dreams of becoming a professional boxer. At age 21, Joseph married Katherine Scruse, 19, immediately starting a family. Even though he wanted to be a success in boxing it wasnt a job for a family man, so he obtained a job as an overhead crane operator with East Chicago's Inland Steel Company. His family continued to grow steadily and over the course of sixteen years he and Katherine had a house full of nine children. Joe Jackson always wanted to make it big and although he couldnt in boxing or in his own short musical stint in the 1950s with the band The Falcons, he saw the talent in his children, starting with Tito and Tito's ability to play the guitar.[7]\\r\\nSoon enough Joe Jackson formed a band of his sons Tito, Jermaine, and Jackie called The Jackson Brothers in 1964 and became their manager. After several years of doing local talent shows, Joseph enlarged the band to include Marlon and Michael, two of his younger sons, and then changed the name of the band to The Jackson Five by 1966, remaining the group's manager. As their father he was a very strict disciplinarian and had an abusive nature[citation needed] and as their manager he enforced long practice sessions of singing and dancing in hopes of preparing them to make it big one day. In August 1967, the group made a debut at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York where they won the Amateur Night contest. Gordon Keith the owner and producer at Steeltown Records in Gary, Indiana, discovered the Jackson Five and signed them to their first contract in November 1967. Big Boy, the boys' first record which was produced by Keith, was released on January 30, 1968. It became a local hit. In March 1969, they signed a Motown record contract and became known as the Jackson 5. The group enjoyed the fame Joseph Jackson had been longing for in his life. He continued to manage The Jackson 5 into stardom and after the band they had many No. 1 hits on the Billboard hot singles charts; Joseph moved them to a mansion in Encino, California with his own hefty salary he had obtained as their full-time manager. After many years as a band and with Michael as lead singer, the group continued to churn out even more hits and wealth, but tensions grew and in 1979, Michael severed ties with his father/manager and went on to pursue a solo musical entertainment career. Four years later, in 1983, Michael's siblings fired Joseph Jackson as their manager. In 1993, Michael Jackson accused his father of physical and mental abuse; a few of the other siblings confirmed this claim, but others denied it.[7]\\r\\nKatherine Jackson (ne Kattie B. Scruse) was born on May 4, 1930 in Barbour County, Alabama, the child of Prince Albert Scruse (1907ÿ1997) and Martha Mattie Upshaw (1907ÿ1990). She was left with a permanent limp after acquiring polio syndrome in her childhood. She later recovered from her illness after moving with her family to East Chicago, Indiana, where she would remain until meeting her husband Joseph Jackson. The couple moved and bought a small home in Gary, Indiana, where they birthed and raised nine children and she was a stay-at-home mother.[8] Throughout her life, Katherine remained a devoted Jehovah's Witness and raised her children strictly under the same spiritual teachings she received. Also, as a talented pianist and vocalist who shared her talents with her children, she was later credited for being the foundation of her children's success. After her sons' rise to fame as The Jackson 5, she strongly supported her children and became the costume designer for their shows and performances. Some of the memorable moments of her unconditional support were seen when her son Michael was tried for molestation charges in 1993 and 2005. Katherine now lives in Calabasas, California where she cares for the children of her late son, Michael.[8]\\r\\nTogether, Joseph and Katherine Jackson had ten children. Their son Brandon (Marlon's twin) died at birth. The other nine grew up to become professional musicians.[9]\\r\\nThere are 26 children that make up the third generation of the Jackson family along with several great-grandchildren. Among them, some have followed in the family's footsteps into the entertainment industry. Perhaps the most well known of the third generation are the three children of Michael Jackson. Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. (b. February 13, 1997), also known as \\"Prince\\", Paris Jackson (b. April 3, 1998), and Prince Michael Jackson II also known as \\"Blanket\\" now called \\"Bigi\\" (b. February 21, 2002), have been discussed in the press numerous times throughout their lives, particularly since their father's death in 2009. Austin Brown (b. 1985), the only son of Rebbie Jackson, is a singer and songwriter who has released several successful singles in the pop/R&B genre. Tito Jackson's three sons, Toriano Adaryll \\"Taj\\" Jackson, Jr. (b. 1973), Taryll Adren Jackson (b. 1975), and Tito Joe \\"TJ\\" Jackson (b.1978) make up the R&B/pop music group 3T. 3T has released three studio albums and has gone on to have moderate success in the industry, primarily outside of the United States. Sigmund \\"Siggy\\" Jackson Jr. (b. 1977), the eldest son to Jackie Jackson, is a hip-hop artist who goes under the name \\"Dealz\\". Siggy has been a ghostwriter for a number of independent artists and has obtained mild success as a solo artist. Jermaine La Jaune \\"Jay\\" Jackson Jr. (b. 1977), the eldest son to Jermaine Jackson, portrayed his father in the 1992 miniseries, The Jacksons: An American Dream, a biopic about the Jackson family. On January 3, 2017, at the age of 50, Janet gave birth to Eissa Al Mana, the newest member to the Jackson Family. Brandi. Jackson daughter to Jackie Jackson.

Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969) was a decision by the United States Supreme Court that defined the constitutional rights of students in U.S. public schools. The Tinker test is still used by courts today to determine whether a school's disciplinary actions violate students' First Amendment rights.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, Des Moines, Iowa residents John F. Tinker (15 years old), his siblings Mary Beth Tinker (13 years old), Hope Tinker (11 years old), and Paul Tinker (8 years old), along with their friend Christopher Eckhardt (16 years old) decided to wear black armbands to their schools (high school for John and Christopher, junior high for Mary Beth, elementary school for Hope and Paul) in protest of the Vietnam War and supporting the Christmas Truce called for by Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The principals of the Des Moines schools learned of the plan and met on December 14 to create a policy that stated that school children wearing an armband would be asked to remove it immediately. Students violating the policy would be suspended and allowed to return to school after agreeing to comply with it. The participants decided to violate this policy. Mary Beth Tinker and Christopher Eckhardt were suspended from school for wearing the armbands on December 16 and John Tinker was suspended for doing the same on the following day. (The two youngest participants were not punished.) Mary Beth, Christopher, and John were suspended from school until after January 1, 1966, when their protest had been scheduled to end.\\r\\nA suit was filed after the Iowa Civil Liberties Union approached the Tinker family and the ACLU agreed to help with the lawsuit. The children's fathers filed suit in U.S. District Court, which upheld the decision of the Des Moines school board. A tie vote in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit meant that the U.S. District Court's decision continued to stand, and forced the Tinkers and Eckhardts to appeal to the Supreme Court directly. The case was argued before the court on November 12, 1968.\\r\\nThe case was funded by Des Moines residents Louise Noun, then the president of the Iowa Civil Liberties Union, and her brother, Joseph Rosenfield, a businessman.[1][2]\\r\\nPrevious decisions, such as West Virginia State Board of Education v.

This case was the first time that the court set forth standards for safeguarding public school students' free speech rights.[3] This case involved symbolic speech, which was first recognized in Stromberg v. California.[3]\\r\\nThe court's 7ÿ2 decision held that the First Amendment applied to public schools, and that administrators would have to demonstrate constitutionally valid reasons for any specific regulation of speech in the classroom. The court observed, \\"It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\\"[4] Justice Abe Fortas wrote the majority opinion, holding that the speech regulation at issue in Tinker was \\"based upon an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression, even by the silent symbol of armbands, of opposition to this Nation's part in the conflagration in Vietnam.\\" The Court held that for school officials to justify censoring speech, they \\"must be able to show that [their] action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint,\\" that the conduct that would \\"materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.\\"[5] The Court found that the actions of the Tinkers in wearing armbands did not cause disruption and held that their activity represented constitutionally protected symbolic speech.\\r\\nJustices Hugo Black and John M.

Black, who had long believed that disruptive \\"symbolic speech\\" was not constitutionally protected, wrote, \\"While I have always believed that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments neither the State nor the Federal Government has any authority to regulate or censor the content of speech, I have never believed that any person has a right to give speeches or engage in demonstrations where he pleases and when he pleases.\\" Black argued that the Tinkers' behavior was indeed disruptive and declared, \\"I repeat that if the time has come when pupils of state-supported schools, kindergartens, grammar schools, or high schools, can defy and flout orders of school officials to keep their minds on their own schoolwork, it is the beginning of a new revolutionary era of permissiveness in this country fostered by the judiciary.\\"[6]\\r\\nHarlan dissented on the grounds that he \\"[found] nothing in this record which impugns the good faith of respondents in promulgating the armband regulation.\\"[7]\\r\\nTinker remains a viable and frequently cited Court precedent, though subsequent Court decisions have determined limitations on the scope of student free speech rights. In Bethel School District v. Fraser, a 1986 case, the Supreme Court held that a high school student's sexual innuendoÿladen speech during a student assembly was not constitutionally protected. Though Fraser applies the Tinker test of disruption to school decorum, if not undermining of educational mission, the effect is to make an exception to Tinker for \\"indecent\\" speech. Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier, where the court ruled that schools have the right to regulate, for legitimate educational reasons, the content of non-forum, school-sponsored newspapers, also limits Tinker's application. The Court in Hazelwood clarified that both Fraser and Hazelwood were decided under the doctrine of Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators Association. Such a distinction keeps undisturbed the Material Disruption doctrine of Tinker, while deciding certain student free speech cases under the Nonpublic Forum doctrine of Perry. In Morse v. Frederick, the so-called \\"Bong Hits For Jesus\\" case of 2007, the Court held that schools may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict student speech at a school-sponsored event, even those events occurring off school grounds, when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use. In 2013, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit re-heard a case en banc that had been argued before a panel of three of its judges, considering whether middle school students involved in a charitable efforta breast cancer awareness drivecould be prohibited from wearing bracelets imprinted with \\"I ? Boobies! (Keep a Breast)\\".[8][9] The Third Circuit cited Tinker when ruling that the school's ban on the bracelets violated the students' right to free speech because the bracelets were not plainly offensive or disruptive and were speech conducted to raise awareness of a social issue.[10][11] The Supreme Court later declined to take up the case.[9]\\r\\nSeveral cases have arisen from the modern display of the Confederate flag. Courts applying the \\"disruption\\" test under Tinker have held that schools may prohibit students from wearing clothing with Confederate symbols.[12]","input":"What did the court rule in tinker v. des moines?"},{"output":"Union of South Africa","context":"","input":"What is the original name of south africa?"},{"output":"Ramavriksha Benipuri","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJayaprakash Narayan (?listen?(help{info); 11 October 1902?ÿ 8 October 1979), popularly referred to as JP or Lok Nayak (Hindi for The People's Leader), was an Indian independence activist, theorist, communist and political leader, remembered especially for leading the mid-1970s opposition against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, for whose overthrow he called a \\"total revolution\\". His biography, Jayaprakash, was written by his nationalist friend and an eminent writer of Hindi literature, Ramavriksha Benipuri. In 1999, he was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, in recognition of his social work. Other awards include the Magsaysay award for Public Service in 1965.\\r\\n\\r\\nJayprakash Narayan was born on 11 October 1902[1] in the village of Sitabdiara (It was in Saran district of Bihar when JP was born. At present it is in Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh, India).[2] Sitabdiara is a large village, straddling two states and three districtsChhapra and Arrah in Bihar and Ballia in Uttar Pradesh.[3] His house was near the banks of the flood-prone Ghagra river in Lala Tola, Bihar. Every time the river swelled, the house would get a little bit damaged, eventually forcing the family to move a few kilometres away to a settlement which is now known as Jay Prakash Nagar and falls in Uttar Pradesh. He came from a kayastha family.[4] He was the fourth child of Harsu Dayal and Phul Rani Devi. His father Harsu Dayal was a junior official in the Canal Department of the State government and was often touring the region. When Narayan was 9 years old, he left his village to enroll in 7th class of the collegiate school at Patna.[5] This was his first break from village life. JP stayed at a student hostelSaraswati Bhawanin which most of the boys were a bit older. Among them were some of Bihar's future leaders including its first chief minister, Krishna Singh, his deputy Anugrah Narayan Sinha and several others who were to widely become known in politics and academic world.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1920, 18 year old Narayan got married to Braj Kishore Prasad's 14 year old daughter Prabhavati Devi, a freedom fighter in her own right.[8], their ages being normal marriageable ages at those times. After their wedding, since Narayan was working in Patna and it was difficult for his wife to stay with him, on the invitation of Gandhi, Prabhavati became an inmate at Sabarmati Ashram (Ahmedabad).[9] Jayaprakash, along with some friends, went to listen to Maulana Abul Kalam Azad speak about the Non-co-operation movement launched by Gandhi against the passing of the Rowlatt Act of 1919. The Maulana was a brilliant orator and his call to give up English education was \\"like leaves before a storm: Jayaprakash was swept away and momentarily lifted up to the skies. That brief experience of soaring up with the winds of a great idea left imprints on his inner being\\". Jayaprakash took the Maulana's words to heart and left Patna College with just 20 days remaining for his examinations. Jayaprakash joined the Bihar Vidyapeeth, a college founded by Dr. Rajendra Prasad and became among the first students of Gandhian Dr. Anugraha Narayan Sinha.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter exhausting the courses at the Vidyapeeth, Jayaprakash decided to continue studies in the United States.[8]\\r\\nAt age 20, Jayaprakash sailed aboard the cargo ship Janus while Prabhavati remained at Sabarmati. Jayaprakash reached California on 8 October 1922 and was admitted to Berkeley in January 1923.[10] To pay for his education, Jayaprakash picked grapes, set them out to dry, packed fruits at a canning factory, washed dishes, worked as a mechanic at a garage and at a slaughter house, sold lotions and taught.[citation needed] All these jobs gave Jayaprakash an insight into the difficulties of the working class. After a semester studying chemistry[11] at UC Berkeley, Jayaprakash was forced to transfer to The University of Iowa when fees at Berkeley were doubled. He was forced to transfer to many universities thereafter. He pursued his favourite subject, sociology, and received much help from Professor Edward Ross.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Wisconsin, Jayaprakash was introduced to Karl Marx's Das Kapital. News of the success of the Russian revolution of 1917 made Jayaprakash conclude that Marxism was the way to alleviate the suffering of the masses. He delved into books by Indian intellectual and Communist theoretician M. N. Roy. His paper on sociology, \\"Social Variation\\", was declared the best of the year.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNarayan returned from the US to India in late 1929 as a Marxist.[12] He joined the Indian National Congress on the invitation of Jawaharlal Nehru in 1929; Mahatma Gandhi became his mentor in the Congress. He shared a house at Kadam Kuan in Patna with his close friend and nationalist Ganga Sharan Singh (Sinha).[13] with whom he shared the most cordial and lasting friendship.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe won particular fame during the Quit India movement.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being jailed in 1932 for civil disobedience against British rule, Narayan was imprisoned in Nasik Jail, where he met Ram Manohar Lohia, Minoo Masani, Achyut Patwardhan, Ashok Mehta, Basawon Singh (Sinha), Yusuf Desai, C K Narayanaswami and other national leaders. After his release, the Congress Socialist Party, or (CSP), a left-wing group within the Congress, was formed with Acharya Narendra Deva as President and Narayan as General secretary.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mahatma Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement in August 1942, Yogendra Shukla scaled the wall of Hazaribagh Central Jail along with Jayaprakash Narayan, Suraj Narayan Singh, Gulab Chand Gupta, Pandit Ramnandan Mishra, Shaligram Singh and Shyam Barthwar, with a goal to start an underground movement for freedom.[14] Many young socialist leaders like Dr Ram Manohar Lohia, Chhotubhai Puranik, Aruna Asaf Ali, etc. took part in underground movement. As Jayaprakash Narayan was ill, Yogendra Shukla walked to Gaya with Jayaprakash Narayan on his shoulders,[14] a distance of about 124 kilometres.[15] He also served as the[16] Chairman of Anugrah Smarak Nidhi (Anugrah Narayan Memorial Fund).\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1953, Jayaprakash Narayan was President of All India Railwaymen's Federation, the largest labour union in the Indian Railways.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nNarayan returned to prominence in State politics in the late 1960s. 1974 ushered in a year of high inflation, unemployment and lack of supplies and essential commodities. Nav Nirman Andolan movement of Gujarat asked Jayaprakash to lead a peaceful agitation. Following Jayaprakash Narayan's call for social justice, and a demand for dissolution of the Bihar assembly. The Bihar government used brutal force to suppress the movement and on 18 March 1974, police fired on unarmed demonstrators and eight people were killed in police firing. On 8 April 1974, aged 72, he led a silent procession at Patna. The procession was lathi charged. On 5 June 1974, Jayaprakash addressed a large crowd at Gandhi Maidan in Patna. He declared, \\"This is a revolution, friends! We are not here merely to see the Vidhan Sabha dissolved. That is only one milestone on our journey. But we have a long way to go... After 27 years of freedom, people of this country are wracked by hunger, rising prices, corruption... oppressed by every kind of injustice... it is a Total Revolution we want, nothing less!\\" In 1974, he led the students' movement in the state of Bihar which gradually developed into a popular people's movement known as the Bihar Movement. It was during this movement that JP gave a call for peaceful Total Revolution.  Together with V. M. Tarkunde, he found the Citizens for Democracy in 1974 and the People's Union for Civil Liberties in 1976, both NGOs, to uphold and defend civil liberties.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndira was found guilty of violating electoral laws by the Allahabad High Court. Narayan called for Indira and the CMs to resign and the military and police to disregard unconstitutional and immoral orders. He advocated a program of social transformation which he termed Sampoorna kraanti, \\"total revolution\\". Immediately afterwords, Gandhi proclaimed a national Emergency on the midnight of 25 June 1975. Desai, opposition leaders, and dissenting members of his own party were arrested that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nJayaprakash Narayan attracted a gathering of 100,000 people at the Ramlila grounds and thunderously recited Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar''s wonderfully evocative poetry: Singhasan Khaali Karo Ke Janata Aaati Hai.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nNarayan was kept as detenu at Chandigarh even after he asked for one month parole to mobilise relief in flooded parts of Bihar. His health suddenly deteriorated on 24 October, and he was released on 12 November; diagnosis at Jaslok Hospital, Bombay, revealed kidney failure; he would be on dialysis for the rest of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, Surur Hoda launched the \\"Free JP\\" campaign chaired by Nobel Peace Prize winner Noel-Baker for the release of Jayaprakash Narayan.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndira Gandhi revoked the emergency on 18 January 1977 and announced elections. The Janata Party, a vehicle for the broad spectrum of the opposition to Indira Gandhi, was formed under JP's guidance.[citation needed] The Janata Party was voted into power and became the first non-Congress party to form a government at the Centre.[citation needed] On the call of Narayan, many youngsters joined the JP movement.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNarayan died in Patna, Bihar,[20] on 8 October 1979, three days before his 77th birthday, due to effects of diabetes and heart ailments. In March 1979, while he was in hospital, his death had been erroneously announced by the Indian prime minister, Morarji Desai, causing a grief wave of national mourning, including the suspension of parliament and regular radio broadcasting, and the closure of schools and shops. When he was told about the gaffe a few weeks later, he smiled.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of 18, Jayaprakash was married to Prabhavati Devi, daughter of lawyer and nationalist Brij Kishore Prasad in October 1920. Prabhavati was very independent and on Gandhi's invitation, went to stay at his ashram while Jayaprakash continued his studies.[21] Prabhavati Devi died in 1973 after a long battle with cancer.","input":"Who wrote the biography of lok nayak jaiprakash narayan?"},{"output":"at One Lincoln Circle at Reservoir Park in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Civil War Museum, located at One Lincoln Circle at Reservoir Park in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, is a permanent, nonprofit educational institution created to promote the preservation of material culture and sources of information that are directly relevant to the American Civil War of 1861ÿ1865, and the aftermath period of the war as related to Civil War Veterans' service organizations, including the Grand Army of the Republic, United Confederate Veterans and the Daughters of the Confederacy to 1920.

Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Like much of African-inspired music, funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves. Funk uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.\\r\\n\\r\\nFunk originated in the mid-1960s, with James Brown's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeatwith heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure (\\"The One\\"), and the application of swung 16th notes  and syncopation on all bass lines, drum patterns, and guitar riffs.[2] Other musical groups, including Sly and the Family Stone, the Meters, and Parliament-Funkadelic, soon began to adopt and develop Brown's innovations. While much of the written history of funk focuses on men, there have been notable funk women, including Chaka Khan, Labelle, Lyn Collins, Brides of Funkenstein, Klymaxx, Mother's Finest, and Betty Davis.\\r\\n\\r\\nFunk derivatives include the psychedelic funk eras of Sly Stone and George Clinton; the avant-funk of white groups such as Talking Heads and the Pop Group; boogie, a form of post-disco dance music; electro music, a hybrid of electronic music and funk; funk metal (e.g., Living Colour, Faith No More); G-funk, a mix of gangsta rap and funk; Timba, a form of funky Cuban popular dance music; and funk jam (e.g., Phish). Funk samples and breakbeats have been used extensively in hip hop and various forms of electronic dance music, such as house music, old-school rave, breakbeat, and drum and bass. It is also the main influence of go-go, a subgenre associated with funk.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word funk initially referred (and still refers) to a strong odor. It is originally derived from Latin \\"fumigare\\" (which means \\"to smoke\\") via Old French \\"fungiere\\" and, in this sense, it was first documented in English in 1620. In 1784 \\"funky\\" meaning \\"musty\\" was first documented, which, in turn, led to a sense of \\"earthy\\" that was taken up around 1900 in early jazz slang for something \\"deeply or strongly felt\\".[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early jam sessions, musicians would encourage one another to \\"get down\\" by telling one another, \\"Now, put some stank on it!\\". At least as early as 1907, jazz songs carried titles such as Funky. The first example is an unrecorded number by Buddy Bolden, remembered as either \\"Funky Butt\\" or \\"Buddy Bolden's Blues\\" with improvised lyrics that were, according to Donald M. Marquis, either \\"comical and light\\" or \\"crude and downright obscene\\" but, in one way or another, referring to the sweaty atmosphere at dances where Bolden's band played.[7][8] As late as the 1950s and early 1960s, when \\"funk\\" and \\"funky\\" were used increasingly in the context of jazz music, the terms still were considered indelicate and inappropriate for use in polite company. According to one source, New Orleans-born drummer Earl Palmer \\"was the first to use the word 'funky' to explain to other musicians that their music should be made more syncopated and danceable.\\"[9] The style later evolved into a rather hard-driving, insistent rhythm, implying a more carnal quality. This early form of the music set the pattern for later musicians.[10] The music was identified as slow, sexy, loose, riff-oriented and danceable.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA great deal of funk is rhythmically based on a two-celled onbeat/offbeat structure, which originated in sub-Saharan African music traditions. New Orleans appropriated the bifurcated structure from the Afro-Cuban mambo and conga in the late 1940s, and made it its own.[11] New Orleans funk, as it was called, gained international acclaim largely because James Brown's rhythm section used it to great effect.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunk creates an intense groove by using strong guitar riffs and bass lines. Like Motown recordings, funk songs used bass lines as the centerpiece of songs. Slap bass's mixture of thumb-slapped low notes and finger \\"popped\\" (or plucked) high notes allowed the bass to have a drum-like rhythmic role, which became a distinctive element of funk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn funk bands, guitarists typically play in a percussive style, often using the wah-wah sound effect and muting the notes in their riffs to create a percussive sound. Guitarist Ernie Isley of the Isley Brothers and Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic were notably influenced by Jimi Hendrix's improvised solos. Eddie Hazel, who worked with George Clinton, is one of the most notable guitar soloists in funk. Ernie Isley was tutored at an early age by Jimi Hendrix himself, when he was a part of the Isley Brothers backing band and temporarily lived in the attic at the Isleys' household. Jimmy Nolen and Phelps Collins are famous funk rhythm guitarists who both worked with James Brown. On Brown's \\"Give It Up or Turnit a Loose\\" (1969), Jimmy Nolen's guitar part has a bare bones tonal structure. The pattern of attack-points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches. The guitar is used the way that an African drum, or idiophone would be used. Note that the measures alternate between beginning on the beat, and beginning on offbeats.\\r\\n\\r\\nFunk uses the same richly coloured extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. However, unlike bebop jazz, with its complex, rapid-fire chord changes, funk virtually abandoned chord changes, creating static single chord vamps with melodo-harmonic movement and a complex, driving rhythmic feel. Some of the best known and most skilful soloists in funk have jazz backgrounds. Trombonist Fred Wesley and saxophonist Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker are among the most notable musicians in the funk music genre, with both of them working with James Brown, George Clinton and Prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chords used in funk songs typically imply a dorian or mixolydian mode, as opposed to the major or natural minor tonalities of most popular music. Melodic content was derived by mixing these modes with the blues scale. In the 1970s, jazz music drew upon funk to create a new subgenre of jazz-funk, which can be heard in recordings by Miles Davis (Live-Evil, On the Corner), and Herbie Hancock (Head Hunters).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe distinctive characteristics of African-American musical expression are rooted in sub-Saharan African music traditions, and find their earliest expression in spirituals, work chants/songs, praise shouts, gospel, blues, and \\"body rhythms\\" (hambone, patting juba, and ring shout clapping and stomping patterns). Funk music is an amalgam of soul music, soul jazz, R&B, and Afro-Cuban rhythms absorbed and reconstituted in New Orleans.  Like other styles of African-American musical expression including jazz, soul music and R&B, funk music accompanied many protest movements during and after the Civil Rights Movement. Funk allowed everyday experiences to be expressed to challenge daily struggles and hardships fought by lower and working class communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerhard Kubik notes that with the exception of New Orleans, early blues lacked complex polyrhythms, and there was a \\"very specific absence of asymmetric time-line patterns (key patterns) in virtually all early twentieth century African-American music?... only in some New Orleans genres does a hint of simple time line patterns occasionally appear in the form of transient so-called 'stomp' patterns or stop-time chorus. These do not function in the same way as African time lines.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1940s this changed somewhat when the two-celled time line structure was brought into New Orleans blues. New Orleans musicians were especially receptive to Afro-Cuban influences precisely at the time when R&B was first forming.[14] Dave Bartholomew and Professor Longhair (Henry Roeland Byrd) incorporated Afro-Cuban instruments, as well as the clave pattern and related two-celled figures in songs such as \\"Carnival Day\\" (Bartholomew 1949) and \\"Mardi Gras In New Orleans\\" (Longhair 1949). Robert Palmer reports that, in the 1940s, Professor Longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and \\"fell under the spell of Perez Prado's mambo records.\\"[11] Professor Longhair's particular style was known locally as rumba-boogie.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Longhair's great contributions was his particular approach of adopting two-celled, clave-based patterns into New Orleans rhythm and blues (R&B). Longhair's rhythmic approach became a basic template of funk. According to Dr. John (Malcolm John \\"Mac\\" Rebennack, Jr.), the Professor \\"put funk into music?... Longhair's thing had a direct bearing I'd say on a large portion of the funk music that evolved in New Orleans.\\"[16] In his \\"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\\", the pianist employs the 2-3 clave onbeat/offbeat motif in a rumba-boogie \\"guajeo\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to swung subdivisions) took root in New Orleans R&B during this time. Stewart states: \\"Eventually, musicians from outside of New Orleans began to learn some of the rhythmic practices [of the Crescent City]. Most important of these were James Brown and the drummers and arrangers he employed. Brown's early repertoire had used mostly shuffle rhythms, and some of his most successful songs were 12/8 ballads (e.g. 'Please, Please, Please' (1956), 'Bewildered' (1961), 'I Don't Mind' (1961)). Brown's change to a funkier brand of soul required 4/4 metre and a different style of drumming.\\"[18] Stewart makes the point: \\"The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Richard's saxophone-studded, mid-1950s R&B road band was credited by James Brown and others as being the first to put the funk in the rock'n'roll beat.[20] Following his temporary exit from secular music to become an evangelist in 1957, some of Little Richard's band members joined Brown and the Famous Flames, beginning a long string of hits for them in 1958. By the mid-1960s, James Brown had developed his signature groove that emphasized the downbeatwith heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure to etch his distinctive sound, rather than the backbeat that typified African-American music.[21] Brown often cued his band with the command \\"On the one!,\\" changing the percussion emphasis/accent from the one-two-three-four backbeat of traditional soul music to the one-two-three-four downbeat ÿ but with an even-note syncopated guitar rhythm (on quarter notes two and four) featuring a hard-driving, repetitive brassy swing. This one-three beat launched the shift in Brown's signature music style, starting with his 1964 hit single, \\"Out of Sight\\" and his 1965 hits, \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\\" and \\"I Got You (I Feel Good)\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown's style of funk was based on interlocking, contrapuntal parts: funky bass lines, drum patterns, and syncopated guitar riffs.[2] The main guitar ostinatos for \\"Ain't it Funky\\" (c. late 1960s) is an example of Brown's refinement of New Orleans funk an irresistibly danceable riff, stripped down to its rhythmic essence. On \\"Ain't it Funky\\" the tonal structure is barebones. Brown's innovations led to him and his band becoming the seminal funk act; they also pushed the funk music style further to the forefront with releases such as \\"Cold Sweat\\" (1967), \\"Mother Popcorn\\" (1969) and \\"Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine\\" (1970), discarding even the twelve-bar blues featured in his earlier music. Instead, Brown's music was overlaid with \\"catchy, anthemic vocals\\" based on \\"extensive vamps\\" in which he also used his voice as \\"a percussive instrument with frequent rhythmic grunts and with rhythm-section patterns?... [resembling] West African polyrhythms\\" ÿ a tradition evident in African-American work songs and chants.[22] Throughout his career, Brown's frenzied vocals, frequently punctuated with screams and grunts, channeled the \\"ecstatic ambiance of the black church\\" in a secular context.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1965, Brown's bandleader and arranger was Alfred \\"Pee Wee\\" Ellis. Ellis credits Clyde Stubblefield's adoption of New Orleans drumming techniques, as the basis of modern funk: \\"If, in a studio, you said 'play it funky' that could imply almost anything. But 'give me a New Orleans beat' ÿ you got exactly what you wanted. And Clyde Stubblefield was just the epitome of this funky drumming.\\"[23] Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from \\"New Orleansthrough James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s.\\"[19] Concerning the various funk motifs, Stewart states: \\"This model, it should be noted, is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 1990 interview, Brown offered his reason for switching the rhythm of his music: \\"I changed from the upbeat to the downbeat?... Simple as that, really.\\"[25] According to Maceo Parker, Brown's former saxophonist, playing on the downbeat was at first hard for him and took some getting used to. Reflecting back to his early days with Brown's band, Parker reported that he had difficulty playing \\"on the one\\" during solo performances, since he was used to hearing and playing with the accent on the second beat.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther musical groups picked up on the rhythms and vocal style developed by James Brown and his band, and the funk style began to grow. Dyke and the Blazers, based in Phoenix, Arizona, released \\"Funky Broadway\\" in 1967, perhaps the first record of the soul music era to have \\"funky\\" in the title. In 1969 Jimmy McGriff released Electric Funk, featuring his distinctive organ over a blazing horn section.  Meanwhile, on the West Coast, Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band was releasing funk tracks beginning with its first album in 1967, culminating in the classic single \\"Express Yourself\\" in 1971. Also from the West Coast area, more specifically Oakland, San Francisco, came the band Tower of Power (TOP), which formed in 1968. Their debut album East Bay Grease, released 1970, is considered an important milestone in funk. Throughout the 1970s, TOP had many hits, and the band helped to make funk music a successful genre, with a broader audience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970, Sly & the Family Stone's \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\" reached #1 on the charts, as did \\"Family Affair\\" in 1971.  Notably, these afforded the group and the genre crossover success and greater recognition, yet such success escaped comparatively talented and moderately popular funk band peers. The Meters defined funk in New Orleans, starting with their top ten R&B hits \\"Sophisticated Cissy\\" and \\"Cissy Strut\\" in 1969. Another group who defined funk around this time were the Isley Brothers, whose funky 1969 #1 R&B hit, \\"It's Your Thing\\", signaled a breakthrough in African-American music, bridging the gaps of the jazzy sounds of Brown, the psychedelic rock of Jimi Hendrix, and the upbeat soul of Sly & the Family Stone and Mother's Finest. The Temptations, who had previously helped to define the \\"Motown Sound\\" ÿ a distinct blend of pop-soul ÿ adopted this new psychedelic sound towards the end of the 1960s as well. Their producer, Norman Whitfield, became an innovator in the field of psychedelic soul, creating hits with a newer, funkier sound for many Motown acts, including \\"War\\" by Edwin Starr, \\"Smiling Faces Sometimes\\" by the Undisputed Truth and \\"Papa Was A Rollin' Stone\\" by the Temptations. Motown producers Frank Wilson (\\"Keep On Truckin'\\") and Hal Davis (\\"Dancing Machine\\") followed suit. Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye also adopted funk beats for some of their biggest hits in the 1970s, such as \\"Superstition\\" and \\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\\", and \\"I Want You\\" and \\"Got To Give It Up\\", respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new group of musicians began to further develop the \\"funk rock\\" approach.  Innovations were prominently made by George Clinton, with his bands Parliament and Funkadelic. Together, they produced a new kind of funk sound heavily influenced by jazz and psychedelic rock.  The two groups shared members and are often referred to collectively as \\"Parliament-Funkadelic.\\" The breakout popularity of Parliament-Funkadelic gave rise to the term \\"P-Funk\\", which referred to the music by George Clinton's bands, and defined a new subgenre. Clinton played a principal role in several other bands, including Parlet, the Horny Horns, and the Brides of Funkenstein, all part of the P-Funk conglomerate. \\"P-funk\\" also came to mean something in its quintessence, of superior quality, or sui generis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1970s were the era of highest mainstream visibility for funk music. In addition to Parliament Funkadelic, artists like Sly and the Family Stone, Rufus & Chaka Khan, the Isley Brothers, Ohio Players, Con Funk Shun, Kool and the Gang, the Bar-Kays, Commodores, Roy Ayers, Stevie Wonder, among others, were successful in getting radio play. Disco music owed a great deal to funk. Many early disco songs and performers came directly from funk-oriented backgrounds. Some disco music hits, such as all of Barry White's hits, \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" by Biddu and Carl Douglas, Donna Summer's \\"Love To Love You Baby\\", Diana Ross' \\"Love Hangover\\", KC and the Sunshine Band's \\"I'm Your Boogie Man\\", \\"I'm Every Woman\\" by Chaka Khan (also known as the Queen of Funk Soul), and Chic's \\"Le Freak\\" conspicuously include riffs and rhythms derived from funk.  In 1976, Rose Royce scored a number-one hit with a purely dance-funk record, \\"Car Wash\\". Even with the arrival of Disco, funk became increasingly popular well into the early '80s.\\r\\n\\r\\nFunk music was also exported to Africa, and it melded with African singing and rhythms to form Afrobeat. Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, who was heavily influenced by James Brown's music, is credited with creating the style and terming it \\"Afrobeat\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1970s, at the same time that jazz musicians began to explore blending jazz with rock to create jazz fusion, major jazz performers began to experiment with funk. Jazz-funk recordings typically used electric bass and electric piano in the rhythm section, in place of the double bass and acoustic piano that were typically used in jazz up till that point. Pianist and bandleader Herbie Hancock was the first of many big jazz artists who embraced funk during the decade. Hancock's Headhunters band (1973) played the jazz-funk style. The Headhunters' lineup and instrumentation, retaining only wind player Bennie Maupin from Hancock's previous sextet, reflected his new musical direction. He used percussionist Bill Summers in addition to a drummer. Summers blended African, Afro-Cuban, and Afro-Brazilian instruments and rhythms into Hancock's jazzy funk sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Corner (1972) was jazz trumpeter-composer Miles Davis's seminal foray into jazz-funk. Like his previous works though, On the Corner was experimental. Davis stated that On the Corner was an attempt at reconnecting with the young black audience which had largely forsaken jazz for rock and funk. While there is a discernible funk influence in the timbres of the instruments employed, other tonal and rhythmic textures, such as the Indian tambora and tablas, and Cuban congas and bongos, create a multi-layered soundscape. From a musical standpoint, the album was a culmination of sorts of the recording studio-based musique concrte approach that Davis and producer Teo Macero (who had studied with Otto Luening at Columbia University's Computer Music Center) had begun to explore in the late 1960s. Both sides of the record featured heavy funk drum and bass grooves, with the melodic parts snipped from hours of jams and mixed in the studio.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso cited as musical influences on the album by Davis were the contemporary composer Karlheinz Stockhausen.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, largely as a reaction against what was seen as the over-indulgence of disco, many of the core elements that formed the foundation of the P-Funk formula began to be usurped by electronic instruments, drum machines and synthesizers. Horn sections of saxophones and trumpets were replaced by synth keyboards, and the horns that remained were given simplified lines, and few horn solos were given to soloists. The classic electric keyboards of funk, like the Hammond B3 organ, the Hohner Clavinet and/or the Fender Rhodes piano began to be replaced by the new digital synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7. Electronic drum machines such as the Roland TR-808 began to replace the \\"funky drummers\\" of the past, and the slap and pop style of bass playing were often replaced by synth keyboard bass lines. Lyrics of funk songs began to change from suggestive double entendres to more graphic and sexually explicit content.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, the electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) began experimenting with electronic funk music, introducing \\"videogame-funk\\" sounds with hits such as \\"Computer Game\\" (1978), which had a strong influence on the later electro-funk genre.[29] In 1980, YMO was the first band to use the TR-808 programmable drum machine,[30] while YMO member Ryuichi Sakamoto's \\"Riot in Lagos\\" developed the beats and sounds of electro-funk that same year,[31] influencing later electro-funk artists such as Afrika Bambaataa[31] and Mantronix.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nRick James was the first funk musician of the 1980s to assume the funk mantle dominated by P-Funk in the 1970s. His 1981 album Street Songs, with the singles \\"Give It to Me Baby\\" and \\"Super Freak\\", resulted in James becoming a star, and paved the way for the future direction of explicitness in funk.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the late 1970s, Prince used a stripped-down, dynamic instrumentation similar to James. However, Prince went on to have as much of an impact on the sound of funk as any one artist since Brown; he combined eroticism, technology, an increasing musical complexity, and an outrageous image and stage show to ultimately create music as ambitious and imaginative as P-Funk. Prince formed the Time, originally conceived as an opening act for him and based on his \\"Minneapolis sound\\", hybrid mixture of funk, R&B, rock, pop & new wave.  Eventually, the band went on to define their own style of stripped-down funk based on tight musicianship and sexual themes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar to Prince, other bands emerged during the P-Funk era and began to incorporate uninhibited sexuality, dance-oriented themes, synthesizers and other electronic technologies to continue to craft funk hits. These included Cameo, Zapp, the Gap Band, the Bar-Kays, and the Dazz Band all found their biggest hits in the early 1980s. By the latter half of the 80s, pure funk had lost its commercial impact; however, pop artists from Michael Jackson to Duran Duran often used funk beats.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfluenced by Yellow Magic Orchestra[31] and Kraftwerk, the American musician Afrika Bambaataa developed electro-funk, a minimalist machine-driven style of funk with his single \\"Planet Rock\\" in 1982. Also known simply as electro, this style of funk was driven by synthesizers and the electronic rhythm of the TR-808 drum machine. The single \\"Renegades of Funk\\" followed in 1983.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile funk was all but driven from the radio by slick commercial hip hop, contemporary R&B and new jack swing, its influence continued to spread. Artists like Steve Arrington and Cameo still received major airplay and had huge global followings.  Rock bands began copying elements of funk to their sound, creating new combinations of \\"funk rock\\" and \\"funk metal\\". Extreme, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Living Colour, Jane's Addiction, Prince, Primus, Fishbone, Faith No More, Rage Against the Machine, Infectious Grooves, and Incubus spread the approach and styles garnered from funk pioneers to new audiences in the mid-to-late 1980s and the 1990s. These bands later inspired the underground mid-1990s funkcore movement and current funk-inspired artists like Outkast, Malina Moye, Van Hunt, and Gnarls Barkley.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, artists like Me'shell Ndegeocello and the (predominantly UK-based) acid jazz movement including artists and bands such as Jamiroquai, Incognito, Galliano, Omar, Los Tetas and the Brand New Heavies carried on with strong elements of funk. However, they never came close to reaching the commercial success of funk in its heyday, with the exception of Jamiroquai whose album Travelling Without Moving sold about 11.5 million units worldwide. Meanwhile, in Australia and New Zealand, bands playing the pub circuit, such as Supergroove, Skunkhour and the Truth, preserved a more instrumental form of funk.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the late 1980s hip hop artists have regularly sampled old funk tunes. James Brown is said to be the most sampled artist in the history of hip hop, while P-Funk is the second most sampled artist; samples of old Parliament and Funkadelic songs formed the basis of West Coast G-funk.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal beats that feature funk-styled bass or rhythm guitar riffs are also not uncommon. Dr. Dre (considered the progenitor of the G-funk genre) has freely acknowledged to being heavily influenced by George Clinton's psychedelic funk: \\"Back in the 70s that's all people were doing: getting high, wearing Afros, bell-bottoms and listening to Parliament-Funkadelic. That's why I called my album The Chronic and based my music and the concepts like I did: because his shit was a big influence on my music. Very big\\".[33] Digital Underground was a large contributor to the rebirth of funk in the 1990s by educating their listeners with knowledge about the history of funk and its artists. George Clinton branded Digital Underground as \\"Sons of the P\\", as their second full-length release is also titled. DU's first release, Sex Packets, was full of funk samples, with the most widely known \\"The Humpty Dance\\" sampling Parliament's \\"Let's Play House\\". A very strong funk album of DU's was their 1996 release Future Rhythm. Much of contemporary club dance music, drum and bass in particular has heavily sampled funk drum breaks.\\r\\n\\r\\nFunk is a major element of certain artists identified with the jam band scene of the late 1990s and 2000s. Phish began playing funkier jams in their sets around 1996, and 1998's The Story of the Ghost was heavily influenced by funk. Medeski Martin & Wood, Robert Randolph & the Family Band, Galactic, Widespread Panic, Jam Underground, Diazpora, Soulive, and Karl Denson's Tiny Universe all drawing heavily from the funk tradition. Lettuce, a band of Berklee College Of Music graduates, was formed in the late 1990s as a pure-funk emergence was being felt through the jam band scene.[citation needed] Many members of the band including keyboardist Neal Evans went on to other projects such as Soulive or the Sam Kininger Band. Dumpstaphunk builds upon the New Orleans tradition of funk, with their gritty, low-ended grooves and soulful four-part vocals. Formed in 2003 to perform at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, the band features keyboardist Ivan Neville and guitarist Ian Neville of the famous Neville family, with two bass players and female funk drummer Nikki Glaspie (formerly of Beyonc Knowles's world touring band, as well as the Sam Kininger Band), who joined the group in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the mid-1990s the nu-funk scene, centered on the Deep Funk collectors scene, is producing new material influenced by the sounds of rare funk 45s. Labels include Desco, Soul Fire, Daptone, Timmion, Neapolitan, Bananarama, Kay-Dee, and Tramp. These labels often release on 45?rpm records. Although specializing in music for rare funk DJs, there has been some crossover into the mainstream music industry, such as Sharon Jones' 2005 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 2000s, some punk funk bands such as Out Hud and Mongolian MonkFish perform in the indie rock scene. Indie band Rilo Kiley, in keeping with their tendency to explore a variety of rockish styles, incorporated funk into their song \\"The Moneymaker\\" on the album Under the Blacklight. Prince, with his later albums, gave a rebirth to the funk sound with songs like \\"The Everlasting Now\\", \\"Musicology\\", \\"Ol' Skool Company\\", and \\"Black Sweat\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFunk has also been incorporated into modern R&B music by many female singers such as Beyonc with her 2003 hit \\"Crazy in Love\\" (which samples the Chi-Lites' \\"Are You My Woman\\"), Mariah Carey in 2005 with \\"Get Your Number\\" (which samples \\"Just an Illusion\\" by British band Imagination), Jennifer Lopez in 2005 with \\"Get Right\\" (which samples Maceo Parker's \\"Soul Power '74\\" horn sound), and also Amerie with her song \\"1 Thing\\" (which samples the Meters' \\"Oh, Calcutta!\\"). Tamar Braxton in 2013 with \\"The One\\" (which samples \\"Juicy Fruit\\" by Mtume).\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite funk's popularity in modern music, few people have examined the work of funk women. As cultural critic Cheryl Keyes explains in her essay \\"She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis,\\" most of the scholarship around funk has focused on the cultural work of men. She states that \\"Betty Davis is an artist whose name has gone unheralded as a pioneer in the annals of funk and rock. Most writing on these musical genres has traditionally placed male artist like Jimi Hendrix, George Clinton (of Parliament-Funkadelic), and bassist Larry Graham as trendsetters in the shaping of a rock music sensibility\\"[34] (35). Notable funk women include Chaka Khan, Labelle, Brides of Funkenstein, Klymaxx, Mother's Finest, Lyn Collins, Betty Davis and Teena Marie.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the early 1970s onwards, funk has developed various subgenres. While George Clinton and the Parliament were making a harder variation of funk, bands such as Kool and the Gang, Ohio Players and Earth, Wind and Fire were making disco-influenced funk music.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the work of Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s, black funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone pioneered a style known as psychedelic funk by borrowing techniques from psychedelic rock music, including wah pedals, fuzz boxes, echo chambers, and vocal distorters, as well as blues rock and jazz.[36] In the following years, groups such as George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic continued this sensibility, employing synthesizers and rock-oriented guitar work.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunk rock (also written as funk-rock or funk/rock) fuses funk and rock elements.[37] Its earliest incarnation was heard in the late '60s through the mid-'70s by musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, Steely Dan, Herbie Hancock, Return to Forever, Gary Wright, David Bowie, Betty Davis, Mother's Finest, and Funkadelic on their earlier albums.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany instruments may be incorporated into funk rock, but the overall sound is defined by a definitive bass or drum beat and electric guitars.  The bass and drum rhythms are influenced by funk music but with more intensity, while the guitar can be funk-or-rock-influenced, usually with distortion. Prince, Jesse Johnson, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone are major artists in funk rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"avant-funk\\" has been used to describe acts who combined funk with art rock's concerns.[38] Simon Frith described the style as an application of progressive rock mentality to rhythm rather than melody and harmony.[38] Simon Reynolds characterized avant-funk as a kind of psychedelia in which \\"oblivion was to be attained not through rising above the body, rather through immersion in the physical, self loss through animalism.\\"[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nActs in the genre include German krautrock band Can,[39] American funk artists Sly Stone and George Clinton,[40] and a wave of early 1980s UK and US post-punk artists (including Public Image Ltd, Talking Heads, the Pop Group, Cabaret Voltaire, D.A.F., A Certain Ratio, and 23 Skidoo)[41] who embraced black dance music styles such as disco and funk.[42] The artists of the late 1970s New York no wave scene also explored avant-funk, influenced by figures such as Ornette Coleman.[43] Reynolds noted these artists' preoccupations with issues such as alienation, repression and technocracy of Western modernity.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nGo-go originated in the Washington, D.C. area with which it remains associated, along with other spots in the Mid-Atlantic. Inspired by singers such as Chuck Brown, the \\"Godfather of Go-go\\", it is a blend of funk, rhythm and blues, and early hip hop, with a focus on lo-fi percussion instruments and in-person jamming in place of dance tracks.  As such, it is primarily a dance music with an emphasis on live audience call and response.  Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoogie (or electro-funk) is an electronic music mainly influenced by funk and post-disco. The minimalist approach of boogie, consisting of synthesizers and keyboards, helped to establish electro and house music.  Boogie, unlike electro, emphasises the slapping techniques of bass guitar but also bass synthesizers. Artists include Vicky \\"D\\", Komiko, Peech Boys, Kashif, and later Evelyn King.\\r\\n\\r\\nElectro funk is a hybrid of electronic music and funk. It essentially follows the same form as funk, and retains funk's characteristics, but is made entirely (or partially) with a use of electronic instruments such as the TR-808. Vocoders or talkboxes were commonly implemented to transform the vocals. The pioneering Electro band Zapp commonly used such instruments in their music. Other artists include Herbie Hancock, Afrika Bambaataa, Egyptian Lover, Vaughan Mason & Crew, Midnight Star and Cybotron.\\r\\n\\r\\nFunk metal (sometimes typeset differently such as funk-metal) is a fusion genre of music which emerged in the 1980s, as part of the alternative metal movement. It typically incorporates elements of funk and heavy metal (often thrash metal), and in some cases other styles, such as punk and experimental music. It features hard-driving heavy metal guitar riffs, the pounding bass rhythms characteristic of funk, and sometimes hip hop-style rhymes into an alternative rock approach to songwriting. A primary example is the all-African-American rock band Living Colour, who have been said to be \\"funk-metal pioneers\\" by Rolling Stone.[44] During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the style was most prevalent in California ÿ particularly Los Angeles and San Francisco.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nG-funk is a fusion genre of music which combines gangsta rap and funk. It is generally considered to have been invented by west coast rappers and made famous by Dr. Dre. It incorporates multi-layered and melodic synthesizers, slow hypnotic grooves, a deep bass, background female vocals, the extensive sampling of P-Funk tunes, and a high-pitched portamento saw wave synthesizer lead. Unlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as EPMD and the Bomb Squad), G-funk often used fewer, unaltered samples per song.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimba is a form of funky Cuban popular dance music. By 1990, several Cuban bands had incorporated elements of funk and hip-hop into their arrangements, and expanded upon the instrumentation of the traditional conjunto with American drum set, saxophones and a two-keyboard format. Timba bands like La Charanga Habanera or Bamboleo often have horns or other instruments playing short parts of tunes by Earth, Wind and Fire, Kool and the Gang or other U.S. funk bands.  While many funk motifs exhibit a clave-based structure, they are created intuitively, without a conscious intent of aligning the various parts to a guide-pattern. Timba incorporates funk motifs into an overt and intentional clave structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the Cuban congas and timbales, the drum set provided powerful clave-based funk patterns that added more punch to the rhythm section. Funk is especially evident in timba's breakdown sections. The following example is Calixto Oviedo's funky drumset pattern for a type of high-energy breakdown known as presi܇n.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nTimba bass players incorporated techniques associated with funk, such as slapping, and pulling the strings in a percussive way. The following excerpt demonstrates several funk characteristics of timba bass. This is Alain Prez's bass tumbao from a performance of Issac Delgado piece \\"La vida sin esperanza.\\" Prez's playful interpretation of the tumbao is what timba authority Kevin Moore refers to as \\"controlled improvisation;\\" the pattern continuously varies within a set framework.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nFunk jam is a fusion genre of music which emerged in the 1990s. It typically incorporates elements of funk and often exploratory guitar, along with extended cross genre improvisations; often including elements of jazz, ambient, electronic, Americana, and hip hop including improvised lyrics. Phish, Soul Rebels Brass Band, Galactic, Soulive are all examples of funk bands that play funk jam.","input":"When approximately did the genre of funk surface?"},{"output":"Malta","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nStatistics in the European Union are collected by Eurostat (European statistics body).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 1 January 2006, the population of the EU was about 493 million people.[1] Many countries are expected to experience a decline in population over the coming decades,[2] though this could be offset with new countries planning to join the EU within the next 20 years.

The three races were inaugurated in different years, the last being the Kentucky Derby in 1875. These races are now run annually in May and early June of each year. The Triple Crown Trophy, commissioned in 1950 but awarded to all previous winners as well as those after 1950, is awarded to a Triple Crown winner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first winner of all three Triple Crown races was Sir Barton in 1919. Some journalists began using the term Triple Crown to refer to the three races as early as 1923, but it was not until Gallant Fox won the three events in 1930 that Charles Hatton of the Daily Racing Form put the term into common use.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the history of the Triple Crown, 13 horses have won all three races: Sir Barton (1919), Gallant Fox (1930), Omaha (1935), War Admiral (1937), Whirlaway (1941), Count Fleet (1943), Assault (1946), Citation (1948), Secretariat (1973), Seattle Slew (1977), Affirmed (1978), American Pharoah (2015), and Justify (2018).

Although fillies have won each of the individual Triple Crown races, none has won the Triple Crown itself.[5]  Despite attempts to develop a \\"Filly Triple Crown\\" or a \\"Triple Tiara\\" for fillies only, no set series of three races has consistently remained in the public eye, and at least four different configurations of races have been used.  Two fillies won the series of the Kentucky Oaks, the Pimlico Oaks (now the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes), and the Coaching Club American Oaks, in 1949 and 1952, but the racing press did not designate either accomplishment as a \\"triple crown\\".  In 1961, the New York Racing Association created a filly triple crown of in-state races only, but the races changed over the years.  Eight fillies won the NYRA Triple Tiara between 1968 and 1993.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nGelded colts may run in any of the three races today, but they were prohibited from entering the Belmont between 1919 and 1957. Geldings have won each of the individual races,[7][8] but like fillies, no gelding has ever won the Triple Crown. The closest was Funny Cide, who won the Derby and the Preakness in 2003.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the races are held on dirt tracks, rather than the turf commonly used for important races in Europe.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt completion of the 2016 season, the three Triple Crown races have attracted 4,224 entrants. Of these, 292 horses have won a single leg of the Triple Crown, 52 horses have won two of the races (23 the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, 18 the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes, and 11 the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes), and 13 horses have won all three races. Pillory won both the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes in 1922, a year when it was impossible to win the Triple Crown because the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes were run on the same day.\\r\\n\\r\\n10 of the 13 winners have been \\"homebreds\\", owned at the time of their win by their breeders.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Fitzsimmons and Bob Baffert are the only two trainers to have two horses win the Triple Crown, with Fitzsimmons training the sire/son combination of 1930 winner Gallant Fox and 1935 winner Omaha and Baffert training 2015 winner American Pharoah and 2018 winner Justify. The wins by Fitzsimmons were also the first time that an owner and the first time that a breeder, Belair Stud holding both duties, had a repeat win of the Triple Crown. Calumet Farm is the only other owner with two Triple Crown horses, 1941 winner Whirlaway and 1948 winner Citation. Eddie Arcaro is the only jockey to ride two horses to the Triple Crown, both for Calumet, Whirlaway and Citation. Those two horses' trainers, Ben Jones and Jimmy Jones, were father and son.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll 13 horses, and most owners, trainers, and jockeys were born in the United States. The exceptions were jockey Johnny Longden, born in England and raised in Canada; French-born jockey Jean Cruguet; trainer Laz Barrera, from Cuba; and jockey Victor Espinoza, from Mexico. Secretariat's trainer, Lucien Laurin and jockey, Ron Turcotte were both Canadians. Owner Fannie Hertz was married to John D. Hertz, who was born in Slovakia; owner Ahmed Zayat was born in Egypt. Jockey Willie Saunders is considered a Canadian jockey because he grew up and established his career there, but was born in Montana. The horse Sir Barton was foaled in the United States but had a Canadian owner,  J. K. L. Ross, at the time of his Triple Crown win, while Justify's owners were from both the United States and China.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretariat holds the stakes record for each of the Triple Crown races, the Kentucky Derby (1:59 2/5), the Preakness Stakes (1:53), and the Belmont Stakes (2:24).[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 18, Steve Cauthen became the youngest jockey to win the Triple Crown, riding Affirmed in 1978. At 52, Mike Smith became the oldest jockey to win the Triple Crown, riding Justify in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one horse, Alydar, has placed (finished second) in all three races. He was defeated by Affirmed in all three races in 1978 by a combined margin of two lengths. His trainer John Veitch is the only trainer to have done this with one horse. In 1995, D. Wayne Lukas became the first and only major figure (owner, jockey, or trainer) to win all three Triple Crown races with different horses, Thunder Gulch in the Derby and Belmont, Timber Country in the Preakness.  Lukas also is the only trainer to have won six straight Triple Crown races, adding his 1995 wins, having won the 1994 Preakness and Belmont with Tabasco Cat and the 1996 Derby with Grindstone.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Veitch, only with two different horses, Bob Baffert also had second-place finishes in all three legs of the Triple Crown, both owned by Ahmed Zayat: in 2012, Bodemeister finished second in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness stakes to I'll Have Another, then Paynter was entered and finished second to Union Rags.[21]  Baffert and Zayat teamed up again for the 2015 Triple Crown victory of American Pharoah.\\r\\n\\r\\nGallant Fox is the only Triple Crown winner to sire another U.S. Triple Crown winner, Omaha. Affirmed sired Peteski, winner of the 1993 Canadian Triple Crown.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhirlaway, in addition to winning the 1941 Triple Crown, also won the Travers Stakes that year, becoming the first and only horse to date to accomplish that feat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Pharoah, in addition to winning the 2015 Triple Crown, also won the Breeders' Cup Classic that year. As the Breeders' Cup was not established until 1984, American Pharoah was the first (and, as of 2018, only) horse to sweep all four races, a feat that came to be known as the Grand Slam.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first Triple Crown winner, Sir Barton, in 1919, there was not another winner until Gallant Fox in 1930, a gap of 11 years. Between 1930 and 1948, seven horses won the Triple Crown, with five years being the longest gap between winners. However, following the 1948 win of Citation, there was a considerable gap of 25 years before Secretariat ended the drought of Triple Crown champions in 1973. Between 1973 and 1978, there were three Triple Crown winners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Affirmed's Triple Crown in 1978, the longest drought in Triple Crown history began in 1979 with Spectacular Bid's failed Triple Crown attempt at the Belmont Stakes, and lasted until American Pharoah won in 2015. Between 1979 and 2014 thirteen horses won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, but either failed to win the Belmont Stakes or could not start in the race. Of those, Real Quiet came the closest to winning the Triple Crown, losing the Belmont Stakes by a nose in 1998. \\r\\nSpectacular Bid finished 3rd in 1979.\\r\\nPleasant Colony finished 3rd in 1981.\\r\\nAlysheba finished 4th in 1987.\\r\\nSunday Silence finished 2nd in 1989.\\r\\nReal Quiet finished 2nd in 1998.\\r\\nCharismatic finished 3rd in 1999.\\r\\nWar Emblem finished 8th in 2002.\\r\\nFunny Cide finished 3rd in 2003.\\r\\nSmarty Jones finished 2nd in 2004.\\r\\nBig Brown did not finish in 2008.\\r\\nI'll Have Another did not start (injury) 2012.\\r\\nCalifornia Chrome finished 4th in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1979-2015 period, horses who contested all three races, losing the Kentucky Derby but winning the Preakness and the Belmont were Risen Star in 1988, Hansel in 1991, Tabasco Cat in 1994, Point Given in 2001, and Afleet Alex in 2005. In 1984, Swale and in 1995, Thunder Gulch ran all three races, winning the Derby and the Belmont, but not the Preakness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 37-year gap between the Triple Crown wins of Affirmed and American Pharoah drew criticism of the system. As far back as 1986, reporters noted that horses who were fresh for the Belmont had an advantage.[25]  In 2003, Gary Stevens stated in an interview with Charlie Rose that he did not believe there would be another Triple Crown winner because of the tendency for owners to put fresh horses in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.[26] California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn was particularly critical of the Triple Crown system in post-Belmont remarks in 2014; he considered the system to be unfair, arguing that there would never be another Triple Crown winner in his lifetime unless only horses that competed in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness competed at the Belmont. By 2014, six of the previous eight Belmont winners had not competed in either of the first two legs of the Triple Crown.[27]  Additionally, from 2006 to 2014, the Belmont winner was a horse who had not competed in the Preakness.[28] American Pharoah was the first Belmont winner since Afleet Alex in 2005 to have run all three Triple Crown races.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince all three races were inaugurated, as of  2017[update], 23 horses have won the Derby and Preakness but not the Belmont:\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the three races largely organized their own nominations procedure, marketing and television broadcast rights. In 1985, Triple Crown Productions was created when the owner of Spend a Buck chose not to run in the other two Triple Crown races because of a financial incentive offered to any Kentucky Derby winner who could win a set of competing races in New Jersey. The organizers of the three races realized that they needed to work together.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nEfforts to unify the sponsorship and marketing of all three Triple Crown races began in 1987 when ABC Sports negotiated a deal with Chrysler to pay $5 million to any horse that swept all three races, and $1 million each year there was no Triple Crown sweep to the horse with the highest combined Triple Crown finish.[46]  This sponsorship lasted until 1993. The end of the $1 million participation bonus was linked to the breakdown of Prairie Bayou at the Belmont Stakes that year and the uncomfortable situation that arose when the Kentucky Derby winner, Sea Hero, was given the bonus following a seventh-place finish.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, Visa USA took over the sponsorship with a 10-year contract, naming the series the Visa Triple Crown and offering only the $5 million bonus to a horse that could sweep the Triple Crown.[47] Along with sponsorship by VISA, NBC Sports paid $51.5 million for broadcast rights to all three races, with the revenue split giving 50% of the total to Churchill Downs and 25% each to Pimlico and to the New York Racing Association (NYRA).[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Visa dealand the cooperative effortended after 2005. The NYRA felt that they did not get a fair share of the revenue, particularly when the Belmont had the highest ratings of all three races in the years where a Triple Crown was on the line.[45]  From 2001 through 2013, average viewership for the Belmont was 7 million when the Triple Crown was not at stake, whereas viewership averaged 13 million when it was.[a][48]  With the contract term ending, the NYRA went to ESPN on ABC for the 2006 Belmont, while the broadcasts of the Derby and Preakness remained with NBC.[45] Visa chose to remain as a sponsor of only Kentucky Derby for the next five years.[47] As a result of the divided broadcast, Triple Crown Productions was unable to obtain a new sponsor.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2011, ABC/ESPN dropped out of the negotiations to renew broadcast rights to the Belmont Stakes. NBC obtained the contract through 2015, once again uniting all three races on the same network.[49][50][51]  In 2014, NBC extended their contract for the Kentucky Derby through 2025.[52] As of  August 2015[update], NBC obtained a broadcast contract for the Belmont through 2020 and the Preakness through 2022.[53]","input":"Who won the last horse racing triple crown?"},{"output":"began in August 2006","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nYankee Stadium is a stadium located in the Concourse neighborhood of the Bronx in New York City. It serves as the home ballpark for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB), and is also the home park for New York City FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). The $2.3 billion stadium, built with $1.2 billion in public subsidies,[20] replaced the original Yankee Stadium in 2009. It is located one block north of the original, on the 24-acre (9.7?ha) former site of Macombs Dam Park; the 8-acre (3.2?ha) site of the original stadium is now a public park called Heritage Field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium incorporates replicas of some design elements from the original Yankee Stadium, and like its predecessor, it has hosted additional events, including college football games, soccer matches, two outdoor NHL games, and concerts. Although Yankee Stadium's construction began in August 2006, the project spanned many years and faced many controversies, including the high public cost and the loss of public parkland. The overall price tag makes the new Yankee Stadium the most expensive stadium ever built.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner began campaigning for a new stadium in the early 1980s, just a few years after the remodeled Yankee Stadium opened. Steinbrenner at the time was reportedly considering a move to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey. New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean in 1984 authorized the use of land for a new baseball stadium in the Meadowlands, but the state legislature did not provide financing for the stadium.[25] In a statewide referendum in 1987, New Jersey taxpayers rejected $185 million in public financing for a baseball stadium for the Yankees.[26] Despite the rejection from New Jersey, Steinbrenner frequently used a threatened move there as leverage in negotiations with New York City.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, Mayor Ed Koch agreed to have city taxpayers spend $90 million on a second renovation of Yankee Stadium that included luxury boxes and restaurants inside the stadium and parking garages and traffic improvements outside. Steinbrenner agreed in principle, but then backed out of the deal. In 1993, Mayor David Dinkins expanded on Koch's proposal by offering his Bronx Center vision for the neighborhood, including new housing, a new courthouse, and relocating the Police Academy nearby.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, New York Governor Mario Cuomo proposed using the West Side Yard, a 30-acre rail yard along the West Side of Manhattan and owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, as the location for a new stadium for the Yankees. However, Cuomo lost his re-election bid a few months later. By 1995, Steinbrenner had rejected 13 proposals to keep the Yankees in the Bronx.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer proposed spending $600 million in public money to add dozens of luxury boxes to the stadium, to improve highway and public transportation access, and to create a Yankee Village, with shops, restaurants, and a museum. Steinbrenner rejected this as well. That same year, Mayor Rudy Giuliani unveiled a plan to relocate the Yankees to the West Side Yard for a $1 billion stadium. However, with most of the funding coming from taxpayers, Giuliani tabled the proposal, fearing rejection in a citywide referendum. The West Side Stadium plan resurfaced in December 2001, and by January 2002, months after the September 11 attacks, Giuliani announced \\"tentative agreements\\" for both the New York Yankees and New York Mets to build new stadiums. He estimated that both stadiums would cost $2 billion, with city and state taxpayers contributing $1.2 billion.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Bloomberg, who succeeded Giuliani as mayor in 2002, called the former mayor's agreements \\"corporate welfare\\" and exercised the escape clause in the agreements to back out of both deals, saying that the city could not afford to build new stadiums for the Yankees and Mets. Bloomberg said that Giuliani had inserted a clause in this deal which loosened the teams' leases with the city and would allow the Yankees and Mets to leave the city on 60 days' notice to find a new home elsewhere if the city backed out of the agreement. At the time, Bloomberg said that publicly funded stadiums were a poor investment. Bloomberg's blueprint for the stadium was unveiled in 2004, at the same time as the plan for the Mets' new stadium, Citi Field. The final cost for the two stadiums was more than $3.1 billion; taxpayer subsidies accounted for $1.8 billion.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nGroundbreaking ceremonies for the stadium took place on August 16, 2006, the 58th anniversary of Babe Ruth's death, with Steinbrenner, Bloomberg and then-Governor of New York George Pataki among the notables donning Yankees hard hats and wielding ceremonial shovels to mark the occasion.[30][31] The Yankees continued to play in the previous Yankee Stadium during the 2007 and 2008 seasons while their new home stadium was built across the street. The community was left without parkland for five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring construction of the new stadium, a construction worker and avid Boston Red Sox fan buried a replica jersey of Red Sox player David Ortiz underneath the visitors' dugout with the objective of placing a \\"hex\\" on the Yankees, much like the \\"Curse of the Bambino\\" that had allegedly plagued the Red Sox long after trading Ruth to the Yankees. After the worker was exposed by co-workers, he was forced to help exhume the jersey.[32] The Yankees organization then donated the retrieved jersey to the Jimmy Fund, a charity started in 1948 by the Red Sox' National League rivals, the Boston Braves, but long championed by the Red Sox and particularly associated with Ted Williams.[33][34] The worker has since claimed to have buried a 2004 American League Championship Series program/scorecard, but has not said where he placed it.[35] These attempts didn't have much effect upon the home team, though: the Yankees went on to win the 2009 World Series at the end of their first MLB season in the new stadium.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new stadium is meant to evoke elements of the original Yankee Stadium, both in its original 1923 state and its post-renovation state in 1976. The exterior resembles the original look of the 1923 Yankee Stadium. The interior, a modern ballpark with greater space and increased amenities, features a playing field that closely mimics the 1988ÿ2008 dimensions of the old stadium. The current stadium features 4,300 club seats and 68 luxury suites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium was designed by the architectural firm Populous. The exterior was made from 11,000 pieces of Indiana limestone, along with granite and pre-cast concrete.[37] It features the building's name V-cut and gold-leaf lettered above each gate.[37]  The interior of the stadium is adorned with hundreds of photographs capturing the history of the Yankees. The New York Daily News newspaper partnered with the Yankees for the exhibition \\"The Glory of the Yankees Photo Collection\\", which was selected from the Daily News' collection of over 2,000 photographs.[38] Sports & The Arts was hired by the Yankees to curate the nearly 1,300 photographs that adorn the building from sources including the Daily News, Getty Images, the Baseball Hall of Fame and Major League Baseball.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seats are laid out similar to the original stadium's stands, with grandstand seating that stretches beyond the foul poles, as well as bleacher seats beyond the outfield fences. The Field Level and Main Level comprise the lower bowl, with suites on the H&R Block Level, and the Upper Level and Grandstand Level comprising the upper bowl.[39] Approximately ?2?3 of the stadium's seating is in the lower bowl, the inverse from the original Yankee Stadium.[39] 50,287 fans can be seated, with a standing room capacity of 52,325.[40] The new stadium's seating is spaced outward in a bowl, unlike the stacked-tiers design at the old stadium. This design places most fans farther back but lower to the field, by about an average of 30 feet (9.1?m). Over 56 suites are located within the ballpark, triple the amount from the previous stadium.[37] Seats are 19ÿ24 inches (48ÿ61?cm) wide, up from the previous stadium's 18ÿ22-inch (46ÿ56?cm) wide seats, while there is 33ÿ39 inches (84ÿ99?cm) of leg room, up from 29.5 inches (75?cm) of leg room in the previous stadium.[39] Many lower level seats are cushioned, while all seats are equipped with cupholders.[39] To allow for the extra seating space, the stadium's capacity is reduced by more than 4,000 seats in comparison to the previous stadium.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany design elements of the ballpark's interior are inspired by the original Yankee Stadium. The roof of the new facility features a replica of the frieze that was a trademark of the previous ballpark.[39] In the original Yankee Stadium, a copper frieze originally lined the roof of the upper deck stands, but it was torn down during the 1974ÿ75 renovations and replicated atop the wall beyond the bleachers.[39] The new stadium replicates the frieze in its original location along the upper deck stands.[39] Made of steel coated with zinc for rust protection, it is part of the support system for the cantilevers holding up the top deck and the lighting on the roof.[41] The wall beyond the bleacher seats is \\"cut out\\" to reveal the 4 subway trains as they pass by, like they were in the original facility. A manually operated auxiliary scoreboard is built into the left and right field fences, in the same locations it existed in the pre-renovation iteration of the original Yankee Stadium.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the exterior perimeter wall and interior of the stadium is the \\"Great Hall\\", a large concourse that runs between Gates 4 and 6.[42] With seven-story ceilings, the Great Hall features more than 31,000 square feet (2,900?m2) of retail space and is lined with 20 banners of past and present Yankees superstars.[42] The Great Hall features a 5-by-383-foot (1.5 by 116.7?m) LED (light-emitting diode) ribbon display as well as a 25' by 36' LED video display above the entrance to the ballpark from Daktronics, a company in Brookings, South Dakota.[42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nMonument Park, which features the Yankees' retired numbers, as well as monuments and plaques dedicated to distinguished Yankees, has been moved from its location beyond the left field fences in the original Yankee Stadium to its new location beyond the center field fences at the new facility. The newly relocated Monument Park is now situated under the sports bar; black shades cover the monuments on the back wall during games to prevent interference with the vision of the batter.[44]  The new location of the monuments is meant to mirror their original placement in center field at the original pre-renovation Yankee Stadium, albeit when they were on the playing field. The transfer of Monument Park from the old stadium to the new stadium began on November 10, 2008.[45] The first monuments were put in place on February 23, 2009.[46] Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera requested that the Yankees reposition the team's bullpen, as well as add a door to connect the Yankees' bullpen to Monument Park, in order to allow access to it by Yankee relievers. The organization complied with his request.[37][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe field dimensions for the outfield fences have the same distance markers as the original facility prior to closing yet the dimensions are not identical.[48]  Due to the design of the right-field stands and the inclusion of an embedded manual scoreboard, the right-field wall is an average of 5 feet (1.5?m) closer to home plate.[49] Overall, the fences measure 318 feet (97?m) to left field, 399 feet (122?m) to left-center field, 408 feet (124?m) to center field, 385 feet (117?m) to right-center field, and 314 feet (96?m) to right field.[39][40] At the old Yankee Stadium, the right field wall curved from the right-field corner to straightaway center, while at the new ballpark the fence takes a sharp, almost entirely straight angle.[49]  This results in a difference at certain points between the right field markers of as much as 9 feet (2.7?m).[49]  The dimensions in left field are substantially the same despite the presence of an embedded auxiliary scoreboard there as well.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outfield fences measure 8?feet 5?inches (2.57?m) high from the left-field foul pole until the Yankees' bullpen, when the fences begin to gradually descend in height until the right field foul pole, where they are only 8 feet (2.4?m) tall.[39] This also marks a decrease from the previous Yankee Stadium, where the outfield walls stood at a height of approximately 10 feet (3.0?m).[48] The distance from home plate to the backstop is 52?feet 4?inches (15.95?m), a reduction of 20 feet (6.1?m) from the previous facility.[40] The field is made up of Kentucky bluegrass, the same surface as the previous stadium, which is grown on a 1,300 acres (530?ha) farm in Bridgeton, New Jersey. The grass is equipped with a drainage system (featuring over 14,000 feet (4,300?m) of pipe) that makes the field playable an hour after taking 2 inches (51?mm) of rain.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nYankee Stadium features a wide array of amenities. It contains 63% more space, 500,000 square feet (46,000?m2) more in total, than the previous stadium, with wider concourses and open sight lines on concourses.[37] Along with 227 miles (365?km) of wired Ethernet cable, the building has sufficient fiber-optic cable wiring that Cisco Vice President and Treasurer David Holland calls the building \\"future proof\\".[37] Over 1,100 high-definition video monitors are placed within the stadium and approximately $10 million worth of baseball merchandise is housed within the ballpark.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe center field scoreboard, manufactured by Mitsubishi Diamond Vision, measures 59 x 101 feet (31?m) and offers 5,925 square feet (550.5?m2) of viewing area. It was the third-largest high definition scoreboard in the world when it opened (behind the 8,736-square-foot (811.6?m2) board at newly renovated Kauffman Stadium and the new 8,066-square-foot (749.4?m2) board at the renovated Tokyo Racecourse).[50] Since then, it has also been surpassed by the world's largest scoreboard at AT&T Stadium and the new scoreboard at the Philadelphia Phillies' Citizens Bank Park.[51][52] Displaying 5,925?ft (1,806?m)2 of video, the scoreboard can display four 1080p high definition images simultaneously.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Yankees clubhouse features 30,000 square feet (2,880 m2) of space, over 2.5 times the space of the clubhouse from the previous facility.[53] The dressing area alone features 3,344?sq?ft (310.7?m2) of space, with each locker equipped with a safety deposit box and touch-screen computer.[53] The Yankees clubhouse features a weight room, training room, video room, and lounge area, while both teams' clubhouses have their own indoor batting cages.[53] The Yankees' therapy room features a hydrotherapy pool with an underwater treadmill.[53] The Yankees are believed to be the first team to chemically treat their uniforms, as well as the showering surfaces with an anti-bacterial agent that reduces the risk of infection.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Yankees Museum, located on the lower level at Gate 6, displays a wide range of Yankees' memorabilia.[54] A \\"Ball Wall\\" features hundreds of balls autographed by past and present Yankees, and there are plans to eventually add autographs for every living player who has played for the Yankees.[54] The centerpiece of the museum is a tribute to Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, with a commemorative home plate in the floor and statues of Larsen pitching to Yogi Berra.[54] Along with a facsimile of a current locker from the Yankees' clubhouse, fans can view the locker of the late Thurman Munson, which sat unoccupied in the previous stadium's Yankee clubhouse in honor of Munson.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ballpark offers a wide choice of restaurants. There are 25 fixed concessions stands, along with 112 movable ones.[42] A Hard Rock Cafe is located within the ballpark, but it is open to anyone at the 161st St. and River Ave. entrance year round.[42] The Hard Rock Cafe at Yankee Stadium officially opened on March 30, 2009, and an opening ceremony took place on April 2, 2009.[55] A steakhouse called NYY Steak is located beyond right field.[42] Celebrity chefs will occasionally make appearances at the ballpark's restaurants and help prepare food for fans in premium seating over the course of the season.[42] Above Monument Park in center field is the Mohegan Sun sports bar, whose tinted black glass acts as the ballpark's batter's eye. After the 2016 season, the Yankees began doing updates to Yankee Stadium including the Masterpass Batter's Eye Deck and Frank's Red Hot Terrace and Toyota Terrace. The Masterpass Batter's Eye Deck above the Mohegan Sun sports bar is an outdoor gathering space in center field with clear full views of the playing field available to all ticketed guests. The Frank's Red Hot Terrace and Toyota Terrace overlook the visitors' and Yankees' bullpens respectively. The new AT&T Sports Lounge is behind section 134 on the main level and features a full bar, tables, stools and large screen TVs. The new Budweiser Party Decks located at sections 311 and 328 in the upper deck feature shaded standalone bar areas serving beer, cocktails and food. There is a new SunRun Kids Clubhouse located on the 300 level in right field and outfitted with Yankees-themed playground equipment.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Yankee Stadium has been praised for its amenities, it also has been widely criticized for high ticket prices.[57][58] Seats within the first eight rows in the lower bowl, called the \\"Legends Suite\\", are among the highest-priced tickets in professional sports. Tickets cost $510 on average; the most expensive tickets cost $2,600 each.[57] Legends Suite Seats have been regularly empty, with many ticket holders in this section having given up their tickets, and others remaining unsold, despite most other seats in the ballpark selling out. This has created an embarrassing image on television of the seats behind home plate being almost completely vacant.[57] Consequently, a surplus of tickets for Legends Seats have emerged in the secondary market, and with supply exceeding demand, resale prices have dropped. Empty seats in the Legends Suite could even be seen during the 2009 playoffs, including World Series games. Even though all playoff games were sellouts, Legends Suite ticket holders were in the lounges and the restaurant underneath instead of their seats.[59][60] Overall, the average ticket price is $63, the highest in baseball.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nLegends Suite seats are also separate from the other lower bowl seating and are vigorously patrolled by stadium security, with the divider being described as a \\"concrete moat.\\"[57][58] Fans who do not have tickets within this premium section in the front rows are not allowed in the section. This includes standing behind the dugouts during batting practice and to seek autographs.[57][58] The least expensive seats, the bleachers, initially left many fans disappointed, as the indoor club seating area in center field obstructed the views from bleacher seats on both sides in sections 201 and 239. These severely obstructed sections would ultimately be removed during the 2016-2017 off-season in favor of outdoor bars and patio called Franks Red Hot Terrace in left center and Toyota Terrace in right center. These new areas are complete with standing terraces accessible to all ticket holders, in addition to replacing the seating on top of the center field club with standing terraces, drastically reducing the number of obstructed views from center field in the process.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Yankee Stadium staff was also criticized for an incident during a May 4, 2009 game, which was interrupted by a rain delay.[63] Fans were told by some staff members that the game was unlikely to resume and consequently, many fans exited the stadium, only for the game to eventually resume play.[63] The fans that left the ballpark were not permitted to re-enter, per the stadium's re-entry policy, and many subsequently got into arguments with stadium personnel.[63] In response to the backlash the Yankees received for the incident, the staff members were required to sign a gag order preventing them from speaking to media, but they did indicate that communication for rain delays would be improved.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the stadium's first season, cracks were seen on the concrete ramps of the Stadium. The Yankees are trying to determine whether there was something wrong with the concrete, or the ramps' installation or design. The company involved in inspecting the concrete was indicted on charges that its employees either faked or failed to perform some required tests and falsified the results of others.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium has also been criticized for its lack of fan noise. During a Sunday Night Baseball telecast in 2012, commentator and former Red Sox manager Terry Francona spoke about the different atmospheres in the old and new stadiums saying that \\"As a visiting team, especially for the Red Sox, by the time the (national) anthem was over, you couldn't wait to get back in the dugout. Now (there is) a little different (kind) of fan sitting around down there by the dugout.\\" Games at the new stadium do not feature the same deafening crowd moments and often sound eerily silent.[65] The lack of fan noise was noticeable in the 2012 playoffs as well, with thousands of unsold seats for Game 5 of the ALDS and Games 1 and 2 of the ALCS. \\"This is a very easy place to play now\\", said Quintin Berry of the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees' ALCS opponents. \\"Coming from Oakland, the fans there were so rowdy. It was easier to come here.\\"[66] In his autobiography \\"The Closer\\", the Yankees' longtime relief pitcher Mariano Rivera wrote these comments about the new stadium's atmosphere: \\"It doesnt hold noise, or home-team fervor, anywhere near the way the old place did. The old Stadium was our 10th mana loud and frenzied cauldron of pinstriped passion, with a lot of lifers in the stands. Maybe Im wrong, but it's hard to see that the new place can ever quite duplicate that.\\"[67] Derek Jeter echoed this sentiment in a September 2014 article in New York magazine, in which he said he missed the original Yankee Stadium: \\"It was a different feel. The new stadium, it's second to noneall the amenities. For the players, it really doesnt get any better. The old stadium, if you were at the stadium, in the stands, the only place you could see the game was in your seat. Now there's so many suites and places people can go. So a lot of times it looks like it's empty, but it's really not. The old stadium, it was more intimidating. The fans were right on top of you.\\"[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its first season, Yankee Stadium quickly acquired a reputation as a \\"bandbox\\" and a \\"launching pad\\" because of the high number of home runs hit at the new ballpark.[69][70][71][72][73][74]  Through its first 23 games, 87 home runs were hit at the venue, easily besting Enron Field's (now called Minute Maid Park) previous record set in 2000.[75]  Early in the season, Yankee Stadium was on pace to break Coors Field's 1999 single-season record of 303 home runs allowed, and the hometown Daily News (using the back-page headline \\"HOMERS ODYSSEY\\") started publishing a daily graphic comparing each stadium's home run totals through a similar number of games.\\r\\n\\r\\nESPN commentator Peter Gammons denounced the new facility as \\"one of the biggest jokes in baseball\\" during an appearance on Mike and Mike in the Morning, and concluded that \\"[it] was not a very well-planned ballpark\\".[71]  Likewise, Gammons' ESPN colleague Buster Olney described the stadium as \\"a veritable wind tunnel\\"[69] and likened it to his childhood Wiffle-ball park.[76] Newsday columnist Wallace Matthews joined in the criticism, labeling the stadium \\"ridiculous\\" and accused \\"the franchise that took ownership of the home run\\" of cheapening it.  He suggested that Babe Ruth could have potentially hit 120 or more homers if he played in the new Stadium.  For his column, Matthews interviewed former Yankee Reggie Jackson, who termed the park \\"too small\\" to contain current player Alex Rodriguez.  Jackson estimated that the park might enable the third baseman to hit 75 home runs in a season.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nA variety of theories have been posited to account for the dramatic increase in home runs at the new Yankee Stadium over the original stadium, foremost among these the sharper angles of the outfield walls[49] and the speculated presence of a wind tunnel.[69]  During construction of the new ballpark, engineers commissioned a wind study, the results of which indicated there would be no noticeable difference between the two stadiums.[77]  The franchise planned a second study, but Major League rules prohibit a team from making any changes to the playing field until the off-season.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn independent study by the weather service provider AccuWeather in June 2009 concluded that the shape and height of the right field wall, rather than the wind, is responsible for the proliferation of home runs at the stadium.[78]  AccuWeather's analysis found that roughly 20% of the home runs hit at the new ballpark would not have been home runs at the old ballpark due to the gentle curve of its right field corner, and its 10-foot (3.0?m) wall height.[78]  Nothing was observed in wind speeds and patterns that would account for the increase.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of home runs hit at the new stadium slowed significantly as the season progressed,[79] but a new single-season record for most home runs hit at a Yankee home ballpark was nonetheless set in the Yankees' 73rd home game of 2009 when Vladimir Guerrero of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim hit the 216th home run of the season at the venue, surpassing the previous record of 215 set at the original Yankee Stadium in 2005.[80] However, the Yankees offense, as in previous years, had employed many home run hitters in 2009. The Yankees hit 108 home runs while playing on the road, the second most in baseball behind the Philadelphia Phillies.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the early rate of home runs were markedly less through May 15, 2010, with 35 home runs hit in 14 games for 2.5 per game (a projection of 205in 2009, the stadium finished at 2.93 per game for a total of 237). Even though the stadium's home run rate decreased slightly for the 2010 season to 2.73 per game, it was still the highest figure in the majors.[82] However, the prolific home run rate of April and May 2009 that drew criticism has not sustained itself over any season thus far, and while through the first two months of the 2011 season the Yankees hit far more homers than any other team in the majors,[83] Yankee Stadium was not the top home run park.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the official Opening Day against the Cleveland Indians on April 16, 2009, the Yankees hosted a two-game exhibition series at the stadium in early April against the Chicago Cubs.[84] Grady Sizemore of the Indians was the first player to hit a grand slam off of Yankee pitcher Dmaso Marte. The Indians and 2008 Cy Young Award winner Cliff Lee spoiled the opening of the new stadium by winning 10ÿ2. Before the Yankees went to bat for the first time, the bat that Babe Ruth used to hit his first home run at the old Yankee Stadium in 1923 was placed momentarily on home plate.[85] Jorge Posada hit the first Yankee home run in the new ballpark hitting his off Lee in the same game. Russell Branyan, while playing for the Seattle Mariners, was the first player to hit a home run off of the Mohegan Sun Restaurant in center field.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike its predecessor, the new Yankee Stadium hosted the World Series in its very first season; in the 2009 World Series, the Yankees defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 4 games to 2. It also became the latest stadium to host a World Series-clinching victory by its home team in the venue's first season (after the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series at Busch Stadium in 2006), when, on November 4, 2009, the Yankees won their 27th World Series championship against the Phillies. The Yankees are the only team to inaugurate two stadiums with World Series wins and also appeared in the 1976 World Series following the refurbishment of the original Yankee Stadium, losing to the Big Red Machine in four straight. On October 6, 2011 Detroit Tigers in game five of the ALDS were the first team to eliminate the Yankees at the new Yankee Stadium in the postseason.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany historic milestones and records have been achieved at Yankee Stadium.  In 2009, Derek Jeter became the Yankees all-time hits leader with his 2,722nd hit, surpassing Lou Gehrig's 72-year record.[86]  The following season, Alex Rodriguez hit his 600th home run at the Stadium, becoming the youngest player to accomplish the feat.[87]  In 2011, three significant milestones were achieved at the stadium.  In July, Jeter became the first Yankee to join the 3,000 hit club and collect all 3,000 hits with the franchise.[88]  The following month, the Yankees became the first team in history to hit three grand slams in a single game.[89] As the regular season drew to a close, Mariano Rivera became the all-time leader in regular season saves, when he earned his 602nd save.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 20, 2016, the Oakland Athletics' Kendall Graveman became the first starting pitcher to bat at Yankee Stadium.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium is reachable via the 161st Street ÿ Yankee Stadium station complex, the same that served the old Yankee Stadium, by the 4?, B, and ?D trains of the New York City Subway. It is also served by the Yankees ÿ East 153rd Street station of the Metro-North Railroad, opened on May 23, 2009;[92] this station routinely features Hudson Line train service, but on game days, Harlem Line and New Haven Line trains from upstate New York and Connecticutas well as shuttle trains from Grand Central Terminal--also stop there. The stadium is also served by the Bx1, Bx2, Bx6, Bx6 SBS, and Bx13 New York City Bus routes.  For selected games, SeaStreak provides high-speed ferry service to Highlands, New Jersey.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nYankee Stadium is accessible by car via the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87), with connections to the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95), Bruckner Expressway (I-278), and other highways and roads. Aside from existing parking lots and garages serving the stadium, construction for additional parking garages is planned. The New York State Legislature agreed to $70 million in subsidies for a $320 million parking garage project. On October 9, 2007, the New York City Industrial Development Agency approved $225 million in tax-exempt bonds to finance construction of three new parking garages that will have 3,600 new parking spaces, and renovation of the existing 5,569 parking spaces nearby.[94] Plans initially called for a fourth new garage, but this was eliminated before the final approval. The garages will be built (and renovated) by the Community Initiatives Development Corporation of Hudson, New York, a nonprofit entity that will use the parking revenue to repay the bonds and pay a $3 million yearly land lease to the City of New York. Parking is expected to cost $25 per game.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the 2012 World Football Challenge, Chelsea played Paris Saint-Germain on July 22, 2012 in the first soccer (football) match at Yankee Stadium, the match ended in a 1ÿ1 tie, before a crowd of 38,202. The Stadium hosted another soccer match between A.C. Milan and Real Madrid on August 8, 2012. Real Madrid won 5-1, before a crowd of 49,474.[95] Chelsea also played Manchester City there on May 25, 2013, which ended in a 5-3 win for City. On June 11, 2013, Spain defeated the Republic of Ireland 2-0 in a friendly match at the stadium.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 21, 2014, it was announced that New York City FC, a Major League Soccer expansion team owned jointly by the New York Yankees and Manchester City, would play in Yankee Stadium from 2015 until their new stadium site is determined and the stadium is built.[15] NYCFC played their first game at Yankee Stadium on March 15, 2015. Because of the unique dimensions of the Yankee Stadium field, the playing surface of the soccer pitch is 110 yards (100 m) long by 70 yards (64 m) widethe smallest field in all of Major League Soccer, and the smallest allowed by FIFA's international guidelines.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Notre Dame Fighting Irish played a college football game at Yankee Stadium against The Army Black Knights on November 20, 2010, with the Irish defeating the Black Knights 27ÿ3. This marked the two teams' first meeting in the Bronx since 1969.[99] Army played Rutgers in 2011 (Rutgers defeated Army 27ÿ12),[100] and played against Connecticut in 2014.  Also in 2014, Lehigh and Lafayette played the 150th edition of their college football rivalry game at Yankee Stadium on November 22, 2014. Both teams played to a sold out stadium; Lafayette winning, 27-7. On November 12, 2016, Fordham University beat Holy Cross 54ÿ14 in the 53rd meeting of the RamÿCrusader Cup.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2010, Yankee Stadium has hosted the Pinstripe Bowl, an annual college football bowl game. The inaugural bowl pitted Syracuse (3rd place Big East) against Kansas State (7th place Big 12) on December 30, 2010. Syracuse defeated Kansas State 36ÿ34 in a shootout, before a crowd of 38,274.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stadium was intended to host a game between Rutgers and Maryland on November 4, 2017, but this event was cancelled in October 2017 due to potential conflicts with the Yankees' postseason.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first National Hockey League event took place on January 26, 2014, between the New York Rangers and the New Jersey Devils as part of the 2014 NHL Stadium Series. The Rangers also faced off against the New York Islanders on January 29, 2014, under the deep cold outdoor weather. The Rangers won both games, 7-3 and 2-1 respectively. Both games drew a little more than 50,000 spectators, almost the full capacity of the stadium. The Devils and Islanders never played an outdoor game before this series.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe promotional tour for the Manny PacquiaoÿMiguel Cotto fight began with an event at Yankee Stadium on September 10, 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 5, 2010, Yuri Foreman fought Cotto in the first boxing match in The Bronx since 1976. The fight was referred to as the \\"Stadium Slugfest\\". Cotto defeated Foreman with a TKO in the ninth round. Cotto captured the WBA super welterweight title and his fourth world title, before a crowd of 20,272.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first non-baseball event at the current version of Yankee Stadium took place on the evening of Saturday, April 25, 2009, when Senior Pastor Joel Osteen of Lakewood Church held what was dubbed as a \\"Historic Night of Hope\\" Christian prayer service.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nA New York University graduation ceremony took place on May 13, 2009 with the address being delivered by U.S. Secretary of State and former New York Senator Hillary Clinton. The 2010 NYU ceremony featured alumnus Alec Baldwin as a speaker.[110] President Bill Clinton spoke at the 2011 ceremony.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nEffective 2016, printed electronic tickets cannot be used at New York Yankees and New York City FC matches at Yankee Stadium. Only traditional hard-stock tickets, and those issued via a mobile ticketing system, are accepted. The team justified the decision by stating that it was meant to combat fraud associated with printed digital tickets. However, it was also believed that the team was trying to specifically hinder the ticket resale service StubHub, which competed against an official resale service run by TicketMaster known as the Yankees Ticket Exchange. The YTE is subject to a price flooring policy, meaning that tickets may only be discounted up to a certain amount. Although StubHub is the official ticket resale partner of Major League Baseball, the Yankees, as well as the Los Angeles Angels and Chicago Cubs, had opted out of this agreement.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nOwing to the Yankees' ownership of the team, New York City FC announced on March 11, 2016 that its matches would also be subject to this policy. At the team's March 13, 2016 home opener, although the team stated that they would be phasing in mobile ticketing by introducing additional verification steps for printed tickets before the policy takes full effect in April, reports indicated that the stadium was turning away fans with printed tickets, leading to long queue lines, as well as few attendees inside the stadium itself.[113][114] In an interview with WFAN radio, Yankees COO Lonn Trost explained that the measures were to help combat ticket resale, arguing that the team did not want fans to purchase \\"premium\\" seats at bargain prices, because they would be filled by \\"someone who has never sat in a premium location [before]\\".[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the April 3, 2016 episode of the HBO news-comedy series Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver responded to Trost's remarks, arguing that he was \\"saying that rich people couldn't bear to sit next to people who aren't as rich.\\" As a further satire of Trost's arguments against discounted resale, Oliver then announced a contest in which viewers were invited to send photos of themselves dressed as if they had \\"never sat in a premium location before\\", with winners offered the ability to purchase a pair of Legends Seats from one of the first three home games of the season for 25 cents. The stunt was successful, leading to the presence of several costumed attendees in Legends Seats during the opening games. Team president Randy Levine responded positively to the stunt, thanking Oliver for having bought tickets to begin with, and remarked that everyone was welcome at Yankee Stadium.[116][117][118]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 27, 2016, the Yankees announced that it had reached a deal with StubHub for it to become its new official ticket resale partner beginning on July 7, 2016, and allow season ticket holders to sell electronic tickets, rather than mail physical tickets to the buyer. The service will still be subject to a price flooring policy, but the team stated that the new arrangement would provide a \\"superior, more secure, [and] better experience\\".[119][120]","input":"When did they build the new yankee stadium?"},{"output":"Father Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles in Jingdezhen, China","context":"Industrial espionage, economic espionage, corporate spying or corporate espionage is a form of espionage conducted for commercial purposes instead of purely national security.[1] Economic espionage is conducted or orchestrated by governments and is international in scope, while industrial or corporate espionage is more often national and occurs between companies or corporations.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Competitive intelligence\\" describes the legal and ethical activity of systematically gathering, analyzing and managing information on industrial competitors.[3] It may include activities such as examining newspaper articles, corporate publications, websites, patent filings, specialised databases, information at trade shows and the like to determine information on a corporation.[4] The compilation of these crucial elements is sometimes termed CIS or CRS, a Competitive Intelligence Solution or Competitive Response Solution. With its roots in market research, \\"competitive intelligence\\" has been described as the \\"application of principles and practices from military and national intelligence to the domain of global business\\";[5] it is the business equivalent of open-source intelligence.\\r\\nThe difference between competitive intelligence and economic or industrial espionage is not clear; one needs to understand the legal basics to recognize how to draw the line between the two.[6][7] Others maintain it is sometimes quite difficult to tell the difference between legal and illegal methods, especially if considering the ethical side of information gathering, making the definition even more elusive.\\r\\nEconomic or industrial espionage takes place in two main forms. In short, the purpose of espionage is to gather knowledge about (an) organization(s). It may include the acquisition of intellectual property, such as information on industrial manufacture, ideas, techniques and processes, recipes and formulas. Or it could include sequestration of proprietary or operational information, such as that on customer datasets, pricing, sales, marketing, research and development, policies, prospective bids, planning or marketing strategies or the changing compositions and locations of production.[8] It may describe activities such as theft of trade secrets, bribery, blackmail and technological surveillance. As well as orchestrating espionage on commercial organizations, governments can also be targets  for example, to determine the terms of a tender for a government contract so that another tenderer can underbid.\\r\\nEconomic and industrial espionage is most commonly associated with technology-heavy industries, including computer software and hardware, biotechnology, aerospace, telecommunications, transportation and engine technology, automobiles, machine tools, energy, materials and coatings and so on. Silicon Valley is known to be one of the world's most targeted areas for espionage, though any industry with information of use to competitors may be a target.[9]\\r\\nInformation can make the difference between success and failure; if a trade secret is stolen, the competitive playing field is leveled or even tipped in favor of a competitor. Although a lot of information-gathering is accomplished legally through competitive intelligence, at times corporations feel the best way to get information is to take it.[10] Economic or industrial espionage is a threat to any business whose livelihood depends on information.\\r\\nIn recent years, economic or industrial espionage has taken on an expanded definition. For instance, attempts to sabotage a corporation may be considered industrial espionage; in this sense, the term takes on the wider connotations of its parent word. That espionage and sabotage (corporate or otherwise) have become more clearly associated with each other is also demonstrated by a number of profiling studies, some government, some corporate. The United States government currently has a polygraph examination entitled the \\"Test of Espionage and Sabotage\\" (TES), contributing to the increasingly popular, though not consensus, notion, by those studying espionage and sabotage countermeasures, of the interrelationship between the two.[11] In practice, particularly by \\"trusted insiders,\\" they are generally considered functionally identical for the purpose of informing countermeasures.\\r\\nEconomic or industrial espionage commonly occurs in one of two ways. Firstly, a dissatisfied employee appropriates information to advance interests or to damage the company. Secondly, a competitor or foreign government seeks information to advance its own technological or financial interest.[12] \\"Moles\\", or trusted insiders, are generally considered the best sources for economic or industrial espionage.[13] Historically known as a \\"patsy\\", an insider can be induced, willingly or under duress, to provide information. A patsy may be initially asked to hand over inconsequential information and, once compromised by committing a crime, bribed into handing over more sensitive material.[14] Individuals may leave one company to take up employment with another and take sensitive information with them.[15] Such apparent behavior has been the focus of numerous industrial espionage cases that have resulted in legal battles.[15] Some countries hire individuals to do spying rather than use of their own intelligence agencies.[16] Academics, business delegates, and students are often thought to be used by governments in gathering information.[17] Some countries, such as Japan, have been reported to expect students be debriefed on returning home.[17] A spy may follow a guided tour of a factory and then get \\"lost\\".[14] A spy could be an engineer, a maintenance man, a cleaner, an insurance salesman, or an inspector: anyone who has legitimate access to the premises.[14]\\r\\nA spy may break into the premises to steal data and may search through waste paper and refuse, known as \\"dumpster diving\\".[18] Information may be compromised via unsolicited requests for information, marketing surveys or use of technical support or research or software facilities. Outsourced industrial producers may ask for information outside the agreed-upon contract.[19]\\r\\nComputers have facilitated the process of collecting information because of the ease of access to large amounts of information through physical contact or the Internet.\\r\\nComputers have become key in exercising industrial espionage due to the enormous amount of information they contain and its ease of being copied and transmitted. The use of computers for espionage increased rapidly in the 1990s. Information has been commonly stolen by being copied from unattended computers in offices, those gaining unsupervised access doing so through subsidiary jobs, such as cleaners or repairmen. Laptops were, and still are, a prime target, with those traveling abroad on business being warned not to leave them for any period of time. Perpetrators of espionage have been known to find many ways of conning unsuspecting individuals into parting, often only temporarily, from their possessions, enabling others to access and steal information.[20] A \\"bag-op\\" refers to the use of hotel staff to access data, such as through laptops, in hotel rooms. Information may be stolen in transit, in taxis, at airport baggage counters, baggage carousels, on trains and so on.[18]\\r\\nThe rise of the internet and computer networks has expanded the range and detail of information available and the ease of access for the purpose of industrial espionage.[21] Worldwide, around 50,000 companies a day are thought to come under cyberattack with the rate estimated as doubling each year.[22] This type of operation is generally identified as state backed or sponsored, because the \\"access to personal, financial or analytic resources\\" identified exceed that which could be accessed by cybercriminals or individual hackers. Sensitive military or defense engineering or other industrial information may not have immediate monetary value to criminals, compared with, say, bank details. Analysis of cyberattacks suggests deep knowledge of networks, with targeted attacks, obtained by numerous individuals operating in a sustained organized way.[23]\\r\\nThe rising use of the internet has also extended opportunities for industrial espionage with the aim of sabotage. In the early 2000s, it was noticed that energy companies were increasingly coming under attack from hackers. Energy power systems, doing jobs like monitoring power grids or water flow, once isolated from the other computer networks, were now being connected to the internet, leaving them more vulnerable, having historically few built-in security features.[24] The use of these methods of industrial espionage have increasingly become a concern for governments, due to potential attacks by terrorist groups or hostile foreign governments.\\r\\nOne of the means of perpetrators conducting industrial espionage is by exploiting vulnerabilities in computer software. Malware and spyware as \\"a tool for industrial espionage\\", in \\"transmitting digital copies of trade secrets, customer plans, future plans and contacts\\". Newer forms of malware include devices which surreptitiously switch on mobile phones camera and recording devices. In attempts to tackle such attacks on their intellectual property, companies are increasingly keeping important information off network, leaving an \\"air gap\\", with some companies building \\"Faraday cages\\" to shield from electromagnetic or cellphone transmissions.[25]\\r\\nThe distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack uses compromised computer systems to orchestrate a flood of requests on the target system, causing it to shut down and deny service to other users.[26] It could potentially be used for economic or industrial espionage with the purpose of sabotage. This method was allegedly utilized by Russian secret services, over a period of two weeks on a cyberattack on Estonia in May 2007, in response to the removal of a Soviet era war memorial.[27]\\r\\nEconomic and industrial espionage has a long history. The work of Father Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles in Jingdezhen, China to reveal to Europe the manufacturing methods of Chinese porcelain in 1712 is sometimes considered an early case of industrial espionage.[28]\\r\\nHistorical accounts have been written of industrial espionage between Britain and France.[29] Attributed to Britain's emergence as an \\"industrial creditor\\", the second decade of the 18th century saw the emergence of a large-scale state-sponsored effort to surreptitiously take British industrial technology to France.[29] Witnesses confirmed both the inveigling of tradespersons abroad and the placing of apprentices in England.[30] Protests by those such as iron workers in Sheffield and steel workers in Newcastle,[clarification needed] about skilled industrial workers being enticed abroad, led to the first English legislation aimed at preventing this method of economic and industrial espionage.[31][30]\\r\\nEast-West commercial development opportunities after World War I saw a rise in Soviet interest in American and European manufacturing know-how, exploited by Amtorg Corporation.[32] Later, with Western restrictions on the export of items thought likely to increase military capabilities to the USSR, Soviet industrial espionage was a well known adjunct to other spying activities up until the 1980s.[33] BYTE reported in April 1984, for example, that although the Soviets sought to develop their own microelectronics, their technology appeared to be several years behind the West's. Soviet CPUs required multiple chips and appeared to be close or exact copies of American products such as the Intel 3000 and DEC LSI-11/2.[34]\\r\\nSome of these activities were directed via the East German Stasi (Ministry for State Security). One such operation, known as \\"Operation Brunnhilde\\" operated from the mid-1950s until early 1966 and made use of spies from many Communist Bloc countries. Through at least 20 forays, many western European industrial secrets were compromised.[35] One member of the \\"Brunnhilde\\" ring was a Swiss chemical engineer, Dr. Jean Paul Soupert (also known as \\"Air Bubble\\"), living in Brussels. He was described by Peter Wright in Spycatcher as having been \\"doubled\\" by the Belgian S?ret de l'tat.[35][36] He revealed information about industrial espionage conducted by the ring, including the fact that Russian agents had obtained details of Concorde's advanced electronics system.[37] He testified against two Kodak employees, living and working in Britain, during a trial in which they were accused of passing information on industrial processes to him, though they were eventually acquitted.[35]\\r\\nA secret report from the Military-Industrial Commission of the USSR (VPK), from 1979ÿ80, detailed how spetsinformatsiya (Russian: Ť쳶ҷѼ i.e. \\"special records\\") could be utilised in twelve different military industrial areas. Writing in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Philip Hanson detailed a spetsinformatsiya system in which 12 industrial branch ministries formulated requests for information to aid technological development in their military programs. Acquisition plans were described as operating on 2 year and 5 year cycles with about 3000 tasks under way each year. Efforts were aimed at civilian as well as military industrial targets, such as in the petrochemical industries. Some information was garnered so as to compare levels of competitor to Soviet technological advancement. Much unclassified information was also gathered, blurring the boundary with \\"competitive intelligence\\".[33]\\r\\nThe Soviet military was recognised as making much better use of acquired information, compared to civilian industry, where their record in replicating and developing industrial technology was poor.[33]\\r\\nFollowing the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, commentators, including the US Congressional Intelligence Committee, noted a redirection amongst the espionage community from military to industrial targets, with Western and former communist countries making use of \\"underemployed\\" spies and expanding programs directed at stealing such information.[38][39]\\r\\nThe legacy of Cold War spying included not just the redirection of personnel but the use of spying apparatus such as computer databases, scanners for eavesdropping, spy satellites, bugs and wires.[40]\\r\\nBetween 1987 and 1989, IBM and Texas Instruments were thought to have been targeted by French spies with the intention of helping France's Groupe Bull.[41] In 1993, U.S. aerospace companies were also thought to have been targeted by French interests.[42] During the early 1990s, France was described as one of the most aggressive pursuers of espionage to garner foreign industrial and technological secrets.[41] France accused the U.S. of attempting to sabotage its high tech industrial base.[41] The government of France has been alleged to have conducted ongoing industrial espionage against American aerodynamics and satellite companies.[43]\\r\\nIn 1993, car manufacturer Opel, the German division of General Motors, accused Volkswagen of industrial espionage after Opel's chief of production, Jose Ignacio Lopez, and seven other executives moved to Volkswagen.[15] Volkswagen subsequently threatened to sue for defamation, resulting in a four-year legal battle.[15] The case, which was finally settled in 1997, resulted in one of the largest settlements in the history of industrial espionage, with Volkswagen agreeing to pay General Motors $100 million and to buy at least $1 billion of car parts from the company over 7 years, although it did not explicitly apologize for Lopez's behavior.[44]\\r\\nIn April 2009 the US based hospitality company Starwood accused its rival Hilton of a \\"massive\\" case of industrial espionage. After being purchased by private equity group Blackstone, Hilton employed 10 managers and executives from Starwood. Under intense pressure to improve profits,[clarification needed] Starwood accused Hilton of stealing corporate information relating to its luxury brand concepts, used in setting up its own Denizen hotels. Specifically, former head of its luxury brands group, Ron Klein, was accused of downloading \\"truckloads of documents\\" from a laptop to his personal email account.[45]\\r\\nGhostNet was a \\"vast surveillance system\\" reported by Canadian researchers based at the University of Toronto in March 2009. Using targeted emails it compromised thousands of computers in governmental organisations, enabling attackers to scan for information and transfer this back to a \\"digital storage facility in China\\".[46]\\r\\nOn 13 January 2010, Google Inc. announced that operators, from within China, had hacked into their Google China operation, stealing intellectual property and, in particular, accessing the email accounts of human rights activists.[47][48] The attack was thought to have been part of a more widespread cyber attack on companies within China which has become known as Operation Aurora.[48] Intruders were thought to have launched a zero-day attack, exploiting a weakness in the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser, the malware used being a modification of the trojan \\"Hydraq\\".[25] Concerned about the possibility of hackers taking advantage of this previously unknown weakness in Internet Explorer, the governments of Germany and, subsequently France, issued warnings not to use the browser.[49]\\r\\nThere was speculation that \\"insiders\\" had been involved in the attack, with some Google China employees being denied access to the company's internal networks after the company's announcement.[50][51] In February 2010, computer experts from the U.S. National Security Agency claimed that the attacks on Google probably originated from two Chinese universities associated with expertise in computer science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Shandong Lanxiang Vocational School, the latter having close links to the Chinese military.[46]\\r\\nGoogle claimed at least 20 other companies had also been targeted in the cyber attack, said by the London Times, to have been part of an \\"ambitious and sophisticated attempt to steal secrets from unwitting corporate victims\\" including \\"defence contractors, finance and technology companies\\".[48][47][49] Rather than being the work of individuals or organised criminals, the level of sophistication of the attack was thought to have been \\"more typical of a nation state\\".[47] Some commentators speculated as to whether the attack was part of what is thought to be a concerted Chinese industrial espionage operation aimed at getting \\"high-tech information to jump-start China's economy\\".[52] Critics pointed to what was alleged to be a lax attitude to the intellectual property of foreign businesses in China, letting them operate but then seeking to copy or reverse engineer their technology for the benefit of Chinese \\"national champions\\".[53] In Google's case, they may have (also) been concerned about the possible misappropriation of source code or other technology for the benefit of Chinese rival Baidu. In March 2010 Google subsequently decided to cease offering censored results in China, leading to the closing of its Chinese operation.\\r\\nThe US based firm CyberSitter announced in January 2010 that it was suing the Chinese government, and other US companies, for stealing its anti pornography software, with the accusation that it had been incorporated into China's Green Dam program, used by the state to censor children's internet access. CyberSitter accused Green Dam creators as having copied around 3000 lines of code. They were described as having done 'a sloppy job of copying,' with some lines of the copied code continuing to direct people to the CyberSitter website. The attorney acting for CyberSitter maintained \\"I don't think I have ever seen such clear-cut stealing\\".[54]\\r\\nThe United States charged two former NetLogic Inc. engineers, Lan Lee and Yuefei Ge, of committing economic espionage against TSMC and NetLogic, Inc. A jury acquitted the defendants of the charges with regard to TSMC and deadlocked on the charges with regard to NetLogic. In May 2010, a federal judge dismissed all the espionage charges against the two defendants. The judge ruled that the U.S. Government presented no evidence of espionage.[55]\\r\\nIn May 2010, the federal jury convicted Chordiant Software, Inc., a U.S. corporation, of stealing Dongxiao Yue's JRPC technologies and used them in a product called Chordiant Marketing Director. Yue previously filed lawsuits against Symantec Corporation for a similar theft.[56]\\r\\nRevelations from the Snowden documents have provided information to the effect that the United States, notably vis--vis the NSA, has been conducting aggressive economic espionage against Brazil.[57] Canadian intelligence has apparently supported U.S. economic espionage efforts.[58]\\r\\nAccording to Edward Snowden, The National Security Agency spies on foreign companies.[59] A recent report to the US government, by aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman, describes Chinese economic espionage as comprising \\"the single greatest threat to U.S. technology\\".[23] Joe Stewart, of SecureWorks, blogging on the 2009 cyber attack on Google, referred to a \\"persistent campaign of 'espionage-by-malware' emanating from the Peoples Republic of China (PRC)\\" with both corporate and state secrets being \\"Shanghaied\\" over the past 5 or 6 years.[60] The Northrop Grumann report states that the collection of US defense engineering data through cyberattack is regarded as having \\"saved the recipient of the information years of R&D and significant amounts of funding\\".[23] Concerns about the extent of cyberattacks on the US emanating from China has led to the situation being described as the dawn of a \\"new cold cyberwar\\".[61] In response to these and other reports, Amitai Etzioni of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies has suggested that China and the United States should agree to a policy of mutually assured restraint with respect to cyberspace. This would involve allowing both states to take the measures they deem necessary for their self-defense while simultaneously agreeing to refrain from taking offensive steps; it would also entail vetting these commitments.[62] In June 2015 Wikileaks published documents over National Security Agency spied French companies.[63]\\r\\nIn December 2007, it was revealed that Jonathan Evans, head of the United Kingdom's MI5, had sent out confidential letters to 300 chief executives and security chiefs at the country's banks, accountants and legal firms warning of attacks from Chinese 'state organisations'.[64] A summary was also posted on the secure website of the Centre for the Protection of the National Infrastructure, accessed by some of the nation's 'critical infrastructure' companies, including 'telecoms firms, banks and water and electricity companies'.[65] One security expert warned about the use of 'custom trojans,' software specifically designed to hack into a particular firm and feed back data.[65] Whilst China was identified as the country most active in the use of internet spying, up to 120 other countries were said to be using similar techniques.[65] The Chinese government responded to UK accusations of economic espionage by saying that the report of such activities was 'slanderous' and that the government opposed hacking which is prohibited by law.[66]\\r\\nGerman counter-intelligence experts have maintained the German economy is losing around ?53 billion or the equivalent of 30,000 jobs to economic espionage yearly.[67]\\r\\nIn Operation Eikonal German BND agents received \\"selector lists\\" from the NSA ÿ search terms for their dragnet surveillance. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets.[68] These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the Eurocopter project[69] as well as French administration,[70][68] which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005.[69] After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks.[68] After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the Left Party and the Greens filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.[68][71]\\r\\nThe BND's project group charged with supporting the NSA investigative committee in German parliament set up in spring 2014, reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated economic espionage directly under the Germans' noses.[68][72] The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court - instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, Kurt Graulich, as a \\"person of trust\\" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters.[73][74] In his almost 300-paged report[75] Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz) ? including numerous enterprises based in Germany ÿ were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude.[76]","input":"Who was considered to be the first industrial spy?"},{"output":"East High School","context":"High School Musical is a 2006 American musical television film and the first installment in the High School Musical trilogy directed by Kenny Ortega.

On December 29, 2006, it became the first DCOM to be broadcast on the BBC.[8] Globally, High School Musical has been seen by over 225 million viewers.[9][10]\\r\\nWith a plot described by the author and numerous critics as a modern adaptation of Romeo & Juliet,[11] High School Musical is a story about two high school juniors from rival cliques ÿ Troy Bolton (Zac Efron), captain of the basketball team, and Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens), a shy transfer student who excels in mathematics and science.[12] Together, they try out for the lead parts in their high school musical, and this causes division among all the school's students. Despite other students' attempts to thwart their dreams, Troy and Gabriella resist peer pressure and rivalry, inspiring others along the way not to \\"stick to the status quo\\". High school diva Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) and her twin brother Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), will do anything not only to sabotage the friendship and romance between Troy and Gabriella, but also to get the leads in the school musical.\\r\\nHigh School Musical was filmed at East High School located in Salt Lake City, Utah, the auditorium of Murray High School, and Downtown Salt Lake City. Murray High School was also the set of several other Disney productions: Take Down (1979), Read It and Weep (2006), Minutemen (2008),[13] and High School Musical: Get in the Picture (2008).[14] In January 2016, cast members Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, Corbin Bleu, and Monique Coleman reunited in a Los Angeles high school gym (decorated to resemble the gym used in the film) to celebrate the film's tenth anniversary. Zac Efron was unable to attend but instead sent in a short video of himself giving acknowledgments toward the cast, crew, and fans of the film.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn New Year's Eve, high school juniors Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) and Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) meet at a party while both teens are at a ski lodge during winter break. At the party, the two are called upon to sing karaoke together (\\"Start of Something New\\"). They find that they have a connection and decide to exchange numbers before going their separate ways.\\r\\nOn the first day back at school after Christmas break, Troy sees Gabriella in his classroom and she explains that she just moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and transferred to East High School over the break. Troy then shows Gabriella around school. Drama Club president Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) arrives and assumes that Gabriella is interested in auditioning. Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay investigates the new girl and has the scholastic decathlon captain and Chem Club president, Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman), find out about Gabriella's past academic achievements, which results in her and Gabriella becoming great friends.\\r\\nDuring basketball practice, Troy has trouble focusing because his thoughts are on Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing in addition to basketball (\\"Get'cha Head in the Game\\"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform (\\"What I've Been Looking For\\"), but Troy and Gabriella are both too shy to audition. When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward once the auditions are unofficially \\"over\\", Troy offers to sing with her, but drama teacher Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) tells them that they are too late and leaves. Kelsi Nielsen (Olesya Rulin), the musical's composer, trips and drops her music all over the stage. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her, and they sing together as Kelsi plays piano (\\"What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)\\"). Ms. Darbus overhears them and gives them a callback audition.\\r\\nWhen the callback list is posted, Sharpay discovers that she has competition for the lead in the musical, and the rest of the Wildcats are shocked that Troy has auditioned. Other students confess their own secret passions and talents (\\"Stick to the Status Quo\\"), alarming Taylor and Troy's best friend Chad Danforth (Corbin Bleu). Since Gabriella has agreed to join the scholastic decathlon team, both Taylor and Chad want their teammates to focus on their upcoming competitions rather than the musical. In the locker room, Troy is tricked by his teammates into saying that Gabriella is not important while she watches through a video conference that the scholastic decathlon team had set up through a hidden webcam in cahoots with the basketballers. Gabriella gets extremely upset by his betrayal (\\"When There Was Me and You\\") and decides not to audition for the musical.\\r\\nTroy is left confused as to why Gabriella did not want to audition anymore and is unable to concentrate on the game. Gabriella is also seen to be in low spirits. Realizing their mistake, Chad and the basketball team tell Troy what happened and offer to support him in callbacks. Troy goes to Gabriella's house and they reconcile.\\r\\nAfter overhearing Gabriella and Troy practicing, Sharpay has Ms. Darbus change the callback time to coincide with both the basketball championship and the scholastic decathlon to interfere with Gabriella and Troy's participation. Kelsi overhears the conversation and the basketball team and the decathlon team work together to come up with a plan. On the day of the competitions, Taylor and Gabriella use the school's computers to delay the championship game and the decathlon, by messing with the power in the gym and causing a chemical reaction that forces an evacuation. Troy and Gabriella rush to the auditorium while Sharpay and Ryan finish performing their callback song (\\"Bop to the Top\\"), confident that their plan worked. After Gabriella and Troy audition (\\"Breaking Free\\"), Ms. Darbus gives the two the lead roles, making Sharpay and Ryan understudies.\\r\\nBoth teams win their respective competitions and the entire school gathers in the gym to celebrate (\\"We're All In This Together\\"). Chad asks Taylor out, and Sharpay makes peace with Gabriella.\\r\\nIn a post-credits scene, Zeke Baylor (Chris Warren Jr.) paces alone in the gym as Sharpay runs in declaring the cookies she rejected from him earlier \\"genius\\". She then hugs him and he says he will make her a crme br?le. Zeke smiles in victory.\\r\\nThe soundtrack was released on January 10, 2006, and debuted at number 133 on the Billboard 200, selling 7,469 copies in its first week.

It has hosted the sport during two Olympics and is still in use today.\\r\\nInternational bobsleigh competitions are governed by the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, also known as FIBT from the French Fdration Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing. National competitions are often governed by bodies such as the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation and Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name is derived from the action some early competitors adopted of bobbing back and forth inside their sleds to increase speed.[1]\\r\\nAlthough sledding on snow or ice had been popular in many northern countries, the origins of bobsleighing as a modern sport are relatively recent. Its foundation began when hotelier Caspar Badrutt (1848ÿ1904) managed to convince some English tourists to stay at his hotel in the mineral spa town of St. Moritz, Switzerland through the entire winter. He successfully sold the idea of \\"winter resorting\\" to his English regulars with food, alcohol and activities. Badrutt took this action because he had been annoyed by his regular guests were only staying at his hotel during the summer months. Within a couple of years, wintering in St Moritz at Badrutt's hotel became very fashionable. But increased numbers led those who were staying to search for new diversions. In the early 1870s some adventurous English guests began adapting boys' delivery sleds for recreational purposes and began colliding with pedestrians while speeding down the lanes, alleys and roads in St Moritz.\\r\\nGuests soon began to invent \\"steering means\\" for the sleds. This led to the development of the bobsleigh (bobsled): two cresta's (skeleton sleds) attached together with a board that had a steering mechanism at the front. However, the impetus to steer the sleds permitted longer runs through the town. Longer runs also meant higher speeds on curves. Local sentiments varied about these informal competitions but eventually complaints grew so vociferous that Badrutt was forced to take action. He built the first natural ice run for his guests because he had worked hard to popularize wintering in the mountain resort and was worried customers would stop coming due to boredom. He also did not want to make enemies in the town from locals injured by bobsled accidents. He opened the world's first natural ice half-pipe track in the late 1870s.\\r\\nFormal competitions started down the natural ice Cresta Run in 1884, which was built in partnership between guests and local people. The run, which is still in operation as of 2014[update], has served as a host track for skeleton at two Winter Olympics (1928 and 1948). As one of the few natural weather tracks in the world, it does not use artificial refrigeration. It is not known how much the original track evolved in the early years as the three sports matured and stabilized. The first club formed in 1897, and the first purpose-built track solely for bobsleds opened in 1902 outside St Moritz. Over the years, bobsleigh tracks evolved from straight runs to twisting and turning tracks. The original wooden sleds[2] gave way to streamlined fiberglass and metal ones.\\r\\nThe International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (FIBT) was founded in 1923. Men's four-man bobsleigh appeared in the first ever Winter Olympic Games in 1924, and the men's two-man bobsleigh event was added in 1932. Though not included in the 1960 Winter Olympics, bobsleigh has featured in every Winter Olympics since. Women's bobsleigh competition began in the US in 1983 with two demonstration races in Lake Placid, New York, one held in February and the second held during the World Cup races in March 1983. Women's two-woman bobsleigh made its Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Bobsleigh is also contested at American, European, and World Cup championships.\\r\\nGermany and Switzerland have proven the most successful bobsleighing nations measured by overall success in European, World, World Cup, and Olympic championships. Since the 1990s Germans have dominated in international competition, having won more medals than any other nation. Italy, Austria, United States and Canada also have strong bobsleigh traditions.\\r\\nBobsleighs can attain speeds of 150?km/h (93?mph), with the reported world record being 201?km/h (125?mph).[3]\\r\\nModern tracks are made of concrete, coated with ice. They are required to have at least one straight section and one labyrinth (three turns in quick succession without a straight section). Ideally, a modern track should be 1,200?to 1,300 metres (3,900ÿ4,300?ft) long and have at least fifteen curves. Speeds may exceed 120 kilometres per hour (75?mph), and some curves can subject the crews to as much as 5 g.\\r\\nSome bobsleigh tracks are also used for luge and skeleton competition.\\r\\nSome tracks offer tourists rides in bobsleighs, including those at Sigulda, Latvia; Innsbruck-Igls, Austria; Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Whistler, British Columbia, Canada; Lillehammer, Norway; Cesana Pariol, Italy; Lake Placid, US; Salt Lake City, Utah, US and La Plagne, France.\\r\\nModern day sleighs combine light metals, steel runners, and an aerodynamic composite body. Competition sleighs must be a maximum of 3.80 metres (12.5?ft) long (4-crew) or 2.70 metres (8.9?ft) long (2-crew). The runners on both are set at 0.67 metres (2.2?ft) gauge. Until the weight-limit rule was added in 1952, bobsleigh crews tended to be very heavy to ensure the greatest possible speed. Nowadays, the maximum weight, including crew, is 630 kilograms (1,390?lb) (4-man), 390 kilograms (860?lb) (2-man), or 340 kilograms (750?lb) (2-woman), which can be reached via the addition of metal weights. The bobsleighs themselves are designed to be as light as possible to allow dynamic positioning of mass through the turns of the bobsleigh course.[4]\\r\\nBobsleigh crews once consisted of five or six people, but were reduced to two- and four-person sleighs in the 1930s. A crew is made up of a pilot, a brakeman, and, only in 4-man heats, two pushers. Athletes are selected based on their speed and strength, which are necessary to push the sleigh to a competitive speed at the start of the race. Pilots must have the skill, timing, and finesse to steer the sleigh along the path, or, 'line', that will produce the greatest speed.\\r\\nIn modern bobsleighs, the steering system consists of two metal rings that actuate a pulley system located in the forward cowling that turns the front runners. For example, to turn left, the pilot would pull the left ring. Only subtle steering adjustments are necessary to guide the sled; at speeds up to 80 miles per hour (130?km/h), anything larger would result in a crash. The pilot does most of the steering, and the brakeman stops the sled after crossing the finish line by pulling the sled's brake lever.\\r\\nWomen compete in Women's Bobsleigh (which is always two-woman), and men in both two and four-man competitions.[5] Women were confirmed as being able to compete in any four-'man' bobsleigh event, as from 25 September 2014, either as part of a mixed-sex team or an all-female team.\\r\\nIndividual runs down the course, or \\"heats\\", begin from a standing start, with the crew pushing the sled for up to 50 metres (160?ft) before boarding; though the pilot does not steer, grooves in the ice make steering unnecessary until the sled leaves the starting area. While poor form during the initial push can lose a team the heat, it is otherwise rarely, if ever, decisive. Over the rest of the course, a sleigh's speed depends on its weight, aerodynamics, runners, the condition of the ice, and the skill of the pilot.\\r\\nRace times are recorded in hundredths of seconds, so even seemingly minor errors ÿ especially those at the beginning, which affect the remainder of the heat ÿ can have a measurable impact on the final race standings.\\r\\nThe men's and women's standings for normal races are calculated over the aggregate of two runs or heats. At the Olympic Winter Games and World Championships, all competitions (for both men and women) consist of four heats.\\r\\nCurrent Olympic champion: 01 ! ?Russia?(RUS) 02 ! ?Latvia?(LAT) 03 ! ?United States?(USA)\\r\\nCurrent Olympic champion: 01 ! ?Germany?(GER) 01 ! ?Canada?(CAN) 03 ! ?Latvia?(LAT)\\r\\nCurrent Olympic champion: 01 ! ?Canada?(CAN) 02 ! ?United States?(USA)-1 03 ! ?United States?(USA)-2","input":"Where was the world's first bobsleigh track built?"},{"output":"thirty-six miles","context":"Hockley is an unincorporated community located in Harris County, Texas on Texas State Highway 6 and U.S. Highway 290, approximately five miles southeast of the city hall of Waller, and thirty-six miles northwest of Downtown Houston.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe community serves as the main hub for railway traffic serving Houston, Austin, and many parts of central Texas.

It is mostly made of molecular hydrogen and helium in roughly solar proportions; other chemical compounds are present only in small amounts and include methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and water. Although water is thought to reside deep in the atmosphere, its directly measured concentration is very low. The nitrogen, sulfur, and noble gas abundances in Jupiter's atmosphere exceed solar values by a factor of about three.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter lacks a clear lower boundary and gradually transitions into the liquid interior of the planet.[3] From lowest to highest, the atmospheric layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, thermosphere and exosphere.  Each layer has characteristic temperature gradients.[4] The lowest layer, the troposphere, has a complicated system of clouds and hazes, comprising layers of ammonia, ammonium hydrosulfide and water.[5] The upper ammonia clouds visible at Jupiter's surface are organized in a dozen zonal bands parallel to the equator and are bounded by powerful zonal atmospheric flows (winds) known as jets. The bands alternate in color: the dark bands are called belts, while light ones are called zones. Zones, which are colder than belts, correspond to upwellings, while belts mark descending gas.[6]  The zones' lighter color is believed to result from ammonia ice; what gives the belts their darker colors is uncertain.[6]  The origins of the banded structure and jets are not well understood, though a \\"shallow model\\" and a \\"deep model\\" exist.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jovian atmosphere shows a wide range of active phenomena, including band instabilities, vortices (cyclones and anticyclones), storms and lightning.[8] The vortices reveal themselves as large red, white or brown spots (ovals). The largest two spots are the Great Red Spot (GRS)[9] and Oval BA,[10] which is also red. These two and most of the other large spots are anticyclonic.  Smaller anticyclones tend to be white.  Vortices are thought to be relatively shallow structures with depths not exceeding several hundred kilometers. Located in the southern hemisphere, the GRS is the largest known vortex in the Solar System. It could engulf two or three Earths and has existed for at least three hundred years. Oval BA, south of GRS, is a red spot a third the size of GRS that formed in 2000 from the merging of three white ovals.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nJupiter has powerful storms, often accompanied by lightning strikes. The storms are a result of moist convection in the atmosphere connected to the evaporation and condensation of water. They are sites of strong upward motion of the air, which leads to the formation of bright and dense clouds. The storms form mainly in belt regions. The lightning strikes on Jupiter are hundreds of times more powerful than those seen on Earth, and are assumed to be associated with the water clouds.[12] This storm near the red spot is called Red Spot Junior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter is classified into four layers, by increasing altitude: the troposphere, stratosphere, thermosphere and exosphere. Unlike the Earth's atmosphere, Jupiter's lacks a mesosphere.[13] Jupiter does not have a solid surface, and the lowest atmospheric layer, the troposphere, smoothly transitions into the planet's fluid interior.[3] This is a result of having temperatures and the pressures well above those of the critical points for hydrogen and helium, meaning that there is no sharp boundary between gas and liquid phases. Hydrogen becomes a supercritical fluid at a pressure of around 12 bar.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the lower boundary of the atmosphere is ill-defined, the pressure level of 10?bars, at an altitude of about 90?km below 1?bar  with a temperature of around 340?K, is commonly treated as the base of the troposphere.[4] In scientific literature, the 1?bar pressure level is usually chosen as a zero point for altitudesa \\"surface\\" of Jupiter.[3] As with Earth, the top atmospheric layer, the exosphere, does not have a well defined upper boundary.[14] The density gradually decreases until it smoothly transitions into the interplanetary medium approximately 5,000?km above the \\"surface\\".[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vertical temperature gradients in the Jovian atmosphere are similar to those of the atmosphere of Earth. The temperature of the troposphere decreases with height until it reaches a minimum at the tropopause,[16] which is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere. On Jupiter, the tropopause is approximately 50?km above the visible clouds (or 1?bar level), where the pressure and temperature are about 0.1?bar and 110?K.[4][17] In the stratosphere, the temperatures rise to about 200?K at the transition into the thermosphere, at an altitude and pressure of around 320?km and 1?bar.[4] In the thermosphere, temperatures continue to rise, eventually reaching 1000?K at about 1000?km, where pressure is about 1?nbar.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nJupiter's troposphere contains a complicated cloud structure.[19] The upper clouds, located in the pressure range 0.6ÿ0.9?bar, are made of ammonia ice.[20] Below these ammonia ice clouds, denser clouds made of ammonium hydrosulfide ((NH4)SH)  or ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S, between 1ÿ2?bar) and water (3ÿ7?bar) are thought to exist.[21][22] There are no methane clouds as the temperatures are too high for it to condense.[19] The water clouds form the densest layer of clouds and have the strongest influence on the dynamics of the atmosphere. This is a result of the higher condensation heat of water and higher water abundance as compared to the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide (oxygen is a more abundant chemical element than either nitrogen or sulfur).[13] Various tropospheric (at 200ÿ500?mbar) and stratospheric (at 10ÿ100?mbar) haze layers reside above the main cloud layers.[21][23] The latter are made from condensed heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or hydrazine, which are generated in the upper stratosphere (1ÿ100?bar) from methane under the influence of the solar ultraviolet radiation (UV).[19] The methane abundance relative to molecular hydrogen in the stratosphere is about 10?4,[15] while the abundance ratio of other light hydrocarbons, like ethane and acetylene, to molecular hydrogen is about 10?6.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nJupiter's thermosphere is located at pressures lower than 1?bar and demonstrates such phenomena as airglow, polar aurorae and X-ray emissions.[24] Within it lie layers of increased electron and ion density that form the ionosphere.[15] The high temperatures prevalent in the thermosphere (800ÿ1000 K) have not been fully explained yet;[18] existing models predict a temperature no higher than about 400?K.[15] They may be caused by absorption of high-energy solar radiation (UV or X-ray), by heating from the charged particles precipitating from the Jovian magnetosphere, or by dissipation of upward-propagating gravity waves.[25] The thermosphere and exosphere at the poles and at low latitudes emit X-rays, which were first observed by the Einstein Observatory in 1983.[26] The energetic particles coming from Jupiter's magnetosphere create bright auroral ovals, which encircle the poles. Unlike their terrestrial analogs, which appear only during magnetic storms, aurorae are permanent features of Jupiter's atmosphere.[26] The thermosphere was the first place outside the Earth where the trihydrogen cation (H+3) was discovered.[15] This ion emits strongly in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum, at wavelengths between 3 and 5?m; this is the main cooling mechanism of the thermosphere.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\n3.2?I?1.4 (9ÿ12?bar)\\r\\n\\r\\n0.19ÿ0.58 (19?bar)\\r\\n\\r\\n(0.08ÿ2.8?bar)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is similar to that of the planet as a whole.[2] Jupiter's atmosphere is the most comprehensively understood of those of all the gas giants because it was observed directly by the Galileo atmospheric probe when it entered the Jovian atmosphere on December 7, 1995.[27] Other sources of information about Jupiter's atmospheric composition include the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO),[28] the Galileo and Cassini orbiters,[29] and Earth-based observations.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two main constituents of the Jovian atmosphere are molecular hydrogen (H2) and helium.[2] The helium abundance is 0.157 I 0.004 relative to molecular hydrogen by number of molecules, and its mass fraction is 0.234 I 0.005, which is slightly lower than the Solar System's primordial value.[2] The reason for this low abundance is not entirely understood, but some of the helium may have condensed into the core of Jupiter.[20] This condensation is likely to be in the form of helium rain: as hydrogen turns into the metallic state at depths of more than 10,000?km, helium separates from it forming droplets which, being denser than the metallic hydrogen, descend towards the core. This can also explain the severe depletion of neon (see Table), an element that easily dissolves in helium droplets and would be transported in them towards the core as well.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atmosphere contains various simple compounds such as water, methane (CH4), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3) and phosphine (PH3).[2] Their abundances in the deep (below 10?bar) troposphere imply that the atmosphere of Jupiter is enriched in the elements carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and possibly oxygen[b] by factor of 2ÿ4 relative to the Sun.[c][2] The noble gases argon, krypton and xenon also appear in abundance relative to solar levels (see table), while neon is scarcer.[2] Other chemical compounds such as arsine (AsH3) and germane (GeH4) are present only in trace amounts.[2] The upper atmosphere of Jupiter contains small amounts of simple hydrocarbons such as ethane, acetylene, and diacetylene, which form from methane under the influence of the solar ultraviolet radiation and charged particles coming from Jupiter's magnetosphere.[2] The carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water present in the upper atmosphere are thought to originate from impacting comets, such as Shoemaker-Levy 9. The water cannot come from the troposphere because the cold tropopause acts like a cold trap, effectively preventing water from rising to the stratosphere (see Vertical structure above).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarth-?and spacecraft-based measurements have led to improved knowledge of the isotopic ratios in Jupiter's atmosphere. As of July 2003, the accepted value for the deuterium abundance is (2.25 I 0.35)?G?10?5,[2] which probably represents the primordial value in the protosolar nebula that gave birth to the Solar System.[28] The ratio of nitrogen isotopes in the Jovian atmosphere, 15N to 14N, is 2.3?G?10?3, a third lower than that in the Earth's atmosphere (3.5?G?10?3).[2] The latter discovery is especially significant since the previous theories of Solar System formation considered the terrestrial value for the ratio of nitrogen isotopes to be primordial.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visible surface of Jupiter is divided into several bands parallel to the equator. There are two types of bands: lightly colored zones and relatively dark belts.[6] The wider Equatorial Zone (EZ) extends between latitudes of approximately 7S to 7N. Above and below the EZ, the North and South Equatorial belts (NEB and SEB) extend to 18N and 18S, respectively. Farther from the equator lie the North and South Tropical zones (NtrZ and STrZ).[6] The alternating pattern of belts and zones continues until the polar regions at approximately 50?degrees latitude, where their visible appearance becomes somewhat muted.[31] The basic belt-zone structure probably extends well towards the poles, reaching at least to 80 North or South.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difference in the appearance between zones and belts is caused by differences in the opacity of the clouds. Ammonia concentration is higher in zones, which leads to the appearance of denser clouds of ammonia ice at higher altitudes, which in turn leads to their lighter color.[16] On the other hand, in belts clouds are thinner and are located at lower altitudes.[16] The upper troposphere is colder in zones and warmer in belts.[6] The exact nature of chemicals that make Jovian zones and bands so colorful is not known, but they may include complicated compounds of sulfur, phosphorus and carbon.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jovian bands are bounded by zonal atmospheric flows (winds), called jets. The eastward (prograde) jets are found at the transition from zones to belts (going away from the equator), whereas westward (retrograde) jets mark the transition from belts to zones.[6] Such flow velocity patterns mean that the zonal winds decrease in belts and increase in zones from the equator to the pole. Therefore, wind shear in belts is cyclonic, while in zones it is anticyclonic.[22] The EZ is an exception to this rule, showing a strong eastward (prograde) jet and has a local minimum of the wind speed exactly at the equator. The jet speeds are high on Jupiter, reaching more than 100?m/s.[6] These speeds correspond to ammonia clouds located in the pressure range 0.7ÿ1?bar. The prograde jets are generally more powerful than the retrograde jets.[6] The vertical extent of jets is not known. They decay over two to three scale heights[a] above the clouds, while below the cloud level, winds increase slightly and then remain constant down to at least 22?barthe maximum operational depth reached by the Galileo Probe.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of Jupiter's banded structure is not completely clear, though it may be similar to that driving the Earth's Hadley cells. The simplest interpretation is that zones are sites of atmospheric upwelling, whereas belts are manifestations of downwelling.[32] When air enriched in ammonia rises in zones, it expands and cools, forming high and dense clouds. In belts, however, the air descends, warming adiabatically as in a convergence zone on Earth, and white ammonia clouds evaporate, revealing lower, darker clouds. The location and width of bands, speed and location of jets on Jupiter are remarkably stable, having changed only slightly between 1980 and 2000. One example of change is a decrease of the speed of the strongest eastward jet located at the boundary between the North Tropical zone and North Temperate belts at 23N.[7][32] However bands vary in coloration and intensity over time (see below).  These variations were first observed in the early seventeenth century.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe belts and zones that divide Jupiter's atmosphere each have their own names and unique characteristics. They begin below the North and South Polar Regions, which extend from the poles to roughly 40ÿ48 N/S. These bluish-gray regions are usually featureless.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North North Temperate Region rarely shows more detail than the polar regions, due to limb darkening, foreshortening, and the general diffuseness of features. However, the North-North Temperate Belt (NNTB) is the northernmost distinct belt, though it occasionally disappears. Disturbances tend to be minor and short-lived. The North-North Temperate Zone (NNTZ) is perhaps more prominent, but also generally quiet. Other minor belts and zones in the region are occasionally observed.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North Temperate Region is part of a latitudinal region easily observable from Earth, and thus has a superb record of observation.[35] It also features the strongest prograde jet stream on the planeta westerly current that forms the southern boundary of the North Temperate Belt (NTB).[35] The NTB fades roughly once a decade (this was the case during the Voyager encounters), making the North Temperate Zone (NTZ) apparently merge into the North Tropical Zone (NTropZ).[35] Other times, the NTZ is divided by a narrow belt into northern and southern components.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North Tropical Region is composed of the NTropZ and the North Equatorial Belt (NEB). The NTropZ is generally stable in coloration, changing in tint only in tandem with activity on the NTB's southern jet stream. Like the NTZ, it too is sometimes divided by a narrow band, the NTropB. On rare occasions, the southern NTropZ plays host to \\"Little Red Spots\\". As the name suggests, these are northern equivalents of the Great Red Spot. Unlike the GRS, they tend to occur in pairs and are always short-lived, lasting a year on average; one was present during the Pioneer 10 encounter.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NEB is one of the most active belts on the planet. It is characterized by anticyclonic white ovals and cyclonic \\"barges\\" (also known as \\"brown ovals\\"), with the former usually forming farther north than the latter; as in the NTropZ, most of these features are relatively short-lived. Like the South Equatorial Belt (SEB), the NEB has sometimes dramatically faded and \\"revived\\". The timescale of these changes is about 25 years.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Equatorial Region (EZ) is one of the most stable regions of the planet, in latitude and in activity. The northern edge of the EZ hosts spectacular plumes that trail southwest from the NEB, which are bounded by dark, warm (in infrared) features known as festoons (hot spots).[38] Though the southern boundary of the EZ is usually quiescent, observations from the late 19th into the early 20th century show that this pattern was then reversed relative to today. The EZ varies considerably in coloration, from pale to an ochre, or even coppery hue; it is occasionally divided by an Equatorial Band (EB).[39] Features in the EZ move roughly 390?km/h relative to the other latitudes.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Tropical Region includes the South Equatorial Belt (SEB) and the South Tropical Zone. It is by far the most active region the planet, as it is home to its strongest retrograde jet stream. The SEB is usually the broadest, darkest belt on Jupiter; it is sometimes split by a zone (the SEBZ), and can fade entirely every 3 to 15 years before reappearing in what is known as an SEB Revival cycle. A period of weeks or months following the belt's disappearance, a white spot forms and erupts dark brownish material which is stretched into a new belt by Jupiter's winds. The belt most recently disappeared in May 2010.[42]  Another characteristic of the SEB is a long train of cyclonic disturbances following the Great Red Spot. Like the NTropZ, the STropZ is one of the most prominent zones on the planet; not only does it contain the GRS, but it is occasionally rent by a South Tropical Disturbance (STropD), a division of the zone that can be very long-lived; the most famous one lasted from 1901 to 1939.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Temperate Region, or South Temperate Belt (STB), is yet another dark, prominent belt, more so than the NTB; until March 2000, its most famous features were the long-lived white ovals BC, DE, and FA, which have since merged to form Oval BA (\\"Red Jr.\\"). The ovals were part of South Temperate Zone, but they extended into STB partially blocking it.[6] The STB has occasionally faded, apparently due to complex interactions between the white ovals and the GRS. The appearance of the South Temperate Zone (STZ)the zone in which the white ovals originatedis highly variable.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other features on Jupiter that are either temporary or difficult to observe from Earth. The South South Temperate Region is harder to discern even than the NNTR; its detail is subtle and can only be studied well by large telescopes or spacecraft.[46] Many zones and belts are more transient in nature and are not always visible. These include the Equatorial band (EB),[47] North Equatorial belt zone (NEBZ, a white zone within the belt) and South Equatorial belt zone (SEBZ).[48] Belts are also occasionally split by a sudden disturbance. When a disturbance divides a normally singular belt or zone, an N or an S is added to indicate whether the component is the northern or southern one; e.g., NEB(N) and NEB(S).[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nCirculation in Jupiter's atmosphere is markedly different from that in the atmosphere of Earth. The interior of Jupiter is fluid and lacks any solid surface. Therefore, convection may occur throughout the planet's outer molecular envelope. As of 2008, a comprehensive theory of the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere has not been developed. Any such theory needs to explain the following facts: the existence of narrow stable bands and jets that are symmetric relative to Jupiter's equator, the strong prograde jet observed at the equator, the difference between zones and belts, and the origin and persistence of large vortices such as the Great Red Spot.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theories regarding the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere can be broadly divided into two classes: shallow and deep. The former hold that the observed circulation is largely confined to a thin outer (weather) layer of the planet, which overlays the stable interior. The latter hypothesis postulates that the observed atmospheric flows are only a surface manifestation of deeply rooted circulation in the outer molecular envelope of Jupiter.[50] As both theories have their own successes and failures, many planetary scientists think that the true theory will include elements of both models.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first attempts to explain Jovian atmospheric dynamics date back to the 1960s.[50][52] They were partly based on terrestrial meteorology, which had become well developed by that time. Those shallow models assumed that the jets on Jupiter are driven by small scale turbulence, which is in turn maintained by moist convection in the outer layer of the atmosphere (above the water clouds).[53][54] The moist convection is a phenomenon related to the condensation and evaporation of water and is one of the major drivers of terrestrial weather.[55] The production of the jets in this model is related to a well-known property of two dimensional turbulencethe so-called inverse cascade, in which small turbulent structures (vortices) merge to form larger ones.[53] The finite size of the planet means that the cascade can not produce structures larger than some characteristic scale, which for Jupiter is called the Rhines scale. Its existence is connected to production of Rossby waves. This process works as follows: when the largest turbulent structures reach a certain size, the energy begins to flow into Rossby waves instead of larger structures, and the inverse cascade stops.[56] Since on the spherical rapidly rotating planet the dispersion relation of the Rossby waves is anisotropic, the Rhines scale in the direction parallel to the equator is larger than in the direction orthogonal to it.[56] The ultimate result of the process described above is production of large scale elongated structures, which are parallel to the equator. The meridional extent of them appears to match the actual width of jets.[53] Therefore, in shallow models vortices actually feed the jets and should disappear by merging into them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile these weatherÿlayer models can successfully explain the existence of a dozen narrow jets, they have serious problems.[53] A glaring failure of the model is the prograde (super-rotating) equatorial jet: with some rare exceptions shallow models produce a strong retrograde (subrotating) jet, contrary to observations. In addition, the jets tend to be unstable and can disappear over time.[53] Shallow models cannot explain how the observed atmospheric flows on Jupiter violate stability criteria.[57] More elaborated multilayer versions of weatherÿlayer models produce more stable circulation, but many problems persist.[58] Meanwhile, the Galileo Probe found that the winds on Jupiter extend well below the water clouds at 5ÿ7?bar and do not show any evidence of decay down to 22?bar pressure level, which implies that circulation in the Jovian atmosphere may in fact be deep.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deep model was first proposed by Busse in 1976.[59][60] His model was based on another well-known feature of fluid mechanics, the TaylorÿProudman theorem. It holds that in any fast-rotating barotropic ideal liquid, the flows are organized in a series of cylinders parallel to the rotational axis. The conditions of the theorem are probably met in the fluid Jovian interior. Therefore, the planet's molecular hydrogen mantle may be divided into cylinders, each cylinder having a circulation independent of the others.[61] Those latitudes where the cylinders' outer and inner boundaries intersect with the visible surface of the planet correspond to the jets; the cylinders themselves are observed as zones and belts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deep model easily explains the strong prograde jet observed at the equator of Jupiter; the jets it produces are stable and do not obey the 2D stability criterion.[61] However it has major difficulties; it produces a very small number of broad jets, and realistic simulations of 3D flows are not possible as of 2008, meaning that the simplified models used to justify deep circulation may fail to catch important aspects of the fluid dynamics within Jupiter.[61] One model published in 2004 successfully reproduced the Jovian band-jet structure.[51] It assumed that the molecular hydrogen mantle is thinner than in all other models; occupying only the outer 10% of Jupiter's radius. In standard models of the Jovian interior, the mantle comprises the outer 20ÿ30%.[62] The driving of deep circulation is another problem. The deep flows can be caused both by shallow forces (moist convection, for instance) or by deep planet-wide convection that transports heat out of the Jovian interior.[53] Which of these mechanisms is more important is not clear yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs has been known since 1966,[63] Jupiter radiates much more heat than it receives from the Sun. It is estimated that the ratio between the power emitted by the planet and that absorbed from the Sun is 1.67 I 0.09. The internal heat flux from Jupiter is 5.44 I 0.43 W/m2, whereas the total emitted power is 335 I 26 petawatts. The latter value is approximately equal to one billionth of the total power radiated by the Sun. This excess heat is mainly the primordial heat from the early phases of Jupiter's formation, but may result in part from the precipitation of helium into the core.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe internal heat may be important for the dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere. While Jupiter has a small obliquity of about 3, and its poles receive much less solar radiation than its equator, the tropospheric temperatures do not change appreciably from the equator to poles. One explanation is that Jupiter's convective interior acts like a thermostat, releasing more heat near the poles than in the equatorial region. This leads to a uniform temperature in the troposphere. While heat is transported from the equator to the poles mainly via the atmosphere on Earth, on Jupiter deep convection equilibrates heat. The convection in the Jovian interior is thought to be driven mainly by the internal heat.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter is home to hundreds of vorticescircular rotating structures that, as in the Earth's atmosphere, can be divided into two classes: cyclones and anticyclones.[8] Cyclones rotate in the direction similar to the rotation of the planet (counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern); anticyclones rotate in the reverse direction. However, unlike in the terrestrial atmosphere, anticyclones predominate over cyclones on Jupitermore than 90% of vortices larger than 2000?km in diameter are anticyclones.[66] The lifetime of Jovian vortices varies from several days to hundreds of years, depending on their size. For instance, the average lifetime of an anticyclone between 1000 and 6000?km in diameter is 1ÿ3 years.[67] Vortices have never been observed in the equatorial region of Jupiter (within 10 of latitude), where they are unstable.[11] As on any rapidly rotating planet, Jupiter's anticyclones are high pressure centers, while cyclones are low pressure.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anticyclones in Jupiter's atmosphere are always confined within zones, where the wind speed increases in direction from the equator to the poles.[67] They are usually bright and appear as white ovals.[8] They can move in longitude, but stay at approximately the same latitude as they are unable to escape from the confining zone.[11] The wind speeds at their periphery are about 100?m/s.[10] Different anticyclones located in one zone tend to merge, when they approach each other.[69] However Jupiter has two anticyclones that are somewhat different from all others. They are the Great Red Spot (GRS)[9] and the Oval BA;[10] the latter formed only in 2000. In contrast to white ovals, these structures are red, arguably due to dredging up of red material from the planet's depths.[9] On Jupiter the anticyclones usually form through merges of smaller structures including convective storms (see below),[67] although large ovals can result from the instability of jets. The latter was observed in 1938ÿ1940, when a few white ovals appeared as a result of instability of the southern temperate zone; they later merged to form Oval BA.[10][67]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to anticyclones, the Jovian cyclones tend to be small, dark and irregular structures. Some of the darker and more regular features are known as brown ovals (or badges).[66] However the existence of a few longÿlived large cyclones has been suggested. In addition to compact cyclones, Jupiter has several large irregular filamentary patches, which demonstrate cyclonic rotation.[8] One of them is located to the west of the GRS (in its wake region) in the southern equatorial belt.[70] These patches are called cyclonic regions (CR). The cyclones are always located in the belts and tend to merge when they encounter each other, much like anticyclones.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deep structure of vortices is not completely clear. They are thought to be relatively thin, as any thickness greater than about 500?km will lead to instability. The large anticyclones are known to extend only a few tens of kilometers above the visible clouds. The early hypothesis that the vortices are deep convective plumes (or convective columns) as of 2008 is not shared by the majority of planetary scientists.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot (GRS) is a persistent anticyclonic storm, 22 south of Jupiter's equator; observations from Earth establish a minimum storm lifetime of 350 years.[72][73] A storm was described as a \\"permanent spot\\" by Gian Domenico Cassini after observing the feature in July 1665 with his instrument-maker Eustachio Divini.[74]  According to a report by Giovanni Battista Riccioli in 1635, Leander Bandtius, whom Riccioli identified as the Abbot of Dunisburgh who possessed an \\"extraordinary telescope\\", observed a large spot that he described as \\"oval, equaling one seventh of Jupiter's diameter at its longest.\\" According to Riccioli, \\"these features are seldom able to be seen, and then only by a telescope of exceptional quality and magnification.\\"[75]  The Great Spot has been nearly continually observed since the 1870s, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GRS rotates counter-clockwise, with a period of about six Earth days[76] or 14?Jovian days. Its dimensions are 24,000ÿ40,000?km east-to-west and 12,000ÿ14,000?km north-to-south. The spot is large enough to contain two or three planets the size of Earth. At the start of 2004, the Great Red Spot had approximately half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago, when it was 40,000?km in diameter. At the present rate of reduction, it could potentially become circular by 2040, although this is unlikely because of the distortion effect of the neighboring jet streams.[77] It is not known how long the spot will last, or whether the change is a result of normal fluctuations.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a study by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, between 1996 and 2006 the spot lost 15?percent of its diameter along its major axis. Xylar Asay-Davis, who was on the team that conducted the study, noted that the spot is not disappearing because \\"velocity is a more robust measurement because the clouds associated with the Red Spot are also strongly influenced by numerous other phenomena in the surrounding atmosphere.\\"[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared data have long indicated that the Great Red Spot is colder (and thus, higher in altitude) than most of the other clouds on the planet;[80] the cloudtops of the GRS are about 8?km above the surrounding clouds. Furthermore, careful tracking of atmospheric features revealed the spot's counterclockwise circulation as far back as 1966 ÿ observations dramatically confirmed by the first time-lapse movies from the Voyager flybys.[81] The spot is spatially confined by a modest eastward jet stream (prograde) to its south and a very strong westward (retrograde) one to its north.[82] Though winds around the edge of the spot peak at about 120?m/s (432?km/h), currents inside it seem stagnant, with little inflow or outflow.[83] The rotation period of the spot has decreased with time, perhaps as a direct result of its steady reduction in size.[84] In 2010, astronomers imaged the GRS in the far infrared (from 8.5 to 24?m) with a spatial resolution higher than ever before and found that its central, reddest region is warmer than its surroundings by between 3ÿ4?K. The warm airmass is located in the upper troposphere in the pressure range of 200ÿ500?mbar. This warm central spot slowly counter-rotates and may be caused by a weak subsidence of air in the center of GRS.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot's latitude has been stable for the duration of good observational records, typically varying by about a degree. Its longitude, however, is subject to constant variation.[86][87] Because Jupiter's visible features do not rotate uniformly at all latitudes, astronomers have defined three different systems for defining the longitude. System?II is used for latitudes of more than 10, and was originally based on the average rotation rate of the Great Red Spot of 9h?55m?42s.[88][89] Despite this, the spot has 'lapped' the planet in System?II at least 10?times since the early 19th?century. Its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the South Equatorial Belt, and the presence or absence of a South Tropical Disturbance.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not known exactly what causes the Great Red Spot's reddish color. Theories supported by laboratory experiments suppose that the color may be caused by complex organic molecules, red phosphorus, or yet another sulfur compound. The GRS varies greatly in hue, from almost brick-red to pale salmon, or even white. The higher temperature of the reddest central region  is the first evidence that the Spot's color is affected by environmental factors.[85] The spot occasionally disappears from the visible spectrum, becoming evident only through the Red Spot Hollow, which is its niche in the South Equatorial Belt?(SEB). The visibility of GRS is apparently coupled to the appearance of the SEB; when the belt is bright white, the spot tends to be dark, and when it is dark, the spot is usually light. The periods when the spot is dark or light occur at irregular intervals; in the 50 years from 1947 to 1997, the spot was darkest in the periods 1961ÿ1966, 1968ÿ1975, 1989ÿ1990, and 1992ÿ1993.[91]  In November 2014, an analysis of data from NASA's Cassini mission revealed that the red color is likely a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet's upper atmosphere [92][93]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot should not be confused with the Great Dark Spot, a feature observed near Jupiter's north pole in 2000 by the CassiniÿHuygens spacecraft.[94] A feature in the atmosphere of Neptune was also called the Great Dark Spot. The latter feature, imaged by Voyager 2 in 1989, may have been an atmospheric hole rather than a storm. It was no longer present in 1994, although a similar spot had appeared farther to the north.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nOval BA is a red storm in Jupiter's southern hemisphere similar in form to, though smaller than, the Great Red Spot (it is often affectionately referred to as \\"Red Spot Jr.\\", \\"Red Jr.\\" or \\"The Little Red Spot\\"). A feature in the South Temperate Belt, Oval BA was first seen in 2000 after the collision of three small white storms, and has intensified since then.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formation of the three white oval storms that later merged into Oval BA can be traced to 1939, when the South Temperate Zone was torn by dark features that effectively split the zone into three long sections. Jovian observer Elmer J. Reese labeled the dark sections AB, CD, and EF. The rifts expanded, shrinking the remaining segments of the STZ into the white ovals FA, BC, and DE.[97] Ovals BC and DE merged in 1998, forming Oval BE. Then, in March 2000, BE and FA joined together, forming Oval BA.[96] (see White ovals, below)\\r\\n\\r\\nOval BA slowly began to turn red in August 2005.[98] On February 24, 2006, Filipino amateur astronomer Christopher Go discovered the color change, noting that it had reached the same shade as the GRS.[98] As a result, NASA writer Dr. Tony Phillips suggested it be called \\"Red Spot Jr.\\" or \\"Red Jr.\\"[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2006, a team of astronomers, believing that Oval BA might converge with the GRS that year, observed the storms through the Hubble Space Telescope.[100] The storms pass each other about every two years, but the passings of 2002 and 2004 did not produce anything exciting. Dr. Amy Simon-Miller, of the Goddard Space Flight Center, predicted the storms would have their closest passing on July 4, 2006.[100] On July 20, the two storms were photographed passing each other by the Gemini Observatory without converging.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy Oval BA turned red is not understood. According to a 2008 study by Dr. Santiago Prez-Hoyos of the University of the Basque Country, the most likely mechanism is \\"an upward and inward diffusion of either a colored compound or a coating vapor that may interact later with high energy solar photons at the upper levels of Oval BA.\\"[102] Some believe that small storms (and their corresponding white spots) on Jupiter turn red when the winds become powerful enough to draw certain gases from deeper within the atmosphere which change color when those gases are exposed to sunlight.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nOval BA is getting stronger according to observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2007. The wind speeds have reached 618?km/h; about the same as in the Great Red Spot and far stronger than any of the progenitor storms.[104][105] As of July 2008, its size is about the diameter of Earthapproximately half the size of the Great Red Spot.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nOval BA should not be confused with another major storm on Jupiter, the South Tropical Little Red Spot (LRS) (nicknamed \\"the Baby Red Spot\\" by NASA[106]), which was destroyed by the GRS.[103] The new storm, previously a white spot in Hubble images, turned red in May 2008.  The observations were led by Imke de Pater of the University of California, at Berkeley, US.[107] The Baby Red Spot encountered the GRS in late June to early July 2008, and in the course of a collision, the smaller red spot was shredded into pieces. The remnants of the Baby Red Spot first orbited, then were later consumed by the GRS. The last of the remnants with a reddish color to have been identified by astronomers had disappeared by mid-July, and the remaining pieces again collided with the GRS, then finally merged with the bigger storm. The remaining pieces of the Baby Red Spot had completely disappeared by August 2008.[106] During this encounter Oval BA was present nearby, but played no apparent role in destruction of the Baby Red Spot.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe storms on Jupiter are similar to thunderstorms on Earth. They reveal themselves via bright clumpy clouds about 1000?km in size, which appear from time to time in the belts' cyclonic regions, especially within the strong westward (retrograde) jets.[109] In contrast to vortices, storms are short-lived phenomena; the strongest of them may exist for several months, while the average lifetime is only 3ÿ4 days.[109] They are believed to be due mainly to moist convection within Jupiter's troposphere. Storms are actually tall convective columns (plumes), which bring the wet air from the depths to the upper part of the troposphere, where it condenses in clouds. A typical vertical extent of Jovian storms is about 100?km; as they extend from a pressure level of about 5ÿ7?bar, where the base of a hypothetical water cloud layer is located, to as high as 0.2ÿ0.5?bar.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nStorms on Jupiter are always associated with lightning. The imaging of the nightÿside hemisphere of Jupiter by Galileo and Cassini spacecraft revealed regular light flashes in Jovian belts and near the locations of the westward jets, particularly at 51N, 56S and 14S latitudes.[111] On Jupiter lighting strikes are on average a few times more powerful than those on Earth. However, they are less frequent; the light power emitted from a given area is similar to that on Earth.[111] A few flashes have been detected in polar regions, making Jupiter the second known planet after Earth to exhibit polar lightning.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery 15ÿ17 years Jupiter is marked by especially powerful storms. They appear at 23N latitude, where the strongest eastward jet, that can reach 150?m/s, is located. The last time such an event was observed was in MarchÿJune 2007.[110] Two storms appeared in the northern temperate belt 55 apart in longitude. They significantly disturbed the belt. The dark material that was shed by the storms mixed with clouds and changed the belt's color. The storms moved with a speed as high as 170?m/s, slightly faster than the jet itself, hinting at the existence of strong winds deep in the atmosphere.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe normal pattern of bands and zones is sometimes disrupted for periods of time. One particular class of disruption are long-lived darkenings of the South Tropical Zone, normally referred to as \\"South Tropical Disturbances\\" (STD). The longest lived STD in recorded history was followed from 1901 until 1939, having been first seen by Percy B. Molesworth on February 28, 1901. It took the form of darkening over part of the normally bright South Tropical zone. Several similar disturbances in the South Tropical Zone have been recorded since then.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most mysterious features in the atmosphere of Jupiter are hot spots. In them the air is relatively free of clouds and heat can escape from the depths without much absorption. The spots look like bright spots in the infrared images obtained at the wavelength of about 5?m.[38] They are preferentially located in the belts, although there is a train of prominent hot spots at the northern edge of the Equatorial Zone. The Galileo Probe descended into one of those equatorial spots. Each equatorial spot is associated with a bright cloudy plume located to the west of it and reaching up to 10,000?km in size.[6] Hot spots generally have round shapes, although they do not resemble vortexes.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of hot spots is not clear. They can be either downdrafts, where the descending air is adiabatically heated and dried  or, alternatively, they can be a manifestation of planetary scale waves. The latter hypotheses explains the periodical pattern of the equatorial spots.[6][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly modern astronomers, using small telescopes, recorded the changing appearance of Jupiter's atmosphere.[23] Their descriptive termsbelts and zones, brown spots and red spots, plumes, barges, festoons, and streamersare still used.[114] Other terms such as vorticity, vertical motion, cloud heights have entered in use later, in the 20th century.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first observations of the Jovian atmosphere at higher resolution than possible with Earth-based telescopes were taken by the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. The first truly detailed images of Jupiter's atmosphere were provided by the Voyagers.[23] The two spacecraft were able to image details at a resolution as low as 5?km in size in various spectra, and also able to create \\"approach movies\\" of the atmosphere in motion.[23] The Galileo Probe, which suffered an antenna problem, saw less of Jupiter's atmosphere but at a better average resolution and a wider spectral bandwidth.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, astronomers have access to a continuous record of Jupiter's atmospheric activity thanks to telescopes such as Hubble Space Telescope. These show that the atmosphere is occasionally wracked by massive disturbances, but that, overall, it is remarkably stable.[23] The vertical motion of Jupiter's atmosphere was largely determined by the identification of trace gases by ground-based telescopes.[23] Spectroscopic studies after the collision of Comet ShoemakerÿLevy 9 gave a glimpse of the Jupiter's composition beneath the cloud tops. The presence of diatomic sulfur (S2) and carbon disulfide (CS2) was recordedthe first detection of either in Jupiter, and only the second detection of S2 in any astronomical object together with other molecules such as ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), while oxygen-bearing molecules such as sulfur dioxide were not detected, to the surprise of astronomers.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galileo atmospheric probe, as it plunged into Jupiter, measured the wind, temperature, composition, clouds, and radiation levels down to 22?bar. However, below 1?bar elsewhere on Jupiter there is uncertainty in the quantities.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first sighting of the GRS is often credited to Robert Hooke, who described a spot on the planet in May 1664; however, it is likely that Hooke's spot was in the wrong belt altogether (the North Equatorial Belt, versus the current location in the South Equatorial Belt). Much more convincing is Giovanni Cassini's description of a \\"permanent spot\\" in the following year.[116] With fluctuations in visibility, Cassini's spot was observed from 1665 to 1713.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nA minor mystery concerns a Jovian spot depicted around 1700 on a canvas by Donato Creti, which is exhibited in the Vatican.[118][119] It is a part of a series of panels in which different (magnified) heavenly bodies serve as backdrops for various Italian scenes, the creation of all of them overseen by the astronomer Eustachio Manfredi for accuracy. Creti's painting is the first known to depict the GRS as red. No Jovian feature was officially described as red before the late 19th century.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present GRS was first seen only after 1830 and well-studied only after a prominent apparition in 1879. A 118-year gap separates the observations made after 1830 from its 17th-century discovery; whether the original spot dissipated and re-formed, whether it faded, or even if the observational record was simply poor are unknown.[91] The older spots had a short observational history and slower motion than that of the modern spot, which make their identity unlikely.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 25, 1979, when the Voyager 1 spacecraft was 9.2 million kilometers from Jupiter it transmitted the first detailed image of the Great Red Spot back to Earth. Cloud details as small as 160?km across were visible. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern seen to the west (left) of the GRS is the spot's wake region, where extraordinarily complex and variable cloud motions are observed.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe white ovals that were to become Oval BA formed in 1939. They covered almost 90 degrees of longitude shortly after their formation, but contracted rapidly during their first decade; their length stabilized at 10 degrees or less after 1965.[121] Although they originated as segments of the STZ, they evolved to become completely embedded in the South Temperate Belt, suggesting that they moved north, \\"digging\\" a niche into the STB.[122] Indeed, much like the GRS, their circulations were confined by two opposing jet streams on their northern and southern boundaries, with an eastward jet to their north and a retrograde westward one to the south.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe longitudinal movement of the ovals seemed to be influenced by two factors: Jupiter's position in its orbit (they became faster at aphelion), and their proximity to the GRS (they accelerated when within 50 degrees of the Spot).[123] The overall trend of the white oval drift rate was deceleration, with a decrease by half between 1940 and 1990.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Voyager fly-bys, the ovals extended roughly 9000?km from east to west, 5000?km from north to south, and rotated every five days (compared to six for the GRS at the time).[125]","input":"What is the most prominent feature in jupiter's atmosphere called?"},{"output":"During the Korean War","context":"The Yalu River, also called the Amrok River or Amnok River, is a river on the border between North Korea and China.

The bordering Chinese provinces are Jilin and Liaoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe river is 795?km (493?mi) long and receives water from over 30,000?km2 of land. The Yalu's most significant tributaries are the Changjin (???; ), the Hochon (???; ?), the Tongro (???; ?) and the Ai (郴T) rivers from Korea and the Hun from China. The river is not easily navigable for most of its length.[1] Most of the river freezes during winter and can be crossed on foot.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depth of the Yalu River varies from some of the more shallow parts on the eastern side in Hyesan (1 m) to the deeper parts of the river near the Yellow Sea (2.5 m).[3] The estuary is the site of the Amrok River estuary Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 205 islands are on the Yalu. A 1962 border treaty between North Korea and China split the islands according to which ethnic group was living on each island. North Korea possesses 127 and China 78.

In the course of the conflict every bridge across the river except one was destroyed. The one remaining bridge was the SinoÿKorean Friendship Bridge connecting Sinuiju, North Korea to Dandong, China. During the war the valley surrounding the western end of the river also became the focal point of a series of dogfights for air superiority over North Korea, earning the nickname \\"MiG Alley\\" in reference to the MiG-15 fighters flown by the combined North Korean, Chinese and Soviet forces.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the advance of UN forces during the Korean War toward the Yalu which allowed Chairman Mao Zedong to convince his people that China needed to intervene over fears of an American invasion, since toppling communism was one of America's stated goals and Douglas MacArthur had expressed his desire to expand the war into China.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe river has frequently been crossed by North Koreans fleeing to China since the early 1990s, although the Tumen River is the most used way.[6][citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe river is important for hydroelectric power, and one of the largest hydroelectric dams in Asia is in Sup'ung Dam, 106?m high and over 850?m long, located upstream from Sinuiju, North Korea. The dam has created an artificial lake over a portion of the river, called Sapung Lake. In addition the river is used for transportation, particularly of lumber from its forested banks. The river provides fish for the local population. Downstream of Sup'ung is the Taipingwan Dam. Upstream of Sup'ung is the Yunfeng Dam. Both dams produce hydroelectric power, as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the river delta upstream from Dandong and adjacent to Hushan are several North Korean villages. Economic conditions in these villages have been described as poor, without access to electricity.[7]","input":"When did un troops approach the yalu river?"},{"output":"Ireland","context":"Irish (Gaeilge), also referred to as Gaelic or Irish Gaelic,[4][not in citation given] is a Goidelic language (Gaelic) of the Indo-European language family originating in Ireland and historically spoken by the Irish people. Irish is spoken as a first language by a small minority of Irish people, and as a second language by a larger group of non-native speakers. Irish enjoys constitutional status as the national and first official language of the Republic of Ireland, and is an officially recognised minority language in Northern Ireland. It is also among the official languages of the European Union. The public body Foras na Gaeilge is responsible for the promotion of the language throughout the island of Ireland. Irish was the predominant language of the Irish people for most of their recorded history, and they brought it with them to other regions, notably Scotland and the Isle of Man, where Middle Irish gave rise to Scottish Gaelic and Manx respectively. It has the oldest vernacular literature in Western Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn An Caighden Oifigi~il (the official written standard) the name of the language is Gaeilge (Irish pronunciation:?[?e?l???]). Before the spelling reform of 1948, this form was spelled Gaedhilge; originally this was the genitive of Gaedhealg, the form used in Classical Irish.[5] Older spellings of this include Gaoidhealg in Classical Irish [?e???l?] and Godelc [?oieel?] in Old Irish. The modern spelling results from the deletion of the silent dh in the middle of Gaedhilge, whereas Goidelic, used to refer to the language family including Irish, is derived from the Old Irish term.\\r\\nOther forms of the name found in the various modern Irish dialects (in addition to south Connacht Gaeilge above) include Gaedhilic/Gaeilic/Gaeilig ([?e?l??c]) or Gaedhlag ([?e?l???]) in Ulster Irish and northern Connacht Irish and Gaedhealaing/Gaoluinn/Gaelainn ([?e?l?????/?e?l???n?])[6][7] in Munster Irish.\\r\\nIn Europe the language is usually referred to as Irish, with Gaelic or Irish Gaelic used in some instances elsewhere.[8] The term Irish Gaelic is often used when English speakers discuss the relationship between the three Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx).\\r\\nWritten Irish is first attested in Ogham inscriptions from the 4th century AD; this stage of the language is known as Primitive Irish. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain. Primitive Irish transitioned into Old Irish through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the Latin alphabet and is attested primarily in marginalia to Latin manuscripts. During this time, the Irish language absorbed some Latin words, some via Old Welsh, including ecclesiastical terms: examples are easpag (bishop) from episcopus, and Domhnach (Sunday, from dominica).\\r\\nBy the 10th century, Old Irish had evolved into Middle Irish, which was spoken throughout Ireland and in Scotland and the Isle of Man. It is the language of a large corpus of literature, including the Ulster Cycle. From the 12th century, Middle Irish began to evolve into modern Irish in Ireland, into Scottish Gaelic in Scotland, and into the Manx language in the Isle of Man. Early Modern Irish, dating from the 13th century, was the basis of the literary language of both Ireland and Gaelic-speaking Scotland. Modern Irish, as attested in the work of such writers as Geoffrey Keating, may be said to date from the 17th century, and was the medium of popular literature from that time on.\\r\\nFrom the 18th century on, the language lost ground in the east of the country. The reasons behind this shift were complex but came down to a number of factors:\\r\\nIt was a change characterised by diglossia (two languages being used by the same community in different social and economic situations) and transitional bilingualism (monoglot Irish-speaking grandparents with bilingual children and monoglot English-speaking grandchildren). By the mid-18th century, English was becoming a language of the Catholic middle class, the Catholic Church and public intellectuals, especially in the east of the country. Increasingly, as the value of English became apparent, the prohibition on Irish in schools had the sanction of parents.[10] Once it became apparent that immigration to the United States and Canada was likely for a large portion of the population, the importance of learning English became relevant. This allowed the new immigrants to get jobs in areas other than farming. It has been estimated that, due to the immigration to the United States because of the Famine, anywhere from a quarter to a third of the immigrants were Irish speakers.[11]\\r\\nIrish was not marginal to Ireland's modernisation in the 19th century, as often assumed. In the first half of the century there were still around three million people for whom Irish was the primary language, and their numbers alone made them a cultural and social force. Irish speakers often insisted on using the language in the law courts (even when they knew English), and Irish was also common in commercial transactions. The language was heavily implicated in the \\"devotional revolution\\" which marked the standardisation of Catholic religious practice and was also widely used in a political context. Down to the time of the Great Famine and even afterwards, the language was in use by all classes, Irish being an urban as well as a rural language.[12]\\r\\nThis linguistic dynamism was reflected in the efforts of certain public intellectuals to counter the decline of the language. At the end of the 19th century, they launched the Gaelic revival in an attempt to encourage the learning and use of Irish, although few adult learners mastered the language.[13] The vehicle of the revival was the Gaelic League (Conradh na Gaeilge), and particular emphasis was placed on the folk tradition, which in Irish is particularly rich. Efforts were also made to develop journalism and a modern literature.\\r\\nAssessing the overlooked role of the Catholic church in the decline of Irish, Tom Garvin wrote:\\r\\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, the Catholic Church, having been a major agent of the linguistic anglicisation of Ireland for two centuries [i.e., since c. 1680s], perpetrated an apparent volte-face. While continuing to ensure that its flock had a command of the English language, elements within the church suddenly proceeded to back the nationalist project of reviving the almost moribund Irish Gaelic language as the common tongue of the new Ireland that was imagined as emerging in the twentieth century. Many clerics denounced the British for what was described as the terrible crime of eradicating the Irish language through the school system, a crass distortion of historical fact. In reality, the Church had itself clearly been a major anglicising influence in the country and had commonly ensured that the language of political and social power was transmitted to the younger generation, usually at the expense of eradicating the older language. The sudden support for the Irish language was driven in part by an opportunistic and Machiavellian wish to appropriate a cultural property which was evidently a source of political power ... The alliance of priests and patriots that was being forged required some clerical tergiversation.[14]\\r\\nAlthough It has been noted that the Catholic Church played a role in the decline of the Irish Language, the church did make certain efforts to encourage the Irish language and find common ground through religion. The Old Testament was translated into Irish and came out around 1685 in order to reach out to the Irish speaking community. Bishop Bedell influenced the print and publishing of the Old Testament. The New Testament was also translated into Irish by an Archbishop of the church. Currently, modern day Irish speakers in the church are pushing for language revival.[15]\\r\\nIrish is given recognition by the Constitution of Ireland as the national and first official language of the Republic of Ireland (English is the other official language). Despite this, almost all government debates and business are conducted in English.[16] In 1938, the founder of Conradh na Gaeilge (Gaelic League), Douglas Hyde, was inaugurated as the first President of Ireland. The record of his delivering his inaugural Declaration of Office in Roscommon Irish remains almost the only surviving remnant of anyone speaking in that dialect.\\r\\nFrom the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922 (see also History of the Republic of Ireland), a degree of proficiency in Irish was required of all those newly appointed to the Civil Service of the Republic of Ireland, including postal workers, tax collectors, agricultural inspectors, etc.[17] Proficiency in just one official language for entrance to the public service was introduced in 1974, in part through the actions of protest organisations like the Language Freedom Movement.\\r\\nAlthough the Irish requirement was also dropped for wider public service jobs, Irish remains a required subject of study in all schools within the Republic which receive public money (see also Education in the Republic of Ireland). Those wishing to teach in primary schools in the State must also pass a compulsory examination called Scr~d~ Cilochta sa Ghaeilge. The need for a pass in Leaving Certificate Irish or English for entry to the Garda Sochna (police) was introduced in September 2005, and recruits are given lessons in the language during their two years of training. The most important official documents of the Irish government must be published in both Irish and English or Irish alone (in accordance with the Official Languages Act 2003, enforced by An Coimisinir Teanga, the Irish language ombudsman).\\r\\nThe National University of Ireland requires all students wishing to embark on a degree course in the NUI federal system to pass the subject of Irish in the Leaving Certificate or GCE/GCSE examinations.[18] Exemptions are made from this requirement for students born outside of the Republic of Ireland, those who were born in the Republic but completed primary education outside it, and students diagnosed with dyslexia. NUI Galway is required to appoint people who are competent in the Irish language, as long as they are also competent in all other aspects of the vacancy they are appointed to. This requirement is laid down by the University College Galway Act, 1929 (Section 3).[19]\\r\\nFor a number of years there has been vigorous debate in political, academic and other circles about the failure of most students in the mainstream (English-medium) schools to achieve competence in the language, even after fourteen years.[20][21][22] The concomitant decline in the number of traditional native speakers has also been a cause of great concern.[23][24][25][26] In 2007, filmmaker Manchn Magan found few speakers and some incredulity while speaking only Irish in Dublin. He was unable to accomplish some everyday tasks, as portrayed in his documentary No Barla.[27]\\r\\nThere is, however, a growing body of Irish speakers in the cities. Most of these are products of an independent education system in which Irish is the sole language of instruction. Such schools are known as Gaelscoileanna. These Irish-medium schools send a much higher proportion of pupils on to tertiary level than do the mainstream schools, and it seems increasingly likely that, within a generation, habitual users of Irish will typically be members of an urban, middle class and highly educated minority.[28] Parliamentary legislation is supposed to be available in both Irish and English but is frequently only available in English. This is notwithstanding that Article 25.4 of the Constitution of Ireland requires that an \\"official translation\\" of any law in one official language be provided immediately in the other official language, if not already passed in both official languages.[29]\\r\\nIn November 2016, it was reported that many people worldwide were learning Irish through the Duolingo app.[30] Irish president Michael Higgins officially honoured several volunteer translators for developing the Irish edition, and said the push for Irish language rights remains an \\"unfinished project\\".[31]\\r\\nThere are rural areas of Ireland where Irish is still spoken daily to some extent as a first language. These regions are known individually and collectively as the Gaeltacht, or in the plural as Gaeltachta. While the Gaeltacht's fluent Irish speakers, whose numbers have been estimated at twenty or thirty thousand,[32] are a minority of the total number of fluent Irish speakers, they represent a higher concentration of Irish speakers than other parts of the country and it is only in Gaeltacht areas that Irish continues, to some extent, to be spoken as a community vernacular.\\r\\nAccording to data compiled by the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, only one quarter of households in officially Gaeltacht areas are fluent in Irish. The author of a detailed analysis of the survey, Donncha ܇ hallaithe of the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, described the Irish language policy followed by Irish governments as a \\"complete and absolute disaster\\". The Irish Times, referring to his analysis published in the Irish language newspaper Foinse, quoted him as follows: \\"It is an absolute indictment of successive Irish Governments that at the foundation of the Irish State there were 250,000 fluent Irish speakers living in Irish-speaking or semi Irish-speaking areas, but the number now is between 20,000 and 30,000\\".[32]\\r\\nIn the 1920s, when the Irish Free State was founded, Irish was still a vernacular in some western coastal areas.[33] In the 1930s, areas where more than 25% of the population spoke Irish were classified as Gaeltacht. The strongest Gaeltacht areas, numerically and socially, are those of South Connemara, the west of the Dingle Peninsula and northwest Donegal, where many residents still use Irish as their primary language. These areas are often referred to as the For-Ghaeltacht (\\"true Gaeltacht\\"), a term originally officially applied to areas where over 50% of the population spoke Irish.\\r\\nThere are larger Gaeltacht regions in County Galway (Contae na Gaillimhe), including Connemara (Conamara), the Aran Islands (Oilein rann), Carraroe (An Cheathr~ Rua) and Spiddal (An Spidal), on the west coast of County Donegal (Contae Dh~n na nGall), and on the Dingle (Corca Dhuibhne) and Iveragh Peninsulas (Uibh Rathach) in County Kerry (Contae Chiarra).\\r\\nSmaller ones also exist in Counties Mayo (Contae Mhaigh Eo), Meath (Contae na M), Waterford (An Rinn, Contae Phort Lirge), and Cork (Contae Chorca). Gweedore (Gaoth Dobhair), County Donegal, is the largest Gaeltacht parish in Ireland.\\r\\nIrish language summer colleges in the Gaeltacht are attended by tens of thousands of teenagers annually. Students live with Gaeltacht families, attend classes, participate in sports, go to cilithe and are obliged to speak Irish. All aspects of Irish culture and tradition are encouraged. The most popular summertime Gaeltacht is Coliste Lurgan[34] in Galway. Its main aim is to promote Irish speaking among young people in an enjoyable and stimulating way.\\r\\nBefore the partition of Ireland in 1921, Irish was recognised as a school subject and as \\"Celtic\\" in some third level institutions. Between 1921 and 1972, Northern Ireland had devolved government. During those years the political party holding power in the Stormont Parliament, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), was hostile to the language. The context of this hostility was the use of the language by nationalists.[35] In broadcasting, there was an exclusion on the reporting of minority cultural issues, and Irish was excluded from radio and television for almost the first fifty years of the previous devolved government.[36] The language received a degree of formal recognition in Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom, under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement,[37] and then, in 2003, by the British government's ratification in respect of the language of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. While the British government promised to create legislation encouraging the language as part of the 2006 St Andrews Agreement,[38] it has yet to do so.[39] The Irish Language is often used as a bargaining chip during government formation in Northern Ireland, something which is often protested by organisations and groups such as An Dream Dearg.\\r\\nIrish became an official language of the EU on 1 January 2007, meaning that MEPs with Irish fluency can now speak the language in the European Parliament and at committees, although in the case of the latter they have to give prior notice to a simultaneous interpreter in order to ensure that what they say can be interpreted into other languages. While an official language of the European Union, only co-decision regulations must be available in Irish for the moment, due to a renewable five-year derogation on what has to be translated, requested by the Irish Government when negotiating the language's new official status. Any expansion in the range of documents to be translated will depend on the results of the first five-year review and on whether the Irish authorities decide to seek an extension. The Irish government has committed itself to train the necessary number of translators and interpreters and to bear the related costs.[40] Derogation is expected to end completely by 2022.[41]\\r\\nBefore Irish became an official language it was afforded the status of treaty language and only the highest-level documents of the EU were made available in Irish.\\r\\nThe Irish language was carried abroad in the modern period by a vast diaspora, chiefly to Britain and North America, but also to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The first large movements began in the 17th century, largely as a result of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, which saw many Irish sent to the West Indies. Irish emigration to the United States was well established by the 18th century, and was reinforced in the 1840s by thousands fleeing from the Famine. This flight also affected Britain. Up until that time most emigrants spoke Irish as their first language, though English was steadily establishing itself as the primary language. Irish speakers had first arrived in Australia in the late 18th century as convicts and soldiers, and many Irish-speaking settlers followed, particularly in the 1860s. New Zealand also received some of this influx. Argentina was the only non-English-speaking country to receive large numbers of Irish emigrants, and there were few Irish speakers among them.\\r\\nRelatively few of the emigrants were literate in Irish, but manuscripts in the language were brought to both Australia and the United States, and it was in the United States that the first newspaper to make significant use of Irish was established.[citation needed] In Australia, too, the language found its way into print. The Gaelic revival, which started in Ireland in the 1890s, found a response abroad, with branches of Conradh na Gaeilge being established in all the countries to which Irish speakers had emigrated.\\r\\nThe decline of Irish in Ireland and a slowing of emigration helped to ensure a decline in the language abroad, along with natural attrition in the host countries. Despite this, a handful of enthusiasts continued to learn and cultivate Irish in diaspora countries and elsewhere, a trend which strengthened in the second half of the 20th century. Today the language is taught at tertiary level in North America, Australia and Europe, and Irish speakers outside Ireland contribute to journalism and literature in the language. There are significant Irish-speaking networks in the United States and Canada;[42] figures released for the period 2006ÿ2008 show that 22,279 Americans claimed to speak Irish at home.[43]\\r\\nThe Irish language is also one of the languages of the Celtic League, a non-governmental organisation that promotes self-determination and Celtic identity and culture in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, Cornwall and the Isle of Man, known as the Celtic nations. It places particular emphasis on the indigenous Celtic languages. It is recognised by the United Nations as a non-governmental organisation with \\"Roster Status\\" and is part of the UN's Economic and Social Council. The organisation has branches in all the Celtic nations and in Patagonia, Argentina, New York City, US, and London, UK.\\r\\nIrish was spoken as a community language until the early 20th century on the island of Newfoundland, in a form known as Newfoundland Irish.\\r\\nThe following 2016 census data shows:\\r\\nThe total number of people who answered yes to being able to speak Irish in April 2016 was 1,761,420, a slight decrease (0.7 per cent) on the 2011 figure of 1,774,437. This represents 39.8 per cent of respondents compared with 41.4 in 2011... Of the 73,803 daily Irish speakers (outside the education system), 20,586 (27.9%) lived in Gaeltacht areas.\\r\\n[44]\\r\\nIrish is represented by several traditional dialects and by various varieties of \\"urban\\" Irish. The latter, though sometimes referred to as \\"modern Irish,\\" has acquired a life of its own and a growing number of native speakers. Differences between the dialects make themselves felt in stress, intonation, vocabulary and structural features.\\r\\nRoughly speaking, the three major dialect areas which survive coincide with the provinces of Munster (C~ige Mumhan), Connacht (C~ige Chonnacht) and Ulster (C~ige Uladh). Records of some dialects of Leinster were made by the Irish Folklore Commission and others prior to their extinction. Newfoundland, in eastern Canada, had a form of Irish derived from the Munster Irish of the later 18th century (see Newfoundland Irish).\\r\\nDown to the early 19th century and even later, Irish was spoken in all the counties of Leinster: Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Louth, Meath, Westmeath, Offaly, Wexford and Wicklow. The evidence furnished by placenames, literary sources and recorded speech indicates that there were three dialects spoken in Leinster: one main dialect and two of lesser significance. The minor dialects were represented by the Ulster speech of counties Meath and Louth, which extended as far south as the Boyne valley, and a Munster dialect found in Kilkenny and south Laois. The main dialect was represented by a broad central belt stretching from west Connacht eastwards to the Liffey estuary and southwards to Wexford, though with many local variations.\\r\\nThe main dialect had characteristics which survive today only in the Irish of Connacht. It typically placed the stress on the first syllable of a word, and showed a preference (found in placenames) for the pronunciation cr where the standard spelling is cn. The word cnoc (hill) would therefore be pronounced croc. Examples are the placenames Crooksling (Cnoc Slinne) in County Dublin and Crukeen (Cnoicn) in Carlow. East Leinster showed the same diphthongisation or vowel lengthening as in Munster and Connacht Irish in words like poll (hole), cill (monastery), coill (wood), ceann (head), cam (crooked) and dream (crowd). A feature of the dialect was the pronunciation of the vowel ao, which generally became ae in east Leinster (as in Munster), and  in the west (as in Connacht).[45]\\r\\nEarly evidence regarding colloquial Irish in east Leinster is found in The Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge (1547), by the English physician and traveller Andrew Borde.[46] The illustrative phrases he uses include the following (with regularised Irish spelling in brackets):\\r\\nThe Pale (An Phil) was an area around late medieval Dublin under the control of the English government. By the late 15th century it consisted of an area along the coast from Dalkey, south of Dublin, to the garrison town of Dundalk, with an inland boundary encompassing Naas and Leixlip in the Earldom of Kildare and Trim and Kells in County Meath to the north. Into this area of \\"Englyshe tunge\\" the Irish language steadily advanced. An English official remarked of the Pale in 1515 that \\"all the common people of the said half counties that obeyeth the King's laws, for the most part be of Irish birth, of Irish habit and of Irish language\\".[47]\\r\\nWith the strengthening of English cultural and political control, language reversal began to occur, but this did not become clearly evident until the 18th century. Even then, in the decennial period 1771ÿ81, the percentage of Irish speakers in Meath was at least 41%. By 1851 this had fallen to less than 3%.[48]\\r\\nEnglish expanded strongly in Leinster in the 18th century, but Irish speakers were still numerous. In the decennial period 1771ÿ81 certain counties had estimated percentages of Irish speakers as follows (though the estimates are likely to be too low):[48]\\r\\nThe language saw its most rapid initial decline in Laois, Wexford, Wicklow, County Dublin and perhaps Kildare. The proportion of Irish-speaking children in Leinster went down as follows: 17% in the 1700s, 11% in the 1800s, 3% in the 1830s and virtually none in the 1860s.[49]\\r\\nThe Irish census of 1851 showed that there were still a number of older speakers in County Dublin.[48] Sound recordings were made between 1928 and 1931 of some of the last speakers in Omeath, County Louth (now available in digital form).[50] The last known traditional native speaker in Omeath, and in Leinster as a whole, was Annie O'Hanlon (ne Dobbin), who died in 1960.[10]\\r\\nMunster Irish is mainly spoken in the Gaeltacht areas of Kerry (Contae Chiarra), Ring (An Rinn) near Dungarvan (D~n Garbhin) in Waterford (Contae Phort Lirge) and Muskerry (M~scra) and Cape Clear Island (Oilen Chlire) in the western part of Cork (Contae Chorca). The most important subdivision in Munster is that between Decies Irish (Na Dise) (spoken in Waterford) and the rest of Munster Irish.\\r\\nSome typical features of Munster Irish are:\\r\\nHistorically, Connacht Irish represents the westernmost remnant of a dialect area which stretched across the centre of Ireland to the east coast. The strongest dialect of Connacht Irish is to be found in Connemara and the Aran Islands. Much closer to the larger Connacht Gaeltacht is the dialect spoken in the smaller region on the border between Galway (Gaillimh) and Mayo (Maigh Eo). The northern Mayo dialect of Erris (Iorras) and Achill (Acaill) is in grammar and morphology essentially a Connacht dialect, but shows some similarities to Ulster Irish due to large-scale immigration of dispossessed people following the Plantation of Ulster though it is this form of Irish which is closest to the true original Connacht dialect which would have been spoken in Counties Sligo, Roscommon, Leitrim and East Galway.\\r\\nFeatures in Connacht Irish differing from the official standard include a preference for verbal nouns ending in -achan, e.g. lagachan instead of lag~, \\"weakening\\". The non-standard pronunciation of the Gaeltacht Cois Fharraige area with lengthened vowels and heavily reduced endings gives it a distinct sound. Distinguishing features of Connacht and Ulster dialect include the pronunciation of word final broad bh and mh as [w], rather than as [v?] in Munster. For example, sliabh (\\"mountain\\") is pronounced [?l?i?w] in Connacht and Ulster as opposed to [?l?i?] in the south. In addition Connacht and Ulster speakers tend to include the \\"we\\" pronoun rather than use the standard compound form used in Munster e.g. bh muid is used for \\"we were\\" instead of bhomar.\\r\\nAs in Munster Irish, some short vowels are lengthened and others diphthongised before -nn, -m, -rr, -rd, -ll, in monosyllabic words and in the stressed syllable of multisyllabic words where the syllable is followed by a consonant. This can be seen in ceann [c:n] \\"head\\", cam [k:m] \\"crooked\\", gearr [g?:r] \\"short\\", ord [ourd] \\"sledgehammer\\", gall [g:l] \\"foreigner, non-Gael\\", iontas [i:nt?s] \\"a wonder, a marvel\\", etc. The form '-aibh', when occurring at the end of words like 'agaibh', tends to be pronounced as an 'ee' sound.\\r\\nThere are a number of differences between the popular South Connemara form of Irish, the Mid-Connacht/Joyce Country form (on the border between Mayo and Galway) and the Achill and Erris forms in the north of the province.\\r\\nIn South Connemara, for example, there is an tendency to substitute a \\"b\\" sound at the end of words ending in \\"bh\\" [], such as sibh, libh and d܇ibh, something not found in the rest of Connacht (these words would be pronounced respectively as \\"shiv,\\" \\"liv\\" and \\"d܇fa\\" in the other areas). This placing of the B-sound is also present at the end of words ending in vowels, such as acu (pronounced as \\"acub\\") and leo (pronounced as \\"lyohab\\"). There is also a tendency to omit the \\"g\\" sound in words such as agam, agat and againn, a characteristic also of other Connacht dialects. All these pronunciations are distinctively regional.\\r\\nThe pronunciation prevalent in the Joyce Country (the area around Lough Corrib and Lough Mask) is quite similar to that of South Connemara, with a similar approach to the words agam, agat and againn and a similar approach to pronunciation of vowels and consonants. But there are noticeable differences in vocabulary, with certain words such as doiligh (difficult) and foscailte being preferred to the more usual deacair and oscailte. Another interesting aspect of this sub-dialect is that almost all vowels at the end of words tend to be pronounced as : eile (other), cosa (feet) and danta (done) tend to be pronounced as eil, cosa and danta respectively.\\r\\nThe Irish of Achill and Erris tends to differ from that of South Connacht in many aspects of vocabulary and, in some instances, of pronunciation. It is often stated that the Irish of these regions has much in common with Ulster Irish, with words ending -mh and -bh having a much softer sound, with a tendency to terminate words such as leo and d܇ibh with \\"f\\", giving leofa and d܇fa respectively. In addition to a vocabulary typical of other area of Connacht, one also finds words like amharc (meaning \\"to look\\" and pronounced \\"onk\\"), nimhneach (painful or sore), druid (close), mothaigh (hear), doiligh (difficult), ~r (new), and tig le (to be able to ÿ i.e. a form similar to fidir).\\r\\nIrish President Douglas Hyde was possibly one of the last speakers of the Roscommon dialect of Irish.[51]\\r\\nLinguistically the most important of the Ulster dialects today is that of the Rosses (na Rossa), which has been used extensively in literature by such authors as the brothers Samus ܇?Grianna and Seosamh Mac?Grianna, locally known as Jim Fheilim and Joe Fheilim. This dialect is essentially the same as that in Gweedore (Gaoth Dobhair = Inlet of Streaming Water), and used by native singers Enya (Eithne) and Moya Brennan and their siblings in Clannad (Clann as Dobhar = Family from the Dobhar [a section of Gweedore]) Na Casaidigh, and Mairad N Mhaonaigh from another local band Altan.\\r\\nUlster Irish sounds very different and shares several features with southern dialects of Scottish Gaelic and Manx, as well as having lots of characteristic words and shades of meanings. However, since the demise of those Irish dialects spoken natively in what is today Northern Ireland, it is probably an exaggeration to see present-day Ulster Irish as an intermediary form between Scottish Gaelic and the southern and western dialects of Irish. Northern Scottish Gaelic has many non-Ulster features in common with Munster Irish.\\r\\nOne noticeable trait of Ulster Irish, Manx Gaelic and Scots Gaelic is the use of the negative particle cha(n) in place of the Munster and Connacht n. Though southern Ulster Irish tends to use n more than cha(n), cha(n) has almost ousted n in northernmost dialects (e.g. Rosguill and Tory Island), though even in these areas nl \\"is not\\" is more common than chan fhuil or cha bhfuil.[52][53]\\r\\nAnother noticeable trait is the pronunciation of the first person singular verb ending -im as -am, also common to Ulster, Man and Scotland (Munster/Connacht/Leinster si~laim \\"I walk\\", Ulster si~lam).\\r\\nIrish was spoken as a community language in Irish towns and cities down to the 19th century. In the 16th and 17th centuries it was widespread even in Dublin and the Pale.[54]\\r\\nThe Irish of Dublin, situated as it was between the east Ulster dialect of Meath and Louth to the north and the Leinster-Connacht dialect further south, may have reflected the characteristics of both in phonology and grammar. In County Dublin itself the general rule was to place the stress on the initial vowel of words. With time it appears that the forms of the dative case took over the other case endings in the plural (a tendency found to a lesser extent in other dialects). In a letter written in Dublin in 1691 we find such examples as the following: gn܇thuimh (accusative case, the standard form being gn܇tha), torthuibh (accusative case, the standard form being tortha) and leithscalaibh (genitive case, the standard form being leithscalta).[55]\\r\\nEnglish authorities of the Cromwellian period, aware that Irish was widely spoken in Dublin, arranged for its official use. In 1655 several local dignitaries were ordered to oversee a lecture in Irish to be given in Dublin. In March 1656 a converted Catholic priest, Samas Corcy, was appointed to preach in Irish at Brides parish every Sunday, and was also ordered to preach at Drogheda and Athy.[56] In 1657 the English colonists in Dublin presented a petition to the Municipal Council complaining that in Dublin itself \\"there is Irish commonly and usually spoken\\".[57]\\r\\nThere is contemporary evidence of the use of Irish in other urban areas at the time. In 1657 it was found necessary to have an Oath of Abjuration (rejecting the authority of the Pope) read in Irish in Cork so that people could understand it.[58]\\r\\nIrish was sufficiently strong in early 18th century Dublin to be the language of a coterie of poets and scribes led by Sen and Tadhg ܇ Neachtain, both poets of note.[59] Scribal activity in Irish persisted in Dublin right through the 18th century. An outstanding example was Muiris ܇ Gormin (Maurice Gorman), a prolific producer of manuscripts who advertised his services (in English) in Faulkner's Dublin Journal.[60]\\r\\nIn other urban centres the descendants of medieval Anglo-Norman settlers, the so-called Old English, were Irish-speaking or bilingual by the 16th century.[61] The English administrator and traveller Fynes Moryson, writing in the last years of the 16th century, said that \\"the English Irish and the very citizens (excepting those of Dublin where the lord deputy resides) though they could speak English as well as we, yet commonly speak Irish among themselves, and were hardly induced by our familiar conversation to speak English with us\\".[62] The demise of native cultural institutions in the seventeenth century saw the social prestige of Irish diminish, and the gradual Anglicisation of the middle classes followed.[63]\\r\\nThe census of 1851 showed that the towns and cities of Munster still had significant Irish-speaking populations. In 1819 James McQuige, a veteran Methodist lay preacher in Irish, wrote: \\"In some of the largest southern towns, Cork, Kinsale and even the Protestant town of Bandon, provisions are sold in the markets, and cried in the streets, in Irish\\".[64] Irish speakers constituted over 40% of the population of Cork even in 1851.[48]\\r\\nThe 19th century saw a reduction in the number of Dublins Irish speakers, in keeping with the trend elsewhere. This continued until the end of the century, when the Gaelic revival saw the creation of a strong Irishÿspeaking network, typically united by various branches of the Conradh na Gaeilge, and accompanied by renewed literary activity.[65] By the 1930s Dublin had a lively literary life in Irish.[66]\\r\\nUrban Irish has been the beneficiary, over the last few decades, of a rapidly expanding independent school system, known generally as Gaelscoileanna. These schools teach entirely through Irish, and there are over thirty in Dublin alone.\\r\\nIt is likely that the number of urban native speakers (i.e. people who were born into Irish-speaking households and educated through Irish) is on the increase. It has been suggested that Ireland's towns and cities are acquiring a critical mass of Irish speakers, reflected in the expansion of Irish language media.[67] Colloquial urban Irish is changing in unforeseen ways, with attention being drawn to the rapid loss of consonantal mutations (which are intrinsic to the language). It is presently uncertain whether the urban Irish of non-native speakers will become a dialect in its own right or grow further apart from native Gaeltacht Irish and become a creole (i.e. a new language).[67]\\r\\nAn Caighden Oifigi~il (\\"The Official Standard\\"), often shortened to An Caighden, is the standard language, which is taught in most schools in Ireland, though with strong influences from local dialects. It was published by the translators in Dil ireann in the 1950s.[68]\\r\\nIts development in the 1950s and 1960s had two purposes. One was to simplify Irish spelling, which had retained its Classical spelling, by removing many silent letters, and to give a standard written form that was mutually intelligible by speakers with different dialects.[68] Many aspects of the Caighden are essentially those of Connacht Irish; this is because this is the \\"central\\" dialect which forms a \\"bridge\\", as it were, between the North and South. In practice, dialect speakers pronounce words as in their own dialect; the spelling reflects the pronunciation of Classical Irish. For example, ceann \\"head\\" in early modern Irish was pronounced [cen??]. The spelling has been retained, but the word is variously pronounced [caun?] in the South, [c?n?] in Connacht, and [c?n??] in the North. Beag \\"small\\" was [b??] in early modern Irish, and is now [b??] in Waterford Irish; [b??] in Cork-Kerry Irish; varies between [b??] and [b??] in the West; and is [b??] in the North.\\r\\nThe simplification was weighted in favour of the Western dialect. For example, the early modern Irish leaba, dative case leabaidh [l?eb???] \\"bed\\" is pronounced [l?ab??] as well as [l?ab???] in Waterford Irish, [l?ab???] in Cork-Kerry Irish, [l??b??] in Connacht Irish ([l???b??] in Cois Fharraige Irish) and [l??b?i] in the North.[Not clear whether these pronunciations are for the nominative or the dative case.] Native speakers from the North and South may consider that leabaidh should be the representation in the Caighden rather than the actual leaba. However, leaba is the historically correct nominative form and arguably preferable to the historically incorrect yet common use of the dative form for the nominative.\\r\\nOn the other hand, in some cases the Caighden retained classical spellings even though none of the dialects had retained the corresponding pronunciation. For example, it has retained the Classical Irish spelling of ar (\\"on\\", \\"for\\", etc.) and ag (\\"at\\", \\"by\\", \\"of\\", etc.). The first is pronounced [???] throughout the Goidelic-speaking world (and is written er in Manx, and air in Scottish Gaelic), and should[clarification needed] be written either eir or oir in Irish. The second is pronounced [i?] in the South, and [e?] in the North and West. Again, Manx and Scottish Gaelic reflect this pronunciation much more clearly than Irish does (Manx ec, Scottish aig).\\r\\nIn many cases, however, the Caighden can only refer to the Classical language, in that every dialect is different, as for example in the personal forms of ag.\\r\\nThe second purpose was to create a grammatically regularised or \\"simplified\\" standard which would make the language more accessible for the majority English-speaking school population. In part this is why the Caighden is not universally respected by native speakers. Native speakers traditionally spoke their own dialect (or the Classical dialect if they had knowledge of that). Of course, the simplification of Irish was not the original aim of the developers, who rather saw the Caighden as a means of easing second-language learners into the task of learning \\"full\\" Irish. The Caighden verb system is a prime example, with the reduction in irregular verb forms and personal forms of the verb ÿ except for the first person.\\r\\nThe Caighden, in general, is used by non-native speakers, frequently from the capital, and is sometimes also called \\"Dublin Irish\\" or \\"Urban Irish\\". As it is taught in many Irish-language schools (where Irish is the main, or sometimes only, medium of instruction), it is also sometimes called \\"Gaelscoil Irish\\". The so-called \\"Belfast Irish\\", spoken in that city's Gaeltacht Quarter, is the Caighden heavily influenced by Ulster Irish and Belfast English.\\r\\nThe differences between dialects are considerable, and have led to recurrent difficulties in defining standard Irish. In recent decades contacts between speakers of different dialects have become more frequent and the differences between the dialects are less noticeable.[69]\\r\\nAs of August 2012,[70] the first major revision of the Caighden Oifigi~il is available, both online[71] and in print.[72] Among the changes to be found in the revised version are, for example, various attempts to bring the recommendations of the Caighden closer to the spoken dialect of Gaeltacht speakers,[73] including allowing further use of the nominative case where the genitive would historically have been found.[74]\\r\\nIn pronunciation, Irish most closely resembles its nearest relatives, Scottish Gaelic and Manx. One notable feature is that consonants (except /h/) come in pairs, one \\"broad\\" (velarised, pronounced with the back of the tongue pulled back towards the soft palate) and one \\"slender\\" (palatalised, pronounced with the middle of the tongue pushed up towards the hard palate). While broadÿslender pairs are not unique to Irish (being found, for example, in Russian), in Irish they have a grammatical function.\\r\\nDiphthongs: i?, u?, ?i, ?u.\\r\\nIrish is a fusional, VSO, nominative-accusative language. Irish is neither verb nor satellite framed, and makes liberal use of deictic verbs.\\r\\nNouns decline for 3 numbers: singular, dual, plural; 2 genders: masculine, feminine; and 4 cases: ainmneach (nominative and accusative), gairmeach (vocative), ginideach (genitive), and tabharthach (prepositional). Adjectives agree with nouns in number, gender, and case. Adjectives generally follow nouns, though some precede or prefix nouns. Demonstrative adjectives have proximal, medial, and distal forms. The prepositional case is called the dative by convention.\\r\\nVerbs conjugate for 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects: simple, habitual; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; relative forms; and in some verbs, independent and dependent forms. Verbs conjugate for 3 persons and an impersonal form in which no agent can be determined. There are two verbs for \\"to be\\", one for inherent qualities, and one for transient qualities. The passive voice and many other forms are periphrastic. There are number of preverbal particles marking the negative, interrogative, subjunctive, relative clauses, etc. There is a verbal noun, and verbal adjective. Verb forms are highly regular, many grammars recognise only 11 irregular verbs.\\r\\nPrepositions inflect for person and number. Different prepositions govern different cases. Some prepositions govern different cases depending on intended semantics. The word ag (at), becomes agam (at me) in the first person singular. When used with the verb b (to be), ag indicates possession. Irish shares this attribute with Russian.\\r\\nNumerals have 4 forms: abstract, impersonal, personal, and ordinal.\\r\\nIn Irish, there are two classes of initial consonant mutations, which express grammatical relationship and meaning in verbs, nouns and adjectives:\\r\\nMutations are often the only way to distinguish grammatical forms. For example, the only non-contextual way to distinguish possessive pronouns \\"her,\\" \\"his\\" and \\"their\\", is through initial mutations since all meanings are represented by the same word a.\\r\\nDue to initial mutation, prefixes, clitics, suffixes, root inflection, ending morphology, elision, sandhi, epinthesis, and assimilation; the beginning, core, and end of words can each change radically and even simultaneously depending on context.\\r\\nModern Irish traditionally used the ISO basic Latin alphabet without the letters j, k, q, w, x, y and z, but with the addition of one diacritic sign, the acute accent (   ܇ ~), known in Irish as the sneadh fada (\\"long mark\\"; plural: snte fada). However, some gaelicised words use those letters: for instance, 'Jeep' is written as 'Jp' (the letter v has been naturalised into the language, although it is not part of the traditional alphabet, and has the same pronunciation as \\"bh\\"). In idiomatic English usage, this diacritic is frequently referred to simply as the fada, where the adjective is used as a noun. The fada serves to lengthen the sound of the vowels and in some cases also changes their quality. For example, in Munster Irish (Kerry), a is /a/ or // and  is /?/ in \\"father\\" but in Ulster Irish (Donegal),  tends to be /??/.\\r\\nTraditional orthography had an additional diacritic?ÿ a dot over some consonants to indicate lenition. In modern Irish, the letter h suffixed to a consonant indicates that the consonant is lenited. Thus, for example, 'Gaela?' has become 'Gaelach'.\\r\\nAround the time of the Second World War, Samas Dalt~n, in charge of Rann܇g an Aistri~chin (the official translations department of the Irish government), issued his own guidelines about how to standardise Irish spelling and grammar. This de facto standard was subsequently approved by the State and called the Official Standard or Caighden Oifigi~il. It simplified and standardised the orthography. Many words had silent letters removed and vowel combination brought closer to the spoken language. Where multiple versions existed in different dialects for the same word, one or more were selected.\\r\\nExamples:\\r\\nThe standard spelling does not necessarily reflect the pronunciation used in particular dialects. For example, in standard Irish, bia, \\"food\\", has the genitive bia. In Munster Irish, however, the genitive is pronounced /b?i??/.[75] For this reason, the spelling biadh is still used by the speakers of some dialects, in particular those that show a meaningful and audible difference between biadh (nominative case) and bdh (genitive case) \\"of food, food's\\". In Munster the latter spelling regularly produces the pronunciation /b?i??/ because final -idh, -igh regularly delenites to -ig in Munster pronunciation. Another example would be the word crua, meaning \\"hard\\". This pronounced /kru??/[76] in Munster, in line with the pre-Caighden spelling, cruaidh. In Munster, ao is pronounced /e?/ and aoi pronounced /i?/,[77] but the new spellings of saoghal, \\"life, world\\", genitive: saoghail, have become saol, genitive saoil. This produces irregularities in the match-up between the spelling and pronunciation in Munster, because the word is pronounced /s?e?l??/, genitive /s?e?l?/.[78]\\r\\nThe dot-above diacritic, called a ponc simhithe or s buailte (often shortened to buailte), derives from the punctum delens used in medieval manuscripts to indicate deletion, similar to crossing out unwanted words in handwriting today. From this usage it was used to indicate the lenition of s (from /s/ to /h/) and f (from /f/ to zero) in Old Irish texts.\\r\\nLenition of c, p, and t was indicated by placing the letter h after the affected consonant; lenition of other sounds was left unmarked. Later both methods were extended to be indicators of lenition of any sound except l and n, and two competing systems were used: lenition could be marked by a buailte or by a postposed h. Eventually, use of the buailte predominated when texts were written using Gaelic letters, while the h predominated when writing using Roman letters.\\r\\nToday, Gaelic type and the buailte are rarely used except where a \\"traditional\\" style is required, e.g. the motto on the University College Dublin coat of arms[citation needed] or the symbol of the Irish Defence Forces, The Irish Defence Forces cap badge (܇glai? na h-ireann). Letters with the buailte are available in Unicode and Latin-8 character sets (see Latin Extended Additional chart).[79]","input":"Where is irish spoken as a first language?"},{"output":"Mount Whitney","context":"The following sortable table comprises the 200 highest mountain peaks of the United States with at least 500 meters (1640 feet) of topographic prominence.[1]\\r\\nThe summit of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:\\r\\nIn the United States, only Denali exceeds 6000 meters (19,685 feet) elevation.

She had an older brother, Bertram Vere Dean, born 21 May 1910. She never married and had no children.[3] Her father died on the Titanic; her mother died on 16 September 1975, aged 96; and her brother died on 14 April 1992, age 81, the 80th anniversary of the iceberg collision.\\r\\n\\r\\nDean's parents decided to leave the United Kingdom and emigrate to Wichita, Kansas, where her father had relatives, and his cousin owned a tobacco shop that he was going to co-own.[4] They were not supposed to be aboard the Titanic, but due to a coal strike, they were transferred onto it and boarded it as third-class passengers at Southampton, England. Dean was barely two months old when she boarded the ship. Her father felt its collision with the iceberg on the night of 14 April 1912, and after investigating, returned to his cabin, telling his wife to dress the children and go up on deck. Dean, her mother, and her brother were placed in Lifeboat 10 and were among the first third-class passengers to escape.[i] Her father, however, did not survive, and his body, if recovered, was never identified.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, Dean's mother wanted to continue on to Kansas to fulfil her husband's wish of a new life in the United States. However, after losing him and being left with two small children for whom to care, they returned to Britain aboard the RMS?Adriatic. While aboard the ship, Dean attracted considerable attention. An article in the Daily Mirror dated 12 May 1912 described the ordeal:\\r\\n\\r\\nMillvina and Bertram were raised mostly on pension funds and educated in Southampton schools, including The Gregg School. It was not until she was eight years old, and her mother was planning to remarry, that Dean was told she had been a passenger on the Titanic.\\r\\n\\r\\nDean worked for the British government during the Second World War and later as a purchaser for a local engineering firm. Other careers she held were as a cartographer, a secretary, and an assistant to a tobacconist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until Dean was in her seventies that she became involved in Titanic-related events. Over the years, she participated in numerous conventions, exhibitions, documentaries, radio and television interviews, and personal correspondence. In 1998, she travelled to the United States to participate in a Titanic convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, and another in 1999 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She had also been scheduled to appear at a commemoration of the 94th anniversary of the sinking in 2006, but a broken hip prevented her appearance.[6] She also appeared in the History special Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2007, Dean became the last Titanic survivor following the death of Barbara West Dainton, who died at age 96 in England.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2007, Dean criticised the BBC and its television programme Doctor Who for including an episode with a starship \\"cruise liner\\" called the Titanic, that was similar in appearance to the historical liner. Speaking from her nursing home, she said: \\"The Titanic was a tragedy which tore so many families apart. I lost my father and he lies on that wreck. I think it is disrespectful to make entertainment of such a tragedy.\\"[8] A spokeswoman for the show said: \\"No offence was intended. 'Voyage of the Damned' is set on a spaceship called The Titanic and not a boat.\\"[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2008, Dean had accepted an invitation to speak in Southampton at an event commemorating the 96th anniversary of the sinking, but ill health resulting from a respiratory infection forced her to cancel.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2008, at age 96, Dean was forced to sell several of her family's possessions to pay for her private medical care following a broken hip. These included a letter sent to her mother from the Titanic Relief Fund, and a suitcase given to her and her mother in New York following the sinking. Their sale raised approximately S32,000. In February 2009, she announced that she would be selling several more items to pay for her increasing medical costs which she said exceeded S3,000 a month.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nDean died of pneumonia on the morning of 31 May 2009, 97 years and seven weeks after the Titanic sailed, at a care home in Ashurst, Hampshire.[2][11] She was cremated, and on 24 October 2009, her ashes were scattered from a launch at the docks in Southampton where the Titanic set sail.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the escalating cost of Dean's healthcare, The Millvina Fund was set up in April 2009 by the Belfast, British, and International Titanic Societies with the exclusive aim of taking care of her nursing home bills. It was given a boost by the Irish author and campaigning journalist, Don Mullan, at the opening of his worldwide Nokia photographic exhibition, A Thousand Reasons for Living, (featuring a portrait of Dean) in Dublin on 22 April 2009.[13] Mullan introduced an additional portrait of Dean's hands, as she signed a card for a Titanic autograph collector, which he produced as a limited edition of 100 copies. He made the edition available at ?500 each and then challenged the director and stars of the film Titanic (1997) - James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet - singer Celine Dion, and the corporations Sony Music, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount Pictures to match him euro-for-euro to support her with her bills.[14][15] DiCaprio and Winslet led the way with a joint contribution of US$20,000. Cameron and Dion donated US$10,000 each.","input":"Who was the last living survivor of the titanic disaster?"},{"output":"April 12, 1929","context":"Arches National Park is a United States National Park in eastern Utah. The park is adjacent to the Colorado River, 4 miles (6?km) north of Moab, Utah. It is home to over 2,000 natural sandstone arches, including the world-famous Delicate Arch, in addition to a variety of unique geological resources and formations. It contains the highest density of natural arches in the world.[3][4]\\r\\nThe park consists of 76,679 acres (119.811?sq?mi; 31,031?ha; 310.31?km2) of high desert located in the Colorado Plateau.[5] Its highest elevation is 5,653 feet (1,723?m) at Elephant Butte, and its lowest elevation is 4,085 feet (1,245?m) at the visitor center. Forty-three arches are known to have collapsed since 1977. The park receives on average 10 inches (250?mm) of rain a year.\\r\\nAdministered by the National Park Service, the area was originally named a National Monument on April 12, 1929. It was redesignated as a National Park on November 12, 1971.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe national park lies atop an underground evaporite layer or salt bed, which is the main cause of the formation of the arches, spires, balanced rocks, sandstone fins, and eroded monoliths in the area. This salt bed is thousands of feet thick in places, and was deposited in the Paradox Basin of the Colorado Plateau some 300 million years ago when a sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated. Over millions of years, the salt bed was covered with debris eroded from the Uncompahgre Uplift to the northeast. During the Early Jurassic (about 210 Ma) desert conditions prevailed in the region and the vast Navajo Sandstone was deposited. An additional sequence of stream laid and windblown sediments, the Entrada Sandstone (about 140 Ma), was deposited on top of the Navajo. Over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) of younger sediments were deposited and have been mostly eroded away. Remnants of the cover exist in the area including exposures of the Cretaceous Mancos Shale. The arches of the area are developed mostly within the Entrada formation.[7]\\r\\nThe weight of this cover caused the salt bed below it to liquefy and thrust up layers of rock into salt domes. The evaporites of the area formed more unusual salt anticlines or linear regions of uplift.[7] Faulting occurred and whole sections of rock subsided into the areas between the domes. In some places, they turned almost on edge. The result of one such 2,500-foot (760?m) displacement, the Moab Fault, is seen from the visitor center.\\r\\nAs this subsurface movement of salt shaped the landscape, erosion removed the younger rock layers from the surface. Except for isolated remnants, the major formations visible in the park today are the salmon-colored Entrada Sandstone, in which most of the arches form, and the buff-colored Navajo Sandstone. These are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park. Over time, water seeped into the surface cracks, joints, and folds of these layers. Ice formed in the fissures, expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock, breaking off bits and pieces. Winds later cleaned out the loose particles. A series of free-standing fins remained. Wind and water attacked these fins until, in some, the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock tumbled out. Many damaged fins collapsed. Others, with the right degree of hardness and balance, survived despite their missing sections. These became the famous arches.\\r\\nAlthough the park's terrain may appear rugged and durable, it is extremely fragile. More than 1 million visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem.[8] The problem lies within the soil's crust which is composed of cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, and lichens that grow in the dusty parts of the park. Factors that make Arches National Park sensitive to visitor damage include: semiarid region, and the scarce, unpredictable rainfall, lack of deep freezing, and lack of plant litter which results in soils that have both a low resistance to, and slow recovery from, compressional forces such as foot traffic. Methods of indicating effects on the soil are cytophobic soil crust index, measuring of water infiltration, and t-tests that are used to compare the values from the undisturbed and disturbed areas.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHumans have occupied the region since the last ice age 10,000 years ago. Fremont people and Ancient Pueblo People lived in the area up until about 700 years ago. Spanish missionaries encountered Ute and Paiute tribes in the area when they first came through in 1775, but the first European-Americans to attempt settlement in the area were the Mormon Elk Mountain Mission in 1855, who soon abandoned the area. Ranchers, farmers, and prospectors later settled Moab in the neighboring Riverine Valley in the 1880s. Word of the beauty of the surrounding rock formations spread beyond the settlement as a possible tourist destination.\\r\\nThe Arches area was first brought to the attention of the National Park Service by Frank A. Wadleigh, passenger traffic manager of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. Wadleigh, accompanied by railroad photographer George L. Beam, visited the area in September 1923 at the invitation of Alexander Ringhoffer, a Hungarian-born prospector living in Salt Valley. Ringhoffer had written to the railroad in an effort to interest them in the tourist potential of a scenic area he had discovered the previous year with his two sons and a son-in-law, which he called the \\"Devil's Garden\\" (known today as the \\"Klondike Bluffs\\"). Wadleigh was impressed by what Ringhoffer showed him, and suggested to Park Service director Stephen T. Mather that the area be made a national monument.\\r\\nThe following year, additional support for the monument idea came from Laurence Gould, a University of Michigan graduate student (and future polar explorer) studying the geology of the nearby La Sal Mountains, who was shown the scenic area by local physician Dr. J. W. \\"Doc\\" Williams.\\r\\nA succession of government investigators examined the area, in part due to confusion as to the precise location. In the process, the name \\"Devil's Garden\\" was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley, and Ringhoffer's original discovery was omitted, while another area nearby, known locally as \\"The Windows\\", was included. Designation of the area as a national monument was supported by the Park Service from 1926, but was resisted by President Calvin Coolidge's Interior Secretary, Hubert Work. Finally in April 1929, shortly after his inauguration, President Herbert Hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating Arches National Monument, consisting of two comparatively small, disconnected sections. The purpose of the reservation under the 1906 Antiquities Act was to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name \\"Arches\\" was suggested by Frank Pinkely, superintendent of the Park Service's southwestern national monuments, following a visit to the Windows section in 1925.\\r\\nIn late 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a proclamation which enlarged Arches to protect additional scenic features and permit development of facilities to promote tourism. A small adjustment was made by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1960 to accommodate a new road alignment.\\r\\nIn early 1969, just before leaving office, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a proclamation substantially enlarging Arches. Two years later, President Richard Nixon signed legislation enacted by Congress which significantly reduced the total area enclosed, but changed its status to a National Park.\\r\\nClimbing on named arches within the park has long been banned by park regulations. Following Dean Potter's successful free climb on the Delicate Arch in May 2006, however, the wording of the regulations was deemed unenforceable by the park attorney. The park revised its regulations as follows in response:\\r\\nAll rock climbing or similar activities on any arch or natural bridge named on the United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute topographical maps covering Arches National Park are prohibited.[11]\\r\\nClimbing on other features in the park is allowed, but regulated. The revised regulations also prohibit slacklining parkwide. Approved recreational activities include auto touring, backpacking, biking, camping, and hiking, some of which require permits. Guided commercial tours and ranger programs are also available.\\r\\nAstronomy is also popular in the park due to its dark skies despite the increasing light pollution from towns like Moab.[12][13]\\r\\nAmerican writer Edward Abbey was a park ranger at Arches National Monument where he kept journals that became his book Desert Solitaire. The success of this book, as well as the rise in adventure-based recreation, has drawn many hikers, mountain-bikers, and off-road enthusiasts to the area, but activities are limited within park boundaries: camping, foot hiking (along designated trails), and driving only along marked roads. The Hayduke Trail, an 825-mile (1,328?km) backpacking route named after one of Edward Abbey's characters, begins in the park.\\r\\nArches National Park was used as one of the filming locations for the 1965 biblical epic film, The Greatest Story Ever Told.\\r\\nPortions of The Windows section of Arches National Park were used as locations in the 1989 film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\\r\\nArches National Park is the subject of the third 2014 quarter scheduled as part of the U.S. Mint's America the Beautiful quarters coin program commemorating national parks and historic sites.\\r\\nThere is an abundance of wildlife in Arches. The list includes: spadefoot toad, antelope squirrel, scrub jay, peregrine falcon, many kinds of sparrows, red fox, desert bighorn sheep, kangaroo rat, mule deer, cougar, midget faded rattlesnake, yucca moth, many types of cyanobacteria, Western rattlesnake, and the Western collared lizard.[14]\\r\\nPlants also dominate the landscape in the park. The list of plants includes: prickly pear cactus, Indian ricegrass, bunch grasses, cheatgrass, lichen, moss, liverworts, Utah juniper, Mormon tea, blackbrush, cliffrose, four-winged saltbrush, pinyon pine, stemless woollybase, evening primrose, sand verbena, yucca, and sacred datura.[15]\\r\\nAmong the notable features of the park are:\\r\\nView at the entrance of the Park\\r\\nBalanced Rock\\r\\nBalanced Rock During Winter\\r\\nDark Angel\\r\\nDelicate Arch, one of the most famous arches in the world\\r\\nThe Delicate Arch through Frame Arch\\r\\nThe Double Arch\\r\\nDouble O Arch\\r\\nSuperior arch of Double O Arch\\r\\nLandscape Arch\\r\\nSkyline Arch\\r\\nNorth Window as viewed from Windows Trails\\r\\nPine Tree Arch\\r\\nTunnel Arch","input":"When did arches national park became a national park?"},{"output":"equivalent to able seaman in the Royal Navy, aircraftman, leading aircraftman and senior aircraftman in the Royal Air Force, and marine (Mne) or bandsman","context":"A private is a soldier of the lowest military rank (equivalent to NATO Rank Grades OR-1 to OR-3 depending on the force served in).\\r\\nIn modern military parlance, \\"private\\" is shortened to \\"Pte\\" in the United Kingdom and other (Commonwealth of Nations) countries and to \\"Pvt.\\" in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term derives from the medieval term \\"private soldiers\\" (a term still used in the British Army), denoting individuals who were either hired, conscripted, or mustered into service by a feudal nobleman commanding a battle group of an army. The usage of \\"private\\" dates from the 18th century.\\r\\nIn the Israel Defense Forces, ????? Turai (\\"private\\") refers to the lowest enlisted rank. After 7ÿ10 months of service (7 for combatants, 8 for combat support and 10 for non-combatants) soldiers are promoted from private to corporal (rav-turai or rabat), if they performed their duties appropriately during this time. Soldiers who take a commander's course, are prisoner instructors or practical engineers become corporals earlier. An IDF private wears no uniform insignia and is sometimes described as having a \\"slick sleeve\\" for this reason.\\r\\nThe equivalent ranks to privates within the North and South Korean armies are il-byong(private first class) and e-byong(private second class). The symbol for this rank is 1 line ( | ) or 2 lines ( || ). Private second class is known by 1 line, while private first class is 2 lines.\\r\\nOnce recruits complete their Basic Military Training (BMT) or Basic Rescue Training (BRT), they attain the rank of private (PTE). Privates (l) do not wear ranks on their rank holder. PTEs who performed well are promoted to the rank of Private First Class (PFC). The PFC rank insignia is a single chevron pointing downward.[1]\\r\\nIn Indonesia, this rank is referred to as Tamtama (specifically Prajurit), which is the lowest rank in the Indonesian Armed Forces and special Police Force. In the Indonesian Army, \\"Private\\" has three levels, which are: Private (Prajurit Dua), Private First Class (Prajurit Satu), and Master Private (Prajurit Kepala). After this rank, it is promoted the rank: Corporal.\\r\\nPrivate (Prajurit Dua)\\r\\nPrivate First Class (Prajurit Satu)\\r\\nMaster Private (Prajurit Kepala)\\r\\nIn the Australian Army, a soldier of private rank wears no insignia.[2] Like its British Army counterpart, the Australian Army rank of private (PTE) has other titles, depending on the corps and specification of that service member.\\r\\nThe following alternative ranks are available for privates in the Australian Army:\\r\\nPrivate is the lowest rank in the Canadian Forces for members who wear army uniform. There are three levels of private: private (recruit), private (basic), and private (trained). All persons holding the rank of private are referred to as such and the qualifier shown in brackets is used on employment records only. A private is considered an \\"apprentice\\" in their trade, and there are no pay raises between the various levels of private except for time in rank raise.\\r\\nFor members who wear air force uniform, the rank is called aviator and is also broken into three levels: aviator (recruit), aviator (basic) and aviator (trained). The insignia for aviator (trained) is a propeller.\\r\\nArmy privates may be known by other titles, depending on unit and personnel branch:\\r\\nFor members who wear navy uniform the equivalents are:\\r\\nIn the Indian Army and Pakistan Army the lowest enlisted rank is sepoy (/?si?p??/), literally meaning \\"soldier\\" derived from Persian. A sepoy does not wear any rank insignia on his uniform.\\r\\nIn the British Army, a private (Pte) equates to both OR-1 and OR-2 on the NATO scale, although there is no difference in rank. Privates wear no insignia. Many regiments and corps use other distinctive and descriptive names instead of private, some of these ranks have been used for centuries, others are less than 100 years old.[3] In the contemporary British Armed Forces, the army rank of private is broadly equivalent to able seaman in the Royal Navy, aircraftman, leading aircraftman and senior aircraftman in the Royal Air Force, and marine (Mne) or bandsman, as appropriate equivalent rank in the Royal Marines. Also in the Boys Brigade the rank of private is used when a boy moves from the junior section to the company section.\\r\\nNotably, both Sir Fitzroy Maclean and Enoch Powell are examples of rare, rapid career progression with the British Army, both rising from the rank of private to at least brigadier during World War II.\\r\\nDistinctive equivalents for private include:\\r\\nThe lowest rank in the Austrian Armed Forces is the Rekrut (literally Recruit). For recruits in training to become non-commissioned or commissioned officers the rank bears an additional silver crossbar.\\r\\nUp until 1998 the rank was called Wehrmann. In 2017 the silver crossbar was removed, as the system of the 'officers career' changed.\\r\\nThe equivalent rank to private in the Spanish, Mexican, Colombian, Dominican and Argentinian army is the soldado raso meaning \\"rankless soldier\\" or simply soldado.\\r\\nOn enlistment in the Belgian army one is given the rank of soldaat (Dutch) or soldat (French), whether one wishes to be a volunteer, non-commissioned officer or officer. Subsequent rank depends on the branch of the service: for example, at the Royal Military Academy (for officer training) one is soon promoted to the rank of corporaal (Dutch) or caporal (French) i.e. \\"corporal\\". The insignia is a simple black mark.\\r\\nSoldado is the rank equivalent to private in the Brazilian and Portuguese Armed Forces. Soldado means \\"soldier\\" in Portuguese.\\r\\nThe Finnish equivalent rank is sotamies (literally \\"war man\\"), although since 1973 this has been purely a paper term as all infantry troopers were renamed as j??k?ri troops, previously reserved only to mobile light infantry. As in the British army, the various branches use different names:\\r\\nIn the Finnish Air Force, the basic rank is lentosotamies (\\"flight war man\\"). In the Finnish Navy, the basic rank is matruusi (\\"seaman\\").\\r\\nSpecial corps troopers may be referred by their function or unit, such as kaartinj??k?ri (Guards jaeger), panssarij??k?ri (panzerj?ger), laskuvarjoj??k?ri (paratroop jaeger), rajaj??k?ri (border jaeger) or rannikkoj??k?ri (coastal jaeger).\\r\\nIn the French army soldat de seconde classe is the lowest military rank. This rank is also referred to as recrue (\\"recruit\\").\\r\\nThe German Bundeswehr modern-day equivalent of the private rank (NATO-standard code OR-2) is Gefreiter.\\r\\nThe equivalent of the lowest rank (NATO-standard code OR-1) is either Schtze (rifleman), Kanonier (gunner) or J?ger (light-infantryman otherwise ranger), and sometimes in general simply Soldat (soldier), as well as other unit-specific distinctions.[4] Up until 1918 it was Gemeine[5] (Ordinary [soldier]) as well as unit-specific distinctions such as Musketier (musketeer), Infanterist (infantryman), Krassier (cuirassier), J?ger (light-infantryman otherwise ranger), Fsilier (fusilier) etc., until 1945 Soldat (soldier) and unit-specific distinctions such as Schtze (rifleman), Grenadier (grenadier) etc. The navy equivalent of the OR-1 rank is known as Matrose[4] (sailor or seaman), and the German Air Force equivalent is Flieger[4] (aviator or airman) which is also used by army aviators.\\r\\nSchtze, Kanonier, J?ger rank\\r\\nshoulder epaulette\\r\\nArmy (Heer) uniform jacket\\r\\nSchtze, Kanonier, J?ger rank\\r\\nArmy (Heer) combat uniform\\r\\nFlieger rank\\r\\nAir Force (Luftwaffe) combat uniform\\r\\nSchtze, Kanonier, J?ger Unteroffizieranw?rter (UA) NCO-candidate rank\\r\\nArmy (Heer) combat uniform\\r\\nMatrose rank\\r\\nNavy service uniform\\r\\nThe name of the lowest rank in the Hungarian army (Magyar Honvdsg) is the honvd which means \\"homeland defender\\". The word is also used informally for a soldier in general of any rank (i.e. \\"our honvds\\" or an officer referred as a honvdtiszt, honvd officer). This is because Hungarian military traditions are strictly defensive, despite the Hungarian army participating in offensives on foreign soil in both world wars. The word honvd has been in use since the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.\\r\\nPrivate (Pte) (saighdi~r singil in Irish), is the lowest enlisted rank in the Irish Army. Soldiers enlist as recruits then undergo a basic course of instruction. There are three grades of private in the army. After basic training the soldier is upgraded (rather than promoted) from recruit to private 2 star (Pte 2*) (saighdi~r singil, 2 ralta). After more corps-specific training (usually lasting eight weeks) the soldier is upgraded to private 3 star (Pte 3*) (saighdi~r singil, 3 ralta). All are usually just addressed as \\"private\\", although before being upgraded, recruits may be addressed as \\"recruit\\".\\r\\nIn corps units, the rank designation changes. In the artillery, the rank is known as gunner (Gnr), but usually only after the completion of a gunners' course, and in the cavalry it is known as trooper (Tpr). Communications and Information Services privates are known as signalman or signalwoman. Medical orderlies are sometimes referred to as medic, although this can apply to privates and corporals.\\r\\nIn the Italian Army soldato is the lowest military rank. This rank is also referred to as recluta (meaning recruit). Soldato is the generic term for private. But in many specialized corps this term is never used, as a more specific, corp related, term is preferred. For instance the lowest rank in Alpine troops is alpino, and the lowest rank in the artillery is artigliere. In the air force this is ranked as aviere and in the navy as marinaio.\\r\\nIn the Royal Netherlands Army, the Landmacht, the equivalent ranks are soldaat (soldier), similar to the original French, with different classes:\\r\\nDepending on where the soldaat serves, he may be deemed a kanonnier (gunner in the artillery), huzaar (hussar in the cavalry) or fuselier (rifleman in the rifles) as well as commando, jager or rijder. There is less differentiation than in other countries between different armed forces. A soldaat can be promoted to korporaal (corporal).\\r\\nIn the Swiss Armed Forces a recruit is given the rank of Soldat when he finishes basic training, mostly after 13 weeks.\\r\\nIn the Turkish Land Forces, Turkish Air Force and Turkish Naval Forces; Er (Private) is the lowest rank possible. This rank does not have any insignia.\\r\\nIn the U.S. Army, private is used for the two lowest enlisted ranks, just below private first class. The lowest rank is \\"private E-1\\" (PV1) and sometimes referred to as recruit, but also held by some soldiers after punishment through the Uniform Code of Military Justice or prisoners after conviction until they are discharged. A PV1 wears no uniform insignia; since the advent of the Army Combat Uniform, the term \\"fuzzy\\" has come into vogue, referring to the blank velcro patch on the ACU where the rank would normally be placed. The second rank, private E-2 (PV2), wears a single chevron, known colloquially as \\"mosquito wings\\". Advancement to the PV2 is automatic after six months' time in service, but may get shortened to four months if given a waiver. A person who earned the Eagle Scout award, the Gold Award, or completed at least two years of JROTC may enlist at any time at the rank of PV2.[6] The term of address, \\"Private\\", may be properly applied to any Army soldier E-1 (PV1) to E-3 (PFC). It should also be noted that while a soldier is currently in Initial Enlistment Training, he or she will often be referred to as \\"Private\\" by the training cadre, regardless of actual rank, even if the soldier enlisted as a Specialist/E-4.\\r\\nIn the U.S. Marine Corps, private (Pvt) refers only to the lowest enlisted rank, just below private first class. A Marine Corps private wears no uniform insignia and is sometimes described as having a \\"slick sleeve\\" for this reason. Most new, non-officer Marines begin their military career as a private. In the Marine Corps, privates first class are not referred to as \\"private\\"; it is more appropriate to use either \\"private first class\\" or \\"PFC\\".\\r\\nService\\r\\nRoyal Navy\\r\\nRoyal Marines\\r\\nArmy\\r\\nRoyal Air Force\\r\\nOR-1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPte\\r\\nAC\\r\\nOR-2\\r\\nAB\\r\\nMne\\r\\nPte\\r\\nLAC\\r\\nOR-3\\r\\nNot Applicable\\r\\nLCpl\\r\\nLCpl\\r\\nSAC / SAC(T) / LCpl (RAF Regt only)\\r\\nOR-4\\r\\nLH\\r\\nCpl\\r\\nCpl\\r\\nCpl\\r\\nOR-5/OR-6\\r\\nPO\\r\\nSgt\\r\\nSgt\\r\\nSgt\\r\\nOR-7\\r\\nCPO\\r\\nCSgt\\r\\nSSgt / CSgt\\r\\nChf Tech - Flt Sgt\\r\\nOR-8\\r\\n\\r\\nWO2\\r\\nWO2\\r\\nOR-9\\r\\nWO1\\r\\nWO1\\r\\nWO1\\r\\nWO / MAcr","input":"What is a private in the british army?"},{"output":"the first picture of Kylie Jenner's daughter Stormi Webster","context":"This list contains the top 20 pictures with the most likes on the social photo-sharing platform Instagram.

It was during this time that the early chordates developed the skull and the vertebral column, leading to the first craniates and vertebrates. The first fish lineages belong to the Agnatha, or jawless fish. Early examples include Haikouichthys. During the late Cambrian, eel-like jawless fish called the conodonts, and small mostly armoured fish known as ostracoderms, first appeared. Most jawless fish are now extinct; but the extant lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. Lampreys belong to the Cyclostomata, which includes the extant hagfish, and this group may have split early on from other agnathans.\\r\\nThe first jawed vertebrates probably developed during the late Ordovician period. They are first represented in the fossil record from the Silurian by two groups of fish: the armoured fish known as placoderms, which evolved from the ostracoderms; and the Acanthodii (or spiny sharks). The jawed fish that are still extant in modern days also appeared in late Silurian: the Chondrichthyes (or cartilaginous fish) and the Osteichthyes (or bony fish). The bony fish evolved into two separate groups: the Actinopterygii (or ray-finned fish) and Sarcopterygii (which includes the lobe-finned fish).\\r\\nDuring the Devonian period a great increase in fish variety occurred, especially that of the ostracoderms and placoderms, as well as lobe-finned fish and early sharks. This has led to the Devonian being known as the age of fishes. It was from the lobe-finned fish that the tetrapods evolved, the four-limbed vertebrates, represented today by amphibians, mammals, reptiles and birds. Transitional tetrapods first appeared during the early Devonian, and by the late Devonian the first tetrapods appeared. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth; but it is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors. Fish do not represent a monophyletic group, but a paraphyletic one, as they exclude the tetrapods.[1]\\r\\nFish, like many other organisms, have been greatly affected by extinction events throughout natural history. The OrdovicianÿSilurian extinction events led to the loss of many species. The late Devonian extinction led to the extinction of the ostracoderms and placoderms by the end of the Devonian, as well as other fish. The spiny sharks became extinct at the PermianÿTriassic extinction event; the conodonts became extinct at the TriassicÿJurassic extinction event. The CretaceousÿPaleogene extinction event, and the present day Holocene extinction, have also affected fish variety and fish stocks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConventional classification has living vertebrates as a subphylum grouped into eight classes based on traditional interpretations of gross anatomical and physiological traits. In turn, these classes are grouped into the vertebrates that have four limbs (the tetrapods) and those that do not: fishes. The extant vertebrate classes are:[3]\\r\\nFish may have evolved from an animal similar to a coral-like sea squirt (a tunicate), whose larvae resemble early fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some sea squirts do today), although this path cannot be proven.\\r\\nVertebrates, among them the first fishes, originated about 530 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion, which saw the rise in organism diversity.[4]\\r\\nThe first ancestors of fish, or animals that were probably closely related to fish, were Pikaia, Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia.[8][4] These three genera all appeared around 530 Ma. Pikaia had a primitive notochord, a structure that could have developed into a vertebral column later. Unlike the other fauna that dominated the Cambrian, these groups had the basic vertebrate body plan: a notochord, rudimentary vertebrae, and a well-defined head and tail.[9] All of these early vertebrates lacked jaws in the common sense and relied on filter feeding close to the seabed.[10]\\r\\nThese were followed by indisputable fossil vertebrates in the form of heavily armoured fishes discovered in rocks from the Ordovician Period 500ÿ430 Ma.\\r\\nThe first jawed vertebrates appeared in the late Ordovician and became common in the Devonian, often known as the \\"Age of Fishes\\".[11] The two groups of bony fishes, the actinopterygii and sarcopterygii, evolved and became common.[12] The Devonian also saw the demise of virtually all jawless fishes, save for lampreys and hagfish, as well as the Placodermi, a group of armoured fish that dominated much of the late Silurian. The Devonian also saw the rise of the first labyrinthodonts, which was a transitional between fishes and amphibians.\\r\\nThe colonisation of new niches resulted in diversification of body plans and sometimes an increase in size. The Devonian Period (395 to 345 Ma) brought in such giants as the placoderm Dunkleosteus, which could grow up to seven meters long, and early air-breathing fish that could remain on land for extended periods. Among this latter group were ancestral amphibians.\\r\\nThe reptiles appeared from labyrinthodonts in the subsequent Carboniferous period. The anapsid and synapsid reptiles were common during the late Paleozoic, while the diapsids became dominant during the Mesozoic. In the sea, the bony fishes became dominant.\\r\\nThe later radiations, such as those of fish in the Silurian and Devonian periods, involved fewer taxa, mainly with very similar body plans. The first animals to venture onto dry land were arthropods. Some fish had lungs and strong, bony fins and could crawl onto the land also.\\r\\nJawless fishes belong to the superclass Agnatha in the phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata. Agnatha comes from the Greek, and means \\"no jaws\\".[13] It excludes all vertebrates with jaws, known as gnathostomes. Although a minor element of modern marine fauna, jawless fish were prominent among the early fish in the early Paleozoic. Two types of Early Cambrian animal apparently having fins, vertebrate musculature, and gills are known from the early Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China: Haikouichthys and Myllokunmingia. They have been tentatively assigned to Agnatha by Janvier. A third possible agnathid from the same region is Haikouella. A possible agnathid that has not been formally described was reported by Simonetti from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia.[citation needed]\\r\\nMany Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian agnathians were armoured with heavy bony-spiky plates. The first armoured agnathansthe Ostracoderms, precursors to the bony fish and hence to the tetrapods (including humans)are known from the middle Ordovician, and by the Late Silurian the agnathans had reached the high point of their evolution. Most of the ostracoderms, such as thelodonts, osteostracans, and galeaspids, were more closely related to the gnathostomes than to the surviving agnathans, known as cyclostomes. Cyclostomes apparently split from other agnathans before the evolution of dentine and bone, which are present in many fossil agnathans, including conodonts.[14] Agnathans declined in the Devonian and never recovered.\\r\\nThe agnathans as a whole are paraphyletic,[15] because most extinct agnathans belong to the stem group of gnathostomes.[16][17] Recent molecular data, both from rRNA[18] and from mtDNA[19] strongly supports the theory that living agnathans, known as cyclostomes, are monophyletic.[20] In phylogenetic taxonomy, the relationships between animals are not typically divided into ranks, but illustrated as a nested \\"family tree\\" known as a cladogram. Phylogenetic groups are given definitions based on their relationship to one another, rather than purely on physical traits such as the presence of a backbone. This nesting pattern is often combined with traditional taxonomy, in a practice known as evolutionary taxonomy.\\r\\nThe cladogram below for jawless fish is based on studies compiled by Philippe Janvier and others for the Tree of Life Web Project.[22] (? = group is extinct)\\r\\nHyperoartia (lampreys)\\r\\n??Euconodonta (eel like animals)\\r\\n?Pteraspidomorphi (jawless fishes)\\r\\n??Thelodonti (jawless fishes with scales)\\r\\n??Anaspida (jawless ancestors[23] of lampreys)\\r\\n?Galeaspida (jawless fishes with bone head shields)\\r\\n??Pituriaspida (armoured jawless fishes with large rostrums)\\r\\n?Osteostraci (bony armoured jawless fish with bone head shields)\\r\\nJawed vertebrates L continued in section below\\r\\nConodonts resembled primitive jawless eels. They appeared 495 Ma and were wiped out 200 Ma.[24] Initially they were known only from tooth-like microfossils called conodont elements. These \\"teeth\\" have been variously interpreted as filter-feeding apparatuses or as a \\"grasping and crushing array\\".[25] Conodonts ranged in length from a centimeter to the 40?cm Promissum.[25] Their large eyes had a lateral position, which makes a predatory role unlikely. The preserved musculature hints that some conodonts (Promissum at least) were efficient cruisers but incapable of bursts of speed.[25] In 2012 researchers classified the conodonts in the phylum Chordata on the basis of their fins with fin rays, chevron-shaped muscles and notochord.[26] Some researchers see them as vertebrates similar in appearance to modern hagfish and lampreys,[27] though phylogenetic analysis suggests that they are more derived than either of these groups.[28]\\r\\nOstracoderms (shell-skinned) are armoured jawless fishes of the Paleozoic. The term does not often appear in classifications today because it is paraphyletic or polyphyletic, and has no phylogenetic meaning.[29] However, the term is still used informally to group together the armoured jawless fishes.\\r\\nThe ostracoderm armour consisted of 3ÿ5?mm polygonal plates that shielded the head and gills, and then overlapped further down the body like scales. The eyes were particularly shielded. Earlier chordates used their gills for both respiration and feeding, whereas ostracoderms used their gills for respiration only. They had up to eight separate pharyngeal gill pouches along the side of the head, which were permanently open with no protective operculum. Unlike invertebrates that use ciliated motion to move food, ostracoderms used their muscular pharynx to create a suction that pulled small and slow moving prey into their mouths.\\r\\nThe first fossil fishes that were discovered were ostracoderms. The Swiss anatomist Louis Agassiz received some fossils of bony armored fish from Scotland in the 1830s. He had a hard time classifying them as they did not resemble any living creature. He compared them at first with extant armored fish such as catfish and sturgeons but later realizing that they had no movable jaws, classified them in 1844 into a new group \\"ostracoderms\\".[30]\\r\\nOstracoderms existed in two major groups, the more primitive heterostracans and the cephalaspids. Later, about 420 million years ago, the jawed fish evolved from one of the ostracoderms. After the appearance of jawed fish, most ostracoderm species underwent a decline, and the last ostracoderms became extinct at the end of the Devonian period.[31]\\r\\nThe vertebrate jaw probably originally evolved in the Silurian period and appeared in the Placoderm fish, which further diversified in the Devonian. The two most anterior pharyngeal arches are thought to have become the jaw itself and the hyoid arch, respectively. The hyoid system suspends the jaw from the braincase of the skull, permitting great mobility of the jaws. Already long assumed to be a paraphyletic assemblage leading to more derived gnathostomes, the discovery of Entelognathus suggests that placoderms are directly ancestral to modern bony fish.\\r\\nAs in most vertebrates, fish jaws are bony or cartilaginous and oppose vertically, comprising an upper jaw and a lower jaw. The jaw is derived from the most anterior two pharyngeal arches supporting the gills, and usually bears numerous teeth. The skull of the last common ancestor of today's jawed vertebrates is assumed to have resembled sharks.[32]\\r\\nIt is thought that the original selective advantage garnered by the jaw was not related to feeding, but to increased respiration efficiency. The jaws were used in the buccal pump (observable in modern fish and amphibians) that pumps water across the gills of fish or air into the lungs in the case of amphibians. Over evolutionary time the more familiar use of jaws (to humans), in feeding, was selected for and became a very important function in vertebrates. Many teleost fish have substantially modified their jaws for suction feeding and jaw protrusion, resulting in highly complex jaws with dozens of bones involved.\\r\\nJawed vertebrates and jawed fish evolved from earlier jawless fish, and the cladogram below for jawed vertebrates is a continuation of the cladogram in the section above.

They were mostly wiped out during the Late Devonian Extinction event, 378 Ma, though some survived and made a slight recovery in diversity during the Famennian epoch before dying out entirely at the close of the Devonian, 360 mya; they are ultimately ancestal to modern vertebrates. Their head and thorax were covered with massive and often ornamented armoured plates. The rest of the body was scaled or naked, depending on the species. The armour shield was articulated, with the head armour hinged to the thoratic armour. This allowed placoderms to lift their heads, unlike ostracoderms. Placoderms were the first jawed fish; their jaws likely evolved from the first of their gill arches. The chart on the right shows the rise and demise of the separate placoderm lineages: Acanthothoraci, Rhenanida, Antiarchi, Petalichthyidae, Ptyctodontida and Arthrodira.\\r\\nSpiny sharks, class Acanthodii, are extinct fishes that share features with both bony and cartilaginous fishes, though ultimately more closely related to and ancestral to the latter. Despite being called \\"spiny sharks\\", acanthodians predate sharks, though they gave rise to them. They evolved in the sea at the beginning of the Silurian Period, some 50 million years before the first sharks appeared. Eventually competition from bony fishes proved too much, and the spiny sharks died out in Permian times about 250 Ma. In form they resembled sharks, but their epidermis was covered with tiny rhomboid platelets like the scales of holosteans (gars, bowfins).\\r\\nCartilaginous fishes, class Chondrichthyes, consisting of sharks, rays and chimaeras, appeared by about 395 million years ago, in the middle Devonian, evolving from acanthodians. The class contains the sub classes Holocephali (chimaera) and Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays). The radiation of elasmobranches in the chart on the right is divided into the taxa: Cladoselache, Eugeneodontiformes, Symmoriida, Xenacanthiformes, Ctenacanthiformes, Hybodontiformes, Galeomorphi, Squaliformes and Batoidea.\\r\\nBony fishes, class Osteichthyes, are characterised by bony skeleton rather than cartilage. They appeared in the late Silurian, about 419 million years ago. The recent discovery of Entelognathus strongly suggests that bony fishes (and possibly cartilaginous fishes, via acanthodians) evolved from early placoderms.[34] A subclass of the Osteichthyes, the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), have become the dominant group of fishes in the post-Paleozoic and modern world, with some 30,000 living species.\\r\\nThe bony (and cartilaginous) fish groups that emerged after the Devonian, were characterised by steady improvements in foraging and locomotion.[35]\\r\\nLobe-finned fishes, fish belonging to the class Sarcopterygii, are mostly extinct bony fishes, basally characterised by robust and stubby lobe fins containing a robust internal skeleton, cosmoid scales and internal nostrils. Their fins are fleshy, lobed, paired fins, joined to the body by a single bone.[38] The fins of lobe-finned fish differ from those of all other fish in that each is borne on a fleshy, lobelike, scaly stalk extending from the body. The pectoral and pelvic fins are articulated in ways resembling the tetrapod limbs they were the precursors to. The fins evolved into the legs of the first tetrapod land vertebrates, amphibians. They also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases, as opposed to the single dorsal fin of ray-finned fish. The braincase of lobe-finned fishes primitively has a hinge line, but this is lost in tetrapods and lungfish. Many early lobe-finned fishes have a symmetrical tail. All lobe-finned fishes possess teeth covered with true enamel.\\r\\nLobe-finned fishes, such as coelacanths and lungfish, were the most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian. Taxonomists who subscribe to the cladistic approach include the grouping Tetrapoda within the Sarcopterygii, and the tetrapods in turn include all species of four-limbed vertebrates.[39] The fin-limbs of lobe-finned fishes such as the coelacanths show a strong similarity to the expected ancestral form of tetrapod limbs. The lobe-finned fish apparently followed two different lines of development and are accordingly separated into two subclasses, the Rhipidistia (including the lungfish, and the Tetrapodomorpha, which include the Tetrapoda) and the Actinistia (coelacanths). The first lobe-finned fishes, found in the uppermost Silurian (ca 418 Ma), closely resembled spiny sharks, which became extinct at the end of the Paleozoic. In the earlyÿmiddle Devonian (416 - 385 Ma), while the predatory placoderms dominated the seas, some lobe-finned fishes came into freshwater habitats.\\r\\nIn the Early Devonian (416-397 Ma), the lobe-finned fishes split into two main lineages  the coelacanths and the rhipidistians. The former never left the oceans and their heyday was the Late Devonian and Carboniferous, from 385 to 299 Ma, as they were more common during those periods than in any other period in the Phanerozoic; coelacanths still live today in the oceans (genus Latimeria). The Rhipidistians, whose ancestors probably lived in estuaries, migrated into freshwater habitats. They in turn split into two major groups: the lungfish and the tetrapodomorphs. The lungfish's greatest diversity was in the Triassic period; today there are fewer than a dozen genera left. The lungfish evolved the first proto-lungs and proto-limbs; developing the ability to live outside a water environment in the middle Devonian (397-385 Ma). The first tetrapodomorphs, which included the gigantic rhizodonts, had the same general anatomy as the lungfish, who were their closest kin, but they appear not to have left their water habitat until the late Devonian epoch (385 - 359 Ma), with the appearance of tetrapods (four-legged vertebrates). Tetrapods are the only tetrapodomorphs that survived after the Devonian. Lobe-finned fishes continued until towards the end of Paleozoic era, suffering heavy losses during the Permian-Triassic extinction event (251 Ma).\\r\\nRay-finned fishes, class Actinopterygii, differ from lobe-finned fishes in that their fins consist of webs of skin supported by spines (\\"rays\\") made of bone or horn. There are other differences in respiratory and circulatory structures. Ray-finned fishes normally have skeletons made from true bone, though this is not true of sturgeons and paddlefishes.[42]\\r\\nRay-finned fishes are the dominant vertebrate group, containing half of all known vertebrate species. They inhabit abyssal depths in the sea, coastal inlets and freshwater rivers and lakes, and are a major source of food for humans.[42]\\r\\nPikaia, along with Myllokunmingia and Haikouichthys ercaicunensis immediately below, are all candidates in the fossil record for the titles of \\"first vertebrate\\" and \\"first fish\\". Pikaia is a genus that appeared about 530 Ma during the Cambrian explosion of multicellular life. Pikaia gracilens (pictured) is a transitional fossil between invertebrates and vertebrates,[43] and may be the earliest known chordate.[44][45] In this sense it may have been the original ancestor of fishes. It was a primitive creature with no evidence of eyes, without a well defined head, and less than 2?inches (5 centimetres) long. Pikaia was a sideways-flattened, leaf-shaped animal that swam by throwing its body into a series of S-shaped, zig-zag curves, similar to movement of snakes. Fish inherited the same swimming movement, but they generally have stiffer backbones. It had a pair of large head tentacles and a series of short appendages, which may be linked to gill slits, on either side of its head. Pikaia shows the essential prerequisites for vertebrates. The flattened body is divided into pairs of segmented muscle blocks, seen as faint vertical lines. The muscles lie on either side of a flexible structure resembling a rod that runs from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail.[46]\\r\\nThe Devonian Period is broken into the Early, Middle and Late Devonian. By the start of the Early Devonian 419 mya, jawed fishes had divided into four distinct clades: the placoderms and spiny sharks, both of which are now extinct, and the cartilaginous and bony fishes, both of which are still extant. The modern bony fishes, class Osteichthyes, appeared in the late Silurian or early Devonian, about 416 million years ago. Both the cartilaginous and bony fishes may have arisen from either the placoderms or the spiny sharks. A subclass of bony fishes, the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), have become the dominant group in the post-Paleozoic and modern world, with some 30,000 living species.\\r\\nSea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas were dominated by bryozoa, diverse and abundant brachiopods, the enigmatic hederelloids, microconchids and corals. Lily-like crinoids were abundant, and trilobites were still fairly common. Among vertebrates, jawless armoured fish (ostracoderms) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and fresh water. Armoured placoderms were numerous during the lower stages of the Devonian Period but became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Osteichthyes) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas. The first abundant genus of shark, Cladoselache, appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period. The great diversity of fish around at the time have led to the Devonian being given the name \\"The Age of Fish\\" in popular culture.\\r\\nThe first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish appeared in the Devonian, while the placoderms began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. However, another subclass of Osteichthyes, the Sarcopterygii, including lobe-finned fishes including coelacanths and lungfish) and tetrapods, was the most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian. Sarcopterygians are basally characterized by internal nostrils, lobe fins containing a robust internal skeleton, and cosmoid scales.\\r\\nDuring the Middle Devonian 393ÿ383 Ma, the armoured jawless ostracoderm fishes were declining in diversity; the jawed fish were thriving and increasing in diversity in both the oceans and freshwater. The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop essential characteristics such as well developed lungs and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time. Cartilaginous fishes, class Chondrichthyes, consisting of sharks, rays and chimaeras, appeared by about 395 million years ago, in the middle Devonian\\r\\nDuring the Late Devonian the first forests were taking shape on land. The first tetrapods appear in the fossil record over a period, the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian 359 mya. The ancestors of all tetrapods began adapting to walking on land, their strong pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into legs (see Tiktaalik).[72] In the oceans, primitive sharks became more numerous than in the Silurian and the late Ordovician. The first ammonite mollusks appeared. Trilobites, the mollusk-like brachiopods and the great coral reefs, were still common.\\r\\nThe Late Devonian extinction occurred at the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the Famennian faunal stage, (the Frasnian-Famennian boundary), about 372.2 Ma. Many fossil agnathan fishes, save for the psammosteid heterostracans, make their last appearance shortly before this event. The Late Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems.\\r\\nA second extinction pulse, the Hangenberg event closed the Devonian period and had a dramatic impact on vertebrate faunas. Placoderms mostly became extinct during this event, as did most members of other groups including lobe-finned fishes, acanthodians and early tetrapods in both marine and terrestrial habitats, leaving only a handful of survivors. This event has been related to glaciation in the temperate and polar zones as well as euxinia and anoxia in the seas.\\r\\nBothriolepis (pitted scale) was the most successful genus of antiarch placoderms, if not the most successful genus of any placoderm, with over 100 species spread across Middle to Late Devonian strata across every continent.\\r\\nDunkleosteus is a genus of arthrodire placoderms that existed from 380 to 360 Ma. It grew up to 10 metres (33?ft) long[85][86] and weighed up to 3.6 tonnes.[87] It was a hypercarnivorous apex predator. Apart from its contemporary Titanichthys (below), no other placoderm rivalled it in size. Instead of teeth, Dunkleosteus had two pairs of sharp bony plates, which formed a beak-like structure. Apart from megalodon, it had the most powerful bite of any fish,[88] generating bite forces in the same league as Tyrannosaurus rex and the modern crocodile.[89]\\r\\nMaterpiscis (mother fish) is a genus of ptyctodontid placoderm from about 380 Ma. Known from only one specimen, it is unique in having an unborn embryo present inside, and with remarkable preservation of a mineralised placental feeding structure (umbilical cord). This makes Materpiscis the first known vertebrate to show viviparity, or giving birth to live young.[90] The specimen was named Materpiscis attenboroughi in honour of David Attenborough.[91]\\r\\nThe first tetrapods are four-legged, air-breathing, terrestrial animals from which the land vertebrates descended, including humans. They evolved from lobe-finned fish of the clade Sarcopterygii, appearing in coastal water in the middle Devonian, and giving rise to the first amphibians.[93]\\r\\nThe group of lobe-finned fishes that were the ancestors of the tetrapod are grouped together as the Rhipidistia,[94] and the first tetrapods evolved from these fish over the relatively short timespan 385ÿ360 Ma. The early tetrapod groups themselves are grouped as Labyrinthodontia. They retained aquatic, fry-like tadpoles, a system still seen in modern amphibians. From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land, possibly so they could go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper. However, in 1987, nearly complete fossils of Acanthostega from about 363 Ma showed that this Late Devonian transitional animal had legs and both lungs and gills, but could never have survived on land: its limbs and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight; its fish-like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground. The current hypothesis is that Acanthostega, which was about 1 metre (3.3?ft) long, was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water. Its skeleton differed from that of most fish, in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged, including: its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together, providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head; the head is not joined to the shoulder girdle and it has a distinct neck.[95]\\r\\nThe Devonian proliferation of land plants may help to explain why air-breathing would have been an advantage: leaves falling into streams and rivers would have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation; this would have attracted grazing invertebrates and small fish that preyed on them; they would have been attractive prey but the environment was unsuitable for the big marine predatory fish; air-breathing would have been necessary because these waters would have been short of oxygen, since warm water holds less dissolved oxygen than cooler marine water and since the decomposition of vegetation would have used some of the oxygen.[95]\\r\\nThere are three major hypotheses as to how tetrapods evolved their stubby fins (proto-limbs). The traditional explanation is the \\"shrinking waterhole hypothesis\\" or \\"desert hypothesis\\" posited by the American paleontologist Alfred Romer. He believed limbs and lungs may have evolved from the necessity of having to find new bodies of water as old waterholes dried up.[97]\\r\\nThe second hypothesis is the \\"inter-tidal hypothesis\\" put forward in 2010 by a team of Polish paleontologists led by Grzegorz Nied?wiedzki. They argued that sarcopterygians may have first emerged unto land from intertidal zones rather than inland bodies of water. Their hypothesis is based on the discovery of the 395 million-year-old Zache?mie tracks in Zache?mie, Poland, the oldest ever discovered fossil evidence of tetrapods.[93][98]\\r\\nThe third hypothesis, the \\"woodland hypothesis\\", was proposed by the American paleontologist Gregory J. Retallack in 2011. He argues that limbs may have developed in shallow bodies of water in woodlands as a means of navigating in environments filled with roots and vegetation. He based his conclusions on the evidence that transitional tetrapod fossils are consistently found in habitats that were formerly humid and wooded floodplains.[99]\\r\\nResearch by Jennifer A. Clack and her colleagues showed that the very earliest tetrapods, animals similar to Acanthostega, were wholly aquatic and quite unsuited to life on land. This is in contrast to the earlier view that fish had first invaded the land  either in search of prey (like modern mudskippers) or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out  and later evolved legs, lungs, etc.\\r\\nTwo ideas about the homology of arms, hands and digits have existed in the past 130 years. First that digits are unique to tetrapods[100][101] and second that antecedents were present in the fins of early sarcopterygian fish.[102] Until recently it was believed that \\"genetic and fossil data support the hypothesis that digits are evolutionary novelties\\".[103]p.?640. However new research that created a three-dimensional reconstruction of Panderichthys, a coastal fish from the Devonian period 385 million years ago, shows that these animals already had many of the homologous bones present in the forelimbs of limbed vertebrates.[104] For example, they had radial bones similar to rudimentary fingers but positioned in the arm-like base of their fins.[104] Thus there was in the evolution of tetrapods a shift such that the outermost part of the fins were lost and eventually replaced by early digits. This change is consistent with additional evidence from the study of actinopterygians, sharks and lungfish that the digits of tetrapods arose from pre-existing distal radials present in more primitive fish.[104][105] Controversy still exists since Tiktaalik, a vertebrate often considered the missing link between fishes and land-living animals, had stubby leg-like limbs that lacked the finger-like radial bones found in the Panderichthys. The researchers of the paper commented that it \\"is difficult to say whether this character distribution implies that Tiktaalik is autapomorphic, that Panderichthys and tetrapods are convergent, or that Panderichthys is closer to tetrapods than Tiktaalik. At any rate, it demonstrates that the fishÿtetrapod transition was accompanied by significant character incongruence in functionally important structures.\\".[104]p.?638.\\r\\nFrom the end of the Devonian to the Mid Carboniferous a 30 million year gap occurs in the fossil record. This gap, called Romer's gap, is marked by the absence of ancestral tetrapod fossils and fossils of other vertebrates that look well-adapted for life on land.[106]\\r\\nGenus of extinct lobe-finned fishes that has attained an iconic status from its close relationships to tetrapods. Early depictions of this animal show it emerging onto land, however paleontologists now widely agree that it was a strictly aquatic animal.[96] The genus Eusthenopteron is known from several species that lived during the Late Devonian period, about 385 Ma. It was the object of intense study from the 1940s to the 1990s by the paleoichthyologist Erik Jarvik.[107]\\r\\nUntil finds of other early tetrapods and closely related fishes in the late 20th century, Ichthyostega stood alone as the transitional fossil between fish and tetrapods, combining a fishlike tail and gills with an amphibian skull and limbs. It possessed lungs and limbs with seven digits that helped it navigate through shallow water in swamps.\\r\\nBy the late Devonian, land plants had stabilized freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats were not the only places to find water filled with organic matter and choked with plants with dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that this is the kind of environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines  they could not have lived in freshwater only.\\r\\nThe Carboniferous seas were inhabited by many fish, mainly Elasmobranchs (sharks and their relatives). These included some, like Psammodus, with crushing pavement-like teeth adapted for grinding the shells of brachiopods, crustaceans, and other marine organisms. Other sharks had piercing teeth, such as the Symmoriida; some, the petalodonts, had peculiar cycloid cutting teeth. Most of the sharks were marine, but the Xenacanthida invaded fresh waters of the coal swamps. Among the bony fish, the Palaeonisciformes found in coastal waters also appear to have migrated to rivers. Sarcopterygian fish were also prominent, and one group, the Rhizodonts, reached very large size.\\r\\nMost species of Carboniferous marine fish have been described largely from teeth, fin spines and dermal ossicles, with smaller freshwater fish preserved whole. Freshwater fish were abundant, and include the genera Ctenodus, Uronemus, Acanthodes, Cheirodus, and Gyracanthus.\\r\\nAs a result of the evolutionary radiation, carboniferous sharks assumed a wide variety of bizarre shapesincluding sharks of the family Stethacanthidae, which possessed a flat brush-like dorsal fin with a patch of denticles on its top.[116] Stethacanthus' unusual fin may have been used in mating rituals.[116] Apart from the fins, Stethacanthidae resembled Falcatus (below).\\r\\nPachycormiformes are an extinct order of ray-finned fish that existed from the Middle Triassic to the K-Pg extinction (below). They were characterized by serrated pectoral fins, reduced pelvic fins and a bony rostrum. Their relations with other fish are unclear.\\r\\nThe family Ichthyodectidae (literally \\"fish-biters\\") was a family of marine actinopterygian fish. They first appeared 156 Ma during the Late Jurassic and disappeared during the K-Pg extinction event 66 Ma. They were most diverse throughout the Cretaceous period. Sometimes classified in the primitive bony fish order Pachycormiformes, they are today generally regarded as members of the \\"bulldog fish\\" order Ichthyodectiformes in the far more advanced Osteoglossomorpha. Most ichthyodectids ranged between 1 and 5 meters (3.3 and 16.4?ft) in length. All known taxa were predators, feeding on smaller fish; in several cases, larger Ichthyodectidae preyed on smaller members of the family. Some species had remarkably large teeth, though others, such as Gillicus arcuatus, had small ones and sucked in their prey. The largest Xiphactinus was 20 feet long, and appeared in the Late Cretaceous (below).\\r\\nCretoxyrhina mantelli was a large shark that lived about 100 to 82 million years ago, during the mid Cretaceous period. It is commonly known as the Ginsu Shark. This shark was first identified by a famous Swiss Naturalist, Louis Agassiz in 1843, as Cretoxyhrina mantelli. However, the most complete specimen of this shark was discovered in 1890, by the fossil hunter Charles H. Sternberg, who published his findings in 1907. The specimen consisted of a nearly complete associated vertebral column and over 250 associated teeth. This kind of exceptional preservation of fossil sharks is rare because a shark's skeleton is made of cartilage, which is not prone to fossilization. Charles dubbed the specimen Oxyrhina mantelli. This specimen represented a 20-foot-long (6.1?m) shark.\\r\\nEnchodus is an extinct genus of bony fish. It flourished during the Upper Cretaceous and was small to medium in size. One of the genus' most notable attributes are the large \\"fangs\\" at the front of the upper and lower jaws and on the palatine bones, leading to its misleading nickname among fossil hunters and paleoichthyologists, \\"the saber-toothed herring\\". These fangs, along with a long sleek body and large eyes, suggest Enchodus was a predatory species.\\r\\nXiphactinus is an extinct genus of large predatory marine bony fish of the Late Cretaceous. They grew more than 4.5 metres (15 feet) long.[136]\\r\\nMegalodon is an extinct species of shark that lived about 28 to 1.5?Ma. It looked much like a stocky version of the great white shark, but was much larger with fossil lengths reaching 20.3 metres (67?ft).[147] Found in all oceans[148] it was one of the largest and most powerful predators in vertebrate history,[147] and probably had a profound impact on marine life.[149]\\r\\nPrehistoric fish are early fish that are known only from fossil records. They are the earliest known vertebrates, and include the first and extinct fish that lived through the Cambrian to the Tertiary. The study of prehistoric fish is called paleoichthyology. A few living forms, such as the coelacanth are also referred to as prehistoric fish, or even living fossils, due to their current rarity and similarity to extinct forms.

In Homo sapiens sapiens (modern humans) the eyebrows are located on their lower margin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supraorbital ridge is a nodule or crest of bone situated on the frontal bone of the skull. It forms the separation between the forehead portion itself (the squama frontalis) and the roof of the eye sockets (the pars orbitalis). Normally, in humans, the ridges arch over each eye, offering mechanical protection. In other primates, the ridge is usually continuous and often straight rather than arched. The ridges are separated from the frontal eminences by a shallow groove. The ridges are most prominent medially, and are joined to one another by a smooth elevation named the glabella.\\r\\nTypically, the arches are more prominent in men than in women, and vary between different ethnic groups. Behind the ridges, deeper in the bone, are the frontal sinuses.\\r\\nThe supraorbital ridges, being a prominent part of the face in some ethnic groups and a trait linked to both atavism and sexual dimorphism, have a number of names in different disciplines. In vernacular English, the terms eyebrow bone or eyebrow ridge are common. The more technical terms frontal or supraorbital arch, ridge or torus (or tori to refer to the plural, as the ridge is usually seen as a pair) are often found in anthropological or archaeological studies. In medicine, the term arcus superciliaris (Latin) or the English translation superciliary arch. This feature is different from the supraorbital margin and the margin of the orbit.\\r\\nSome paleoanthropologists distinguish between frontal torus and supraorbital ridge. In anatomy, a torus is a projecting shelf of bone that unlike a ridge is rectilinear, unbroken and goes through glabella.[1] Some fossil hominins, in this use of the word, have the frontal torus,[2] but modern humans can only have the ridge.[3]\\r\\nThe Spatial model proposes that supraorbital torus development can be best explained in terms of the disparity between the anterior position of the orbital component relative the neurocranium.\\r\\nMuch of the groundwork for the spatial model was laid down by Schultz (1940). He was the first to document that at later stages of development (after age 4) the growth of the orbit would outpace that of the eye. Consequently, he proposed that facial size is the most influential factor in orbital development, with orbital growth being only secondarily affected by size and ocular position.\\r\\nWeindenreich (1941) and Biegert (1957, 1963) argued that the supraorbital region can best be understood as a product of the orientation of its two components, the face and the neurocranium.\\r\\nThe most composed articulation of the spatial model was presented by Moss and Young (1960), who stated that \\"the presence of supraorbital ridges is only the reflection of the spatial relationship between two functionally unrelated cephalic components, the orbit and the brain\\" (Moss and Young, 1960, p282). They proposed (as first articulated by Biegert in 1957) that during infancy the neurocranium extensively overlaps the orbit, a condition that prohibits brow ridge development. As the splanchocranium grows, however, the orbits begin to advance, thus causing the anterior displacement of the face relative to the brain. Brow ridges then form as a result of this separation.\\r\\nThe bio-mechanical model predicts that morphological variation in torus size is the direct product of differential tension caused by mastication, as indicated by an increase in load/lever ratio and broad craniofacial angle.[4]\\r\\nResearch done on this model has largely been based on earlier work of Endo.[5][6][7][8] By applying pressure similar to the type associated with chewing, he carried out an analysis of the structural function of the supraorbital region on dry human and gorilla skulls. His findings indicated that the face acts as a pillar that carries and disperses tension caused by the forces produced during mastication. Russell[9][10] and Oyen et al.[11] elaborated on this idea, suggesting that amplified facial projection necessitates the application of enhanced force to the anterior dentition in order to generate the same bite power that individuals with a dorsal deflection of the facial skull exert. In more prognathic individuals, this increased pressure triggers bone deposition to reinforce the brow ridges, until equilibrium is reached.\\r\\nOyen et al. conducted[12] a cross-section study of Papio anubis in order to ascertain the relationship between palate length, incisor load and Masseter lever efficiency, relative to torus enlargement. Indications found of osteoblastic deposition in the glabella were used as evidence for supraorbital enlargement. Oyen et al.s data suggested that more prognathic individuals experienced a decrease in load/lever efficiency. This transmits tension via the frontal process of the maxilla to the supraorbital region, resulting in a contemporary reinforcement of this structure. This was also correlated to periods of tooth eruption.\\r\\nIn a later series of papers, Russell[9][13] developed aspects of this mode further. Employing an adult Australian sample, she tested the association between brow ridge formation and anterior dental loading, via the craniofacial angle (prosthion-nasion-metopion), maxilla breadth, and discontinuities in food preparation such as those observed between different age groups. Finding strong support for the first two criteria, she concluded that the supraorbital complex is formed as a result of increased tension due to the widening of the maxilla, thought to be positively correlated with the size of the masseter muscle, as well as with the improper orientation of bone in the superior orbital region.\\r\\nThe brow ridge functions to reinforce the weaker bones of the face in much the same way that the chin of modern humans reinforces their comparatively thin mandibles. This was necessary in pongids and early hominids because of the tremendous strain put on the cranium by their powerful chewing apparatuses, which is best demonstrated by any of the members of the genus Paranthropus. The brow ridge was one of the last traits to be lost in the path to anatomically modern humans, and only disappeared in a majority of modern humans with the development of the modern pronounced frontal lobe. This is one of the most salient differences between Homo sapiens and other species like the Homo neanderthalensis.\\r\\nThe size of these ridges varies also between different species of primates, either living or fossil. The closest living relatives of humans, the great apes, have a relatively pronounced supraorbital ridge, which has also been called a frontal torus[2] while in modern humans it is relatively reduced. The fossil record indicates that the supraorbital ridge in early hominins was reduced as the cranial vault grew; the frontal portion of the brain became positioned above rather than behind the eyes, giving a more vertical forehead.\\r\\nEarly modern people like the finds from Jebel Irhoud and Skhul and Qafzeh had thick, large brow ridges, and also some living people, have quite pronounced brow ridges, but they differ from those of archaic humans like Neanderthals by having a supraorbital foramen or notch, forming a groove through the ridge above each eye.[14] This splits the ridge into central parts and distal parts. In current humans, almost always only the central sections of the ridge are preserved (if preserved at all). This contrasts with many archaic and early modern modern humans, where the brow ridge is pronounced and unbroken (sometimes called frontal torus).[15]\\r\\nProminent supraorbital ridges among modern humans are most common among Australian Aborigines and Papuans.\\r\\nThis article incorporates text in the public domain from page 135 of?the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)","input":"What is the purpose of the brow ridge?"},{"output":"asteroid belt","context":"The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids.[1] About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea.[1] The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200?km).\\r\\nCeres, the asteroid belt's only dwarf planet, is about 950?km in diameter, whereas 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea have mean diameters of less than 600?km.[2][3][4][5] The remaining bodies range down to the size of a dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident.[6] Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within the asteroid belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).\\r\\nThe asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals.[7] Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet.[7][8] Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history.[9] Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.[10]\\r\\nClasses of small Solar System bodies in other regions are the near-Earth objects, the centaurs, the Kuiper belt objects, the scattered disc objects, the sednoids, and the Oort cloud objects.\\r\\nOn 22 January 2014, ESA scientists reported the detection, for the first definitive time, of water vapor on Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt.[11] The detection was made by using the far-infrared abilities of the Herschel Space Observatory.[12] The finding was unexpected because comets, not asteroids, are typically considered to \\"sprout jets and plumes\\". According to one of the scientists, \\"The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1596, Johannes Kepler predicted Between Mars and Jupiter, I place a planet in his Mysterium Cosmographicum.[13] While analyzing Tycho Brahe's data, Kepler thought that there was too large a gap between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.[14]\\r\\nIn an anonymous footnote to his 1766 translation of Charles Bonnet's Contemplation de la Nature,[15] the astronomer Johann Daniel Titius of Wittenberg[16][17] noted an apparent pattern in the layout of the planets. If one began a numerical sequence at 0, then included 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, etc., doubling each time, and added four to each number and divided by 10, this produced a remarkably close approximation to the radii of the orbits of the known planets as measured in astronomical units provided one allowed for a \\"missing planet\\" (equivalent to 24 in the sequence) between the orbits of Mars (12) and Jupiter (48). In his footnote, Titius declared \\"But should the Lord Architect have left that space empty? Not at all.\\"[16]\\r\\nWhen William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781, the planet's orbit matched the law almost perfectly, leading astronomers to conclude that there had to be a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.\\r\\nOn January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi, chair of astronomy at the University of Palermo, Sicily, found a tiny moving object in an orbit with exactly the radius predicted by this pattern. He dubbed it \\"Ceres\\", after the Roman goddess of the harvest and patron of Sicily. Piazzi initially believed it to be a comet, but its lack of a coma suggested it was a planet.[18]\\r\\nThus, the aforementioned pattern, now known as the TitiusÿBode law, predicted the semi-major axes of all eight planets of the time (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Ceres, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus).\\r\\nFifteen months later, Heinrich Olbers discovered a second object in the same region, Pallas. Unlike the other known planets, Ceres and Pallas remained points of light even under the highest telescope magnifications instead of resolving into discs. Apart from their rapid movement, they appeared indistinguishable from stars.\\r\\nAccordingly, in 1802, William Herschel suggested they be placed into a separate category, named \\"asteroids\\", after the Greek asteroeides, meaning \\"star-like\\".[19][20] Upon completing a series of observations of Ceres and Pallas, he concluded,[21]\\r\\nNeither the appellation of planets nor that of comets, can with any propriety of language be given to these two stars ... They resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them. From this, their asteroidal appearance, if I take my name, and call them Asteroids; reserving for myself, however, the liberty of changing that name, if another, more expressive of their nature, should occur.\\r\\nBy 1807, further investigation revealed two new objects in the region: Juno and Vesta.[22] The burning of Lilienthal in the Napoleonic wars, where the main body of work had been done,[23] brought this first period of discovery to a close.[22]\\r\\nDespite Herschel's coinage, for several decades it remained common practice to refer to these objects as planets[15] and to prefix their names with numbers representing their date of discovery: 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, 3 Juno, 4 Vesta. However, in 1845 astronomers detected a fifth object (5 Astraea) and, shortly thereafter, new objects were found at an accelerating rate. Counting them among the planets became increasingly cumbersome. Eventually, they were dropped from the planet list (as first suggested by Alexander von Humboldt in the early 1850s) and Herschel's choice of nomenclature, \\"asteroids\\", gradually came into common use.[15]\\r\\nThe discovery of Neptune in 1846 led to the discrediting of the TitiusÿBode law in the eyes of scientists because its orbit was nowhere near the predicted position. To date, there is no scientific explanation for the law, and astronomers' consensus regards it as a coincidence.[24]\\r\\nThe expression \\"asteroid belt\\" came into use in the very early 1850s, although it is hard to pinpoint who coined the term. The first English use seems to be in the 1850 translation (by E. C. Ott) of Alexander von Humboldt's Cosmos:[25] \\"[...] and the regular appearance, about the 13th of November and the 11th of August, of shooting stars, which probably form part of a belt of asteroids intersecting the Earth's orbit and moving with planetary velocity\\". Another early appearance occurred in Robert James Mann's A Guide to the Knowledge of the Heavens:[26] \\"The orbits of the asteroids are placed in a wide belt of space, extending between the extremes of [...]\\". The American astronomer Benjamin Peirce seems to have adopted that terminology and to have been one of its promoters.[27]\\r\\nOne hundred asteroids had been located by mid-1868, and in 1891 the introduction of astrophotography by Max Wolf accelerated the rate of discovery still further.[28] A total of 1,000 asteroids had been found by 1921,[29] 10,000 by 1981,[30] and 100,000 by 2000.[31] Modern asteroid survey systems now use automated means to locate new minor planets in ever-increasing quantities.\\r\\nIn 1802, shortly after discovering Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments of a much larger planet that once occupied the MarsÿJupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before.[32] Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. The large amount of energy required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Moon,[2] do not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet.[33] Today, most scientists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.\\r\\nIn general, in the Solar System, a planetary formation is thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets.[34] During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an accretion process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles, which gradually increased in size. Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become planetesimals. This gravitational accretion led to the formation of the planets.\\r\\nPlanetesimals within the region which would become the asteroid belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead, they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding.[35] In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion,[36] preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. Orbital resonances occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.[37]\\r\\nDuring the early history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, allowing elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5?billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation.[38] In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within ten million years of the Solar System's origin.[39]\\r\\nThe asteroids are not samples of the primordial Solar System. They have undergone considerable evolution since their formation, including internal heating (in the first few tens of millions of years), surface melting from impacts, space weathering from radiation, and bombardment by micrometeorites.[40] Although some scientists refer to the asteroids as residual planetesimals,[41] other scientists consider them distinct.[42]\\r\\nThe current asteroid belt is believed to contain only a small fraction of the mass of the primordial belt. Computer simulations suggest that the original asteroid belt may have contained the mass equivalent to the Earth.[43] Primarily because of gravitational perturbations, most of the material was ejected from the belt within about a million years of formation, leaving behind less than 0.1% of the original mass.[35] Since their formation, the size distribution of the asteroid belt has remained relatively stable: there has been no significant increase or decrease in the typical dimensions of the main-belt asteroids.[44]\\r\\nThe 4:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter, at a radius 2.06?AU, can be considered the inner boundary of the asteroid belt. Perturbations by Jupiter send bodies straying there into unstable orbits. Most bodies formed within the radius of this gap were swept up by Mars (which has an aphelion at 1.67?AU) or ejected by its gravitational perturbations in the early history of the Solar System.[45] The Hungaria asteroids lie closer to the Sun than the 4:1 resonance, but are protected from disruption by their high inclination.[46]\\r\\nWhen the asteroid belt was first formed, the temperatures at a distance of 2.7?AU from the Sun formed a \\"snow line\\" below the freezing point of water. Planetesimals formed beyond this radius were able to accumulate ice.[47][48] In 2006 it was announced that a population of comets had been discovered within the asteroid belt beyond the snow line, which may have provided a source of water for Earth's oceans. According to some models, there was insufficient outgassing of water during the Earth's formative period to form the oceans, requiring an external source such as a cometary bombardment.[49]\\r\\nContrary to popular imagery, the asteroid belt is mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over such a large volume that it would be improbable to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100?km,[50] and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that the asteroid belt has 0.7ÿ1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1?km or more.[51] The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11ÿ19, with the median at about 16.[52]\\r\\nThe total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated to be 2.8G1021 to 3.2G1021 kilograms, which is just 4% of the mass of the Moon.[3] The four largest objects, Ceres, 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea, account for half of the belt's total mass, with almost one-third accounted for by Ceres alone.[4][5]\\r\\nThe current belt consists primarily of three categories of asteroids: C-type or carbonaceous asteroids, S-type or silicate asteroids, and M-type or metallic asteroids.\\r\\nCarbonaceous asteroids, as their name suggests, are carbon-rich. They dominate the asteroid belt's outer regions.[53] Together they comprise over 75% of the visible asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids and have a very low albedo. Their surface composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements and volatiles removed.\\r\\nS-type (silicate-rich) asteroids are more common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun.[53][54] The spectra of their surfaces reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation. They have a relatively high albedo and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.\\r\\nM-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of the total population; their spectra resemble that of iron-nickel. Some are believed to have formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope does not appear to be primarily composed of metal.[55] Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7?AU.[56] It is not yet clear whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.[57]\\r\\nOne mystery of the asteroid belt is the relative rarity of V-type or basaltic asteroids.[59] Theories of asteroid formation predict that objects the size of Vesta or larger should form crusts and mantles, which would be composed mainly of basaltic rock, resulting in more than half of all asteroids being composed either of basalt or olivine. Observations, however, suggest that 99 percent of the predicted basaltic material is missing.[60] Until 2001, most basaltic bodies discovered in the asteroid belt were believed to originate from the asteroid Vesta (hence their name V-type). However, the discovery of the asteroid 1459 Magnya revealed a slightly different chemical composition from the other basaltic asteroids discovered until then, suggesting a different origin.[60] This hypothesis was reinforced by the further discovery in 2007 of two asteroids in the outer belt, 7472 Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16, with a differing basaltic composition that could not have originated from Vesta. These latter two are the only V-type asteroids discovered in the outer belt to date.[59]\\r\\nThe temperature of the asteroid belt varies with the distance from the Sun. For dust particles within the belt, typical temperatures range from 200?K (?73?C) at 2.2?AU down to 165?K (?108?C) at 3.2?AU[61] However, due to rotation, the surface temperature of an asteroid can vary considerably as the sides are alternately exposed to solar radiation and then to the stellar background.\\r\\nSeveral otherwise unremarkable bodies in the outer belt show cometary activity. Because their orbits cannot be explained through the capture of classical comets, it is thought that many of the outer asteroids may be icy, with the ice occasionally exposed to sublimation through small impacts. Main-belt comets may have been a major source of the Earth's oceans because the deuterium-hydrogen ratio is too low for classical comets to have been the principal source.[62]\\r\\nMost asteroids within the asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30. The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4.[52] Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near the plane of the ecliptic, some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane.\\r\\nSometimes, the term main belt is used to refer only to the more compact \\"core\\" region where the greatest concentration of bodies is found. This lies between the strong 4:1 and 2:1 Kirkwood gaps at 2.06 and 3.27 AU, and at orbital eccentricities less than roughly 0.33, along with orbital inclinations below about 20. As of 2006[update], this \\"core\\" region contained 93% of all discovered and numbered minor planets within the Solar System.[63] The JPL Small-Body Database lists 670000+ known main belt asteroids.[64]\\r\\nThe semi-major axis of an asteroid is used to describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun, and its value determines the minor planet's orbital period. In 1866, Daniel Kirkwood announced the discovery of gaps in the distances of these bodies' orbits from the Sun. They were located in positions where their period of revolution about the Sun was an integer fraction of Jupiter's orbital period. Kirkwood proposed that the gravitational perturbations of the planet led to the removal of asteroids from these orbits.[65]\\r\\nWhen the mean orbital period of an asteroid is an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, a mean-motion resonance with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new orbital elements. Asteroids that become located in the gap orbits (either primordially because of the migration of Jupiter's orbit,[66] or due to prior perturbations or collisions) are gradually nudged into different, random orbits with a larger or smaller semi-major axis.\\r\\nThe gaps are not seen in a simple snapshot of the locations of the asteroids at any one time because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions.[67]\\r\\nThe main gaps occur at the 3:1, 5:2, 7:3, and 2:1 mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. An asteroid in the 3:1 Kirkwood gap would orbit the Sun three times for each Jovian orbit, for instance. Weaker resonances occur at other semi-major axis values, with fewer asteroids found than nearby. (For example, an 8:3 resonance for asteroids with a semi-major axis of 2.71 AU.)[68]\\r\\nThe main or core population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, based on the most prominent Kirkwood gaps:\\r\\nThe asteroid belt may also be divided into the inner and outer belts, with the inner belt formed by asteroids orbiting nearer to Mars than the 3:1 Kirkwood gap (2.5?AU), and the outer belt formed by those asteroids closer to Jupiter's orbit. (Some authors subdivide the inner and outer belts at the 2:1 resonance gap (3.3 AU), whereas others suggest inner, middle, and outer belts; also see diagram).\\r\\nThe high population of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10?km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years.[70] A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading to the formation of a new asteroid family).[71] Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.\\r\\nAlong with the asteroid bodies, the asteroid belt also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the PoyntingÿRobertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.[72]\\r\\nThe combination of this fine asteroid dust, as well as ejected cometary material, produces the zodiacal light. This faint auroral glow can be viewed at night extending from the direction of the Sun along the plane of the ecliptic. Asteroid particles that produce the visible zodiacal light average about 40?m in radius. The typical lifetimes of main-belt zodiacal cloud particles are about 700,000?years. Thus, to maintain the bands of dust, new particles must be steadily produced within the asteroid belt.[72] It was once thought that collisions of asteroids form a major component of the zodiacal light. However, computer simulations by Nesvorny and colleagues attributed 85 percent of the zodiacal-light dust to fragmentations of Jupiter-family comets, rather than to comets and collisions between asteroids in the asteroid belt. At most 10 percent of the dust is attributed to the asteroid belt.[73]\\r\\nSome of the debris from collisions can form meteoroids that enter the Earth's atmosphere.[74] Of the 50,000 meteorites found on Earth to date, 99.8 percent are believed to have originated in the asteroid belt.[75]\\r\\nIn 1918, the Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama noticed that the orbits of some of the asteroids had similar parameters, forming families or groups.[76]\\r\\nApproximately one-third of the asteroids in the asteroid belt are members of an asteroid family. These share similar orbital elements, such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and orbital inclination as well as similar spectral features, all of which indicate a common origin in the breakup of a larger body. Graphical displays of these elements, for members of the asteroid belt, show concentrations indicating the presence of an asteroid family. There are about 20ÿ30 associations that are almost certainly asteroid families. Additional groupings have been found that are less certain. Asteroid families can be confirmed when the members display common spectral features.[77] Smaller associations of asteroids are called groups or clusters.\\r\\nSome of the most prominent families in the asteroid belt (in order of increasing semi-major axes) are the Flora, Eunoma, Koronis, Eos, and Themis families.[56] The Flora family, one of the largest with more than 800 known members, may have formed from a collision less than a billion years ago.[78] The largest asteroid to be a true member of a family (as opposed to an interloper in the case of Ceres with the Gefion family) is 4 Vesta. The Vesta family is believed to have formed as the result of a crater-forming impact on Vesta. Likewise, the HED meteorites may also have originated from Vesta as a result of this collision.[79]\\r\\nThree prominent bands of dust have been found within the asteroid belt. These have similar orbital inclinations as the Eos, Koronis, and Themis asteroid families, and so are possibly associated with those groupings.[80]\\r\\nThe main belt evolution after the Late Heavy Bombardment was very likely affected by the passages of large Centaurs and Trans-Neptunian Objecs (TNOs). Centaurs and TNOs that reach the inner Solar System can modify the orbits of main belt asteroids, though only if their mass is of the order of 10?9 m for single encounters or, one order less in case of multiple close encounters. However Centaurs and TNOs are unlikely to have significantly dispersed young asteroid families in the main belt, but they can have perturbed some old asteroid families. Current main belt asteroids that originated as Centaurs or Trans-Neptunian Objects may lie in the outer belt with short lifetimeP4?My, \\\\ most likely between 2.8?AU and 3.2?AU at larger eccentricities than typical of main belt asteroid.[81]\\r\\nSkirting the inner edge of the belt (ranging between 1.78 and 2.0 AU, with a mean semi-major axis of 1.9?AU) is the Hungaria family of minor planets. They are named after the main member, 434 Hungaria; the group contains at least 52 named asteroids. The Hungaria group is separated from the main body by the 4:1 Kirkwood gap and their orbits have a high inclination. Some members belong to the Mars-crossing category of asteroids, and gravitational perturbations by Mars are likely a factor in reducing the total population of this group.[82]\\r\\nAnother high-inclination group in the inner part of the asteroid belt is the Phocaea family. These are composed primarily of S-type asteroids, whereas the neighboring Hungaria family includes some E-types.[83] The Phocaea family orbit between 2.25 and 2.5 AU from the Sun.\\r\\nSkirting the outer edge of the asteroid belt is the Cybele group, orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5?AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The Hilda family orbit between 3.5 and 4.2?AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2?AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here the two families of Trojan asteroids can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1?km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the asteroid belt.[84]\\r\\nSome asteroid families have formed recently, in astronomical terms. The Karin Cluster apparently formed about 5.7 million years ago from a collision with a progenitor asteroid 33?km in radius.[85] The Veritas family formed about 8.3 million years ago; evidence includes interplanetary dust recovered from ocean sediment.[86]\\r\\nMore recently, the Datura cluster appears to have formed about 530 thousand years ago from a collision with a main-belt asteroid. The age estimate is based on the probability of the members having their current orbits, rather than from any physical evidence. However, this cluster may have been a source for some zodiacal dust material.[87][88] Other recent cluster formations, such as the Iannini cluster (circa 1ÿ5 million years ago), may have provided additional sources of this asteroid dust.[89]\\r\\nThe first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt was Pioneer 10, which entered the region on 16 July 1972. At the time there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft, but it has since been safely traversed by 12 spacecraft without incident. Pioneer 11, Voyagers 1 and 2 and Ulysses passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids. Galileo imaged 951 Gaspra in 1991 and 243 Ida in 1993, NEAR imaged 253 Mathilde in 1997, Cassini imaged 2685 Masursky in 2000, Stardust imaged 5535 Annefrank in 2002, New Horizons imaged 132524 APL in 2006, Rosetta imaged 2867 ?teins in September 2008 and 21 Lutetia in July 2010, and Dawn orbited Vesta between July 2011 and September 2012 and has orbited Ceres since March 2015.[90] On its way to Jupiter, Juno traversed the asteroid belt without collecting science data.[91] Due to the low density of materials within the belt, the odds of a probe running into an asteroid are now estimated at less than one in a billion.[92]\\r\\nMost belt asteroids imaged to date have come from brief flyby opportunities by probes headed for other targets. Only the Dawn, NEAR and Hayabusa missions have studied asteroids for a protracted period in orbit and at the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar System?L Local Interstellar Cloud?L Local Bubble?L Gould Belt?L Orion Arm?L Milky Way?L Milky Way subgroup?L Local Group?L Virgo Supercluster?L Laniakea Supercluster?L Observable universe?L Universe\\r\\nEach arrow (L) may be read as \\"within\\" or \\"part of\\".","input":"What is found mainly between mars and jupiter?"},{"output":"April 15, 1952","context":"The Legend of the Octopus is a sports tradition during Detroit Red Wings home playoff games involving dead octopuses thrown onto the ice rink. The origins of the activity go back to the 1952 playoffs, when a National Hockey League team played two best-of-seven series to capture the Stanley Cup. Having eight arms, the octopus symbolized the number of playoff wins necessary for the Red Wings to win the Stanley Cup. The practice started April 15, 1952, when Pete and Jerry Cusimano, brothers and storeowners in Detroit's Eastern Market, hurled an octopus into the rink of The Old Red Barn.[1] The team swept the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens en route to winning the championship, as well as winning two of the next three championships.\\r\\nSince 1952, the practice has persisted with each passing year. In one 1995 game, fans threw 36 octopuses, including a specimen weighing 38 pounds (17?kg).[2] The Red Wings' unofficial mascot is a purple octopus named Al, and during playoff runs, two of these mascots are also hung from the rafters of the Joe Louis Arena, symbolizing the 16 wins now needed to take home the Stanley Cup. The practice has become such an accepted part of the team's lore, fans have developed various techniques and \\"octopus etiquette\\" for launching the creatures onto the ice.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe octopus tradition has launched several other object-tossing moments.

Oilers fans continued throwing steaks, even at away games, resulting in several arrests at the away cities.[5]\\r\\nIn the 2002ÿ03 season, the Nashville Predators fans began throwing catfish onto their home ice, in response to the Red Wings tradition. The first recorded instance occurred on October 26, 2002 in a game between the Red Wings and the Predators.[6] Jessica Hanley, who helps clean the ice in the Gaylord Entertainment Center, told the press: \\"They are so gross. They're huge, they're heavy, they stink and they leave this slimy trail on the ice. But, hey, if it's good for the team, I guess we can deal with it.\\" This tradition continued in Game 3 of the 2008 Western Conference Quarterfinals matchup between the Detroit Red Wings and the Nashville Predators when Predator fans threw 4 catfish onto the ice.[7]\\r\\nDuring Game 4 of the 2007 Stanley Cup Western Conference Semifinals between the Detroit Red Wings and the San Jose Sharks, a Sharks fan threw a 3-foot leopard shark onto the ice at the HP Pavilion at San Jose after the Sharks scored their first goal with 2 minutes left in the first period.[8]\\r\\nDuring the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, in which the Red Wings defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins, seafood wholesalers in Pittsburgh, led by Wholey's Fish Market, began requiring identification from customers who purchased octopuses, refusing to sell to buyers from Michigan.[9] This also took place in the lead up to the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals with markets refusing to sell catfish to Tennessee Residents.\\r\\nIn Game 1 of the 2009ÿ10 Western Conference Quarterfinals between the Detroit Red Wings and the Phoenix Coyotes, a rubber snake was thrown onto the ice after a goal by the Coyotes' Keith Yandle.[10]\\r\\nIn Game 2 of the 2009ÿ10 Western Conference Semifinals between the Detroit Red Wings and San Jose Sharks, a small shark was tossed onto the ice with an octopus inside its mouth.[11]\\r\\nin Game 3 of the 2017 western conference finals between the Anaheim Ducks and the Nashville Predators a Predators fan threw a dead plucked duck on the ice.

After he retrieves an octopus, he has been known to twirl it above his head as he walks across the ice rink to the Zamboni entrance.[13] On April 19, 2008, NHL director of hockey operations Colin Campbell sent the Detroit Red Wings organization a memo that forbade Zamboni drivers from cleaning up any octopuses thrown onto the ice and imposed a $10,000 fine for violating the mandate.[14] The linesmen were instead instructed to perform any clean-up duties. In an email to the Detroit Free Press, NHL spokesman Frank Brown justified the ban because \\"matter flies off the octopus and gets on the ice\\" when Sobotka swings it above his head.[13] In an article describing the effects of the new rule, the Detroit Free Press dubbed the NHL's prohibition as \\"Octopus-gate\\".[15] By the beginning of the third round of the 2008 Playoffs, the NHL loosened the ban to allow for the octopus twirling to take place at the Zamboni entrance.[16]","input":"When did the detroit red wings octopus tradition begin?"},{"output":"ginger ale","context":"A Shirley Temple is a non-alcoholic mixed drink traditionally made with ginger ale and a splash of grenadine, garnished with a maraschino cherry.[1][2][3][4] Modern Shirley Temple recipes may substitute lemon-lime soda or lemonade and sometimes orange juice in part, or in whole.[5][6]\\r\\nShirley Temples are often served to children dining with adults in lieu of real cocktails, as is the similar Roy Rogers.\\r\\nThe cocktail may have been invented by a bartender at Chasen's, a restaurant in West Hollywood, California, to serve then-child actress Shirley Temple.

The British Hit Singles & Albums noted they were \\"tartan teen sensations from Edinburgh\\", and were \\"the first of many acts heralded as the 'biggest group since the Beatles' and one of the most screamed-at teeny-bopper acts of the 1970s\\".[1] For a relatively brief, but fervent period (nicknamed \\"Rollermania\\"), they were worldwide teen idols. The group's line-up had numerous changes over the years, but the classic line-up during its heyday included; guitarists Eric Faulkner and Stuart John Wood, singer Les McKeown, bassist Alan Longmuir, and drummer Derek Longmuir.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966 bassist Alan Longmuir, his younger brother, drummer Derek Longmuir and their schoolfriend, lead singer Gordon \\"Nobby\\" Clark, founded The Saxons in Edinburgh, Scotland. Soon after, they changed to The Bay City Rollers by throwing a dart at a map of the United States, which landed near Bay City, Michigan.[2] The Bay City Rollers' first manager was Tam Paton, himself a former big band leader.[3] Short-term members from this period included bassist David Paton (from 1969 to 1970) and keyboardist Billy Lyall (1969ÿ71), who went on to be founding members of another successful Edinburgh band, Pilot.\\r\\nAfter signing with Bell Records, the band's first hit was \\"Keep On Dancing\\" (UK No.?9, 1971), a cover of a 1965 hit by The Gentrys.[2][4] Clark was backed on vocals on \\"Keep On Dancing\\" by King, multi-tracked.[4] Upon this release's success, they made appearances on BBC One's Top of the Pops.\\r\\nSeveral non-charting singles were released over the following two years. This period saw the addition of long term member guitarist Eric Faulkner. In mid-1973 they narrowly missed the UK Singles Chart with the fourth single, \\"Saturday Night\\", one of many songs written and produced for the band by the songwriting duo of Scotsman Bill Martin and Irishman Phil Coulter.[citation needed] By the end of 1973, Clark had become disillusioned with the band's musical direction and decided to leave just when his recording of \\"Remember (Sha-La-La-La)\\" zoomed up the charts to No.6. He was replaced as lead singer by Les McKeown. A couple of months later, in early 1974, what became known as the classic line-up[2] was completed when guitarist John Devine was replaced by Stuart \\"Woody\\" Wood.\\r\\nIn late 1973 McKeown recorded lead vocals on \\"Remember (Sha-La-La-La)\\", and a lead-in to a series of UK chart hits. 16-year-old Stuart Wood completed the 'Classic Five' line up in February 1974 a week after the band had debuted the \\"Remember\\" single on Top Of The Pops (in which John Devine had mimed the piano part), and by the dawn of 1975 the band were well on their way to achieving global success likened to Beatles fame. The successful Classic Five line up consisted of Alan Longmuir, Derek Longmuir, Stuart Woody Wood, Eric Faulkner and Les McKeown.\\r\\nBeginning with \\"Remember\\" (UK No.?6), the Rollers' popularity exploded, and they released a string of hits on the UK chart. Following in succession were \\"Shang-a-Lang\\" (UK No.?2), \\"Summerlove Sensation\\" (UK No.?3), and \\"All of Me Loves All of You\\" (UK No.?4).[1]\\r\\nBy early 1975, they were one of the highest-selling acts in the UK. That year saw a successful UK tour, which prompted newspaper headlines about the rise of \\"Rollermania\\"[4] (this on the heels of \\"Osmondmania\\" a few years prior; both terms were take-offs on Beatlemania of a decade before). The Rollers were the subject of a 20-week UK television series, Shang-a-Lang.\\r\\nA cover of the Four Seasons' \\"Bye, Bye, Baby\\" stayed at No.?1 in the UK for six weeks in March and April 1975, selling nearly a million copies to become the biggest seller of the year, and the subsequent single \\"Give a Little Love\\" topped the charts in July 1975, their second No.?1 hit.[1][2] Two full-length LPs were produced during this period: Once Upon a Star (1975) and Wouldn't You Like It? (1975). Faulkner and Wood undertook the majority of the songwriting duties.\\r\\nBy this time, Bay City Roller fans had a completely distinctive style of dress, the main elements of which were calf-length tartan trousers and tartan scarves.[2]\\r\\nEnglish singer-songwriter Nick Lowe wrote a \\"jaundiced\\" (in Lowe's words[5]) paean to the band titled \\"Bay City Rollers We Love You\\". The track was \\"carefully sculpted\\" to be poor enough to get Lowe out of a recording contract with United Artists, but the strategy backfired. UA issued the record as by \\"The Tartan Horde\\",[6] which was the name given to Rollers fans in England, and it became a substantial hit in Japan.[5] Lowe was obliged to record a follow-up song called \\"Rollers Show\\", which did not meet with the same commercial success. This follow-up song was included on the US release of Lowe's first album, \\"Pure Pop for Now People\\".\\r\\nAs the group's popularity swelled to superstardom in the UK, a concerted effort was made by Arista Records (the record company that evolved from Bell) to launch the Rollers in North America. New Arista head Clive Davis was instrumental in grooming and overseeing the project. His work paid off, as in late 1975, the Rollers reached No.?1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Saturday Night\\", the song that had missed the UK chart completely two years earlier.[2] The Rollers gave the track their American debut via a satellite-link performance on Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell. In Canada, it fared equally well, hitting No.?1 on the RPM national singles chart on 10 January 1976.[7] The Bay City Rollers (1975) album (North American release only) hit No.?1 in the same chart on 7 February.[7]\\r\\nA second North American hit came with \\"Money Honey\\", written by Faulkner which hit No.?9 in the US. In Canada, it fared better, following its predecessor to the top, and giving them their second No.?1 in the RPM national singles chart on 13 March 1976.[8]\\r\\nThe North America/Japan release album Rock n' Roll Love Letter (1976) jumped from No.?25 to the top position in a single week in Canada, deposing their own Bay City Rollers (1975) album at No.?1 on the national chart on 27 March 1976,[9] but only managed to achieve the No.?31 spot on the US Billboard chart.\\r\\nThey were also extremely popular in Australia. One example of their popularity, was put into the book about Countdown ÿ the Australian TV music show which ran from 1974 - 1987. Their 1976 appearance on Countdown coincided with a total eclipse of the sun. Director Ted Emery recalls;\\r\\n'(there)... were thousands of kids done up in tartan pants that didn't reach the top of their shoes, constantly bashing on the plexiglas doors. They would do anything... to get into that television studio. There's 200 kids bashing on the door and a total eclipse of the sun occurred. I'd never seen one. On this day we all stopped in the studio and the Rollers went up on the roof. We stood out there and watched the flowers close up and all the automatic street lighting come on. It was chilling, the most fantastic thing you'd ever see. Downstairs the kids never turned around, staring into the plexiglas waiting to see the Rollers come out of the studio, go down the corridor and into the canteen. (They) never noticed the total eclipse of the sun'.[10]\\r\\nBy early 1976, the strain of success (and the discomfort of being a man in his late 20s in a teen band) had taken its toll on bassist Alan Longmuir, who decided to leave the group.[2] He was replaced for seven months by 17-year-old Ian Mitchell from Northern Ireland ÿ the first band member born outside Edinburgh, Scotland.[2] With Mitchell, the group released an album titled Dedication (1976), and hit the charts with a cover version of the Dusty Springfield song \\"I Only Want to Be with You\\", which reached US No.?12, as well as \\"Yesterday's Hero\\" (featuring live material from a 1976 personal appearance in Toronto's Nathan Phillips Square),[11] and \\"Dedication\\".\\r\\nAs the Rollers' popularity waned, the shuffling of personnel continued; Mitchell quit the band. He was replaced by guitarist Pat McGlynn, who joined the band with the forlorn wish that \\"I just hope I can cope.\\" McGlynn lasted only a few months before quitting in turn, complaining that the other Rollers had treated him like a servant.[citation needed] Further struggles involved the direction of their sound, as the members wished to pursue more sophisticated styles. They settled on David Bowie's producer, Harry Maslin, and in August 1977 released It's a Game as a four-piece group, comprising McKeown, Wood, Faulkner and Derek Longmuir. The It's a Game tour produced the live album Rollerworld: Live at the Budokan 1977, recorded in 1977 at Japan's Budokan Hall, but unreleased until 2001.\\r\\nOn the disc, they covered an unsuccessful 1973 single by String Driven Thing, \\"It's a Game\\" to give them their final UK Top 20 hit (#16 in May 1977). Oddly enough, this single provided them with their highest-charting German hit, reaching No.?4 in the same year.[12] The follow-up \\"You Made Me Believe in Magic\\" could only make No.?34 in July in the UK and No.?10 in the US, but this would be their final major success there too.[2]\\r\\nAt the end of 1978, the band had split with McKeown, then fired manager Tam Paton shortly after, and decided to continue in a more new-wave, rock-oriented sound. Their name was now The Rollers. South African-born Duncan Faure joined the band as new lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter. With Faure, the line-up produced three albums: Elevator (1979), Voxx (1980), and Ricochet (1981).[2] Following the expiry of the band's Arista contract, neither of the releases sold as well as expected, and they stopped touring by late 1981.\\r\\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, there were a few short tours. Seven past members played Japan in 1982, and again in 1983. A reunion album, Breakout, was released in Japan and Australia in 1985, and added drummer George Spencer. Breakout was written primarily by McKeown and McGlynn with minor contributions from Faulkner, Wood, and Mitchell.\\r\\nIn the late 1980s a version of the band called the 'New Rollers' was formed featuring Faulkner on lead vocals, Kass (Karen Prosser) on vocals, Jason Medvec on guitar, Andy Boakes on bass, Mark Roberts on drums. The band toured extensively throughout the US and Canada as well as tours of the UK and Australia. This group also released an independent 5-song EP titled \\"Party Hardy\\".\\r\\nIn 1990 Stuart Wood and Alan Longmuir joined with Faulkner to tour under the Bay City Rollers name, and issued several CDs of re-recordings of the old Roller tunes.\\r\\nThe classic line-up (minus Derek Longmuir)[13]) performed a one-off New Year's Eve millennium concert, the last official Bay City Rollers concert (1999ÿ2000) in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle in Scotland. Interest was rekindled in the UK by various television documentaries about the group, and a new television-advertised compilation of greatest hits, Very Best of the Bay City Rollers, which entered the UK Albums Chart on release in 2004 at No.?11.[1]\\r\\nOn 22 September 2015 The Bay City Rollers, including McKeown, Stuart Woody Wood and Alan Longmuir announced that were reforming and would play a show at the Glasgow Barrowlands on December 20.[14]\\r\\nAccording to the BBC, the Bay City Rollers sold 120?million records.[15]\\r\\nIn March 2007, six former members of the group (Faure plus the \\"classic line-up\\") announced a lawsuit against Arista Records in hopes of claiming what they describe as \\"tens of millions of dollars\\" of unpaid royalties. Nobby Clark has threatened to sue the other band members if their lawsuit is successful, stating that he was the creative force behind the band's success, despite the fact that he left the group in 1973 before the bulk of their fame and fortune began.[16][17]\\r\\nIn September 2010, Gordon \\"Nobby\\" Clark, Ian Mitchell and Pat McGlynn filed a complaint in the courts in United States against the six members (Faure plus the \\"classic line-up\\") over their being excluded from the case against Arista records. Clark, Mitchell and McGlynn were seeking to have their rights determined and are also seeking financial damages against the other Bay City Rollers for alleged breach of contract. In 2013 a judge in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the three due to the statute of frauds, which establishes that certain agreements must be in writing under certain conditions, with the appellate judge ruling, \\"A claim for unjust enrichment must be based on the value of plaintiffs' contribution to the joint effort of the band at the time it made the relevant records, not on the income stream resulting from a revival over thirty years later,\\"[18]\\r\\nIn March 2011 a New York judge determined that the Bay City Rollers can move forward with their four-year-old lawsuit against Arista Records, who themselves had denied responsibility for the majority of the royalties, claiming that the New York statute of limitations, which limits plaintiffs from recovering damages past six years in contract disputes, bars the Rollers' claims for royalties incurred prior to 2001. However, since the Rollers were able to show that Arista had continued to promise them their royalties in writing, the judge ruled that the statute was not applicable.[19]","input":"Who was the lead singer of the bay city rollers?"},{"output":"a few days before her death in October 1970","context":"\\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" is a song written by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster, originally performed by Roger Miller.

Early in his governorship, Wellesley adopted a policy of non-intervention in the princely states, but he later adopted the policy of forming subsidiary alliances, which played a major role in the expansion of British rule in India.\\r\\nIn a subsidiary alliance, princely rulers were not allowed to have an independent armed force. They were to be protected by the East India Company but had to pay for the subsidiary forces that the company was to maintain for protection. If Indian rulers failed to make the payment, part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example, the Nawab (ruler) of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the company in 1801, reason provided by British officer was Maladministration. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds.\\r\\nBy the late 18th century, the power of the Maratha Empire had weakened and the Indian Subcontinent was left with a great number of states, most small and weak. Many rulers accepted the offer of protection by Wellesley, as it gave them security against attack by their neighbours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian rulers under British protection surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to the British.

It was first recorded by Bruce Woolley and The Camera Club (with Thomas Dolby on keyboards) for their album English Garden, and later by British group the Buggles, consisting of Horn and Downes. The track was recorded and mixed in 1979, released as their debut single on 7 September 1979 by Island Records, and included on their first album The Age of Plastic. The backing track was recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, and mixing and vocal recording would later take place at Sarm East Studios.\\r\\nLike all the other tracks from the LP, \\"Video\\"'s theme was promotion of technology while worrying about its effects. This song relates to concerns about mixed attitudes towards 20th-century inventions and machines for the media arts. Musically, the song performs like an extended jingle and the composition plays in the key of D-flat major in common time at a tempo of 132 beats per minute. The track has been positively received, with reviewers praising its unusual musical pop elements. Although the song includes several common pop characteristics and six basic chords are used in its structure, Downes and writer Timothy Warner described the piece as musically complicated, due to its use of suspended and minor ninth chords for enhancement that gave the song a \\"slightly different feel.\\"\\r\\nCommercially, \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" was also a success. The track topped sixteen international music charts, including the official singles charts of the group's home country of the UK and other nations such as Australia, Austria, France, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as the Japanese Oricon International Chart. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa, the top 20 in Belgium and the Netherlands, and barely in the top 40 in the United States.\\r\\nThe song's music video was written, directed, and edited by Russell Mulcahy, and is well-remembered as the first music video shown on MTV in the United States at 12:01a.m. on 1 August 1981, and the first video shown on MTV Classic in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2010. The song has received several critical accolades, such as being ranked number 40 on VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the '80s.[1] It has been covered by many recording artists. Trevor Horn has done performances of the song, both at Buggles reunion performances and with The Producers, since 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Buggles, which formed in 1977, first consisted of Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes and Bruce Woolley.[2] They all wrote \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" in an hour of one afternoon in 1978, six months before it was recorded, together in Downes' apartment, which was located above a monumental stonemason's in Wimbledon Park London.[3][4][5] The piece was built up from a chorus riff developed by Woolley.[4] It is one of the three Buggles songs that he assisted in writing, the two others being \\"Clean, Clean\\" and \\"On TV.\\"[2] An early demo of the song they did helped the group get signed to Island Records to record and publish their debut album The Age of Plastic.[2][6] Woolley left during recording to form his own band, The Camera Club, which did their own version of \\"Video\\", as well as \\"Clean, Clean\\" for their album English Garden.[2]\\r\\nHorn has said that the short story \\"The Sound-Sweep\\", in which the title charactera mute boy vacuuming up stray music in a world without itcomes upon an opera singer hiding in a sewer, provided inspiration for \\"Video,\\" and he felt \\"an era was about to pass.\\"[7] Horn claimed that Kraftwerk was another influence of the song: \\"...It was like you could see the future when you heard Kraftwerk, something new is coming, something different. Different rhythm section, different mentality. So we had all of that, myself and Bruce, and we wrote this song probably six months before we recorded it.\\"[5]\\r\\nAll the tracks of The Age of Plastic deal with positives and concerns of the impact of modern technology.[6] The theme of \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" is thus nostalgia, with the lyrics referring to a period of technological change in the 1960s, the desire to remember the past and the disappointment that children of the current generation would not appreciate the past.[8] The lyrics relate to concerns of the varied behaviors towards 20th-century technical inventions and machines used and changed in media arts such as photography, cinema, radio, television, audio recording and record production.[9] Woolley worried about the song's name, given the existence of a band with the name Radio Stars and a song titled \\"Video King\\" by singer Snips.[10]\\r\\nMusically, \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" is a new wave and synthpop song.[11][12][13] It performs like an extended jingle,[11] sharing its rhythm characteristics with disco.[14] The piece plays in common time at a bright tempo of 132 beats per minute.[15] It is in the key of D? major,[4][15] and six basic chords are used in the song's chord progression.[14] According to Geoff Downes, \\"It's actually a lot more complicated piece of music than people think, for instance part of the bridge is actually chords suspended and minor 9ths. A lot of people transcribed the song wrongly, they thought it was a straight F# chord. The song was written in D flat. The suspended gives it a slightly different feel.\\"[4] Writing in his book, Pop Music: Technology and Creativity: Trevor Horn and the Digital Revolution, Timothy Warner said that the \\"relatively quiet introduction\\" helping the listener detect a high amount of \\"tape hiss\\" generated through the use of analogue multi-track tape recorders, as well as the timbre of the synthesized instruments, give an indication of the technical process and time of producing the song.[16]\\r\\nThe song was put in more than three months of production.[4] The instrumental track was recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London for twelve hours, with mixing and recording of vocals held at Sarm East Studios.[5][6][17] The entire song was mixed through a Trident TSM console.[6] \\"Video\\" was the first track recorded for the group's debut LP The Age of Plastic, which cost a sum of S60,000 (equivalent to S307,423 in 2014) to produce,[17] and the song had been mixed by Gary Langan four or five times.[6] According to Langan, \\"there was no total recall, so we just used to start again. Wed do a mix and three or four days later Trevor would go, 'It's not happening. We need to do this and we need to do that.' The sound of the bass drum was one of his main concerns, along with his vocal and the backing vocals. It was all about how dry and how loud they should be in the mix without the whole thing sounding ridiculous. As it turned out, that record still had the loudest bass drum ever for its time.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe song includes instrumentation of drums, bass guitar, electric guitar, synth strings, piano, glockenspiel, marimbas and other futuristic, twinkly sounds, and vocals.[4][11][18] Downes used a Solina, Minimoog and Prophet-5 to create the overdubbed orchestral parts.[4] Both the male and female voices differ to give a tonal and historical contrast.[19] When Langan was interviewed in December 2011, he believed the male vocal was recorded through either a dynamic Shure SM57, SM58, Sennheiser 421, or STC 4038 ribbon microphone, and that four of five takes had to be done.[6] The male voice echos the song's theme in the tone of the music, initially limited in bandwidth to give a \\"telephone\\" effect typical of early broadcasts, and uses a mid-Atlantic accent resembling that of British singers in the 1950s and '60s.[19] The Vox AC30 amplifier was used to achieve the telephone effect, and Gary Langan says he was trying to make it \\"loud without cutting your head off\\", in others words make the voice sound soft. Gary Langan and Trevor Horn also tried using a bullhorn, but they found it too harsh. Langan later compressed and EQ'd the male vocals, and he said that doing the compression for old-style vocal parts was a \\"real skill.\\"[6] The female vocals are panned in the left and right audio channels,[6] and sound more modern and have a New York accent.[19]\\r\\nThe single version of \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" lasts for 3 minutes and 25 seconds. The album version plays for 4 minutes and 13 seconds, about 48 seconds longer than the single version, as it fades into a piano and synth coda, which ends with a brief sampling of the female vocals.[6]\\r\\n\\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" was a huge commercial success, reaching number one on 16 different national charts.[20] In the Buggles' home country, the song made its debut on the UK Singles Chart in the top 40 at number 24, on the issue dated 29 September 1979.[21] The next week, the track entered into the chart's top ten at number six,[22] before topping the chart on the week of 20 October.[23] It was the 444th UK number-one hit in the chart's entire archive.[20] The single was later certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry for UK sales of 500,000.\\r\\nIn Australia, \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" reached number one, where it was the best-selling record for 27 years.[20] The track went number one on the Italian Singles Chart in 1980, where it became the best-selling single of the same year.[24] The song also made a number-one peak in France and Spain,[25][26] where it was certified gold and platinum, respectively, as well as Austria,[27] Ireland,[28] Sweden[29] and Switzerland.[30] In other parts of Europe and Oceania, \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" was a number-two hit in Germany and New Zealand,[31][32] and also charted in Flanders on the Ultratop 50[33] and in the Netherlands, on the Nationale Hitparade Top 50 (now the Single Top 100) and Dutch Top 40.[34][35]\\r\\n\\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" did not start charting in North America, however, until November 1979. In the United States, the song appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Cash Box Top 100, barely breaking into the top 40 on both charts.[36][37] In a 2015 list from Billboard, it tied with Marvin Gaye's recording of \\"The End of Our Road\\" as the \\"Biggest Hot 100 Hit\\" at the peak of number 40.[38] \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" had debuted at number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the week of 10 November 1979,[39] while on the Cashbox Top 100 it debuted at number 83 that same week.[40] It started also at number 83 on the Canadian RPM Top Single Chart.[41] By January 1980, it entered the top 40 at number 31,[42] and on 2 February made it into the top 20 at number 11.[43] Two weeks later, the song earned its peak in the top 10 at number 6 and issue dated 16 February 1980.[44]\\r\\nEver since its release, the Buggles' version of \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" has been given a mostly positive reception from music critics. Originally, the song became a Billboard Top Single Pick on 3 November 1979, whom the publication found the chorus catchy and also highlighted the orchestral instruments supporting the backing singers.[45] Although there had been a mixed review of the single from Smash Hits, who found the song to be \\"too tidy, like vymura\\" (wallpaper),[46] they listed it in a review of The Age of Plastic as one of the best tracks of the album, along with \\"Living in the Plastic Age\\".[47] Timothy Warner wrote that, although several common pop elements were still present in the song, it included stronger originality for its own purpose than most other pop hits released at the time.[48] These unusual pop music characteristics include the timbres of the male and female vocal parts, and the use of suspended fourth and ninths chords for enhancement in its progression.[14] He also felt it was unnecessary to dislike it as a \\"novelty song.\\"[48] AllMusic's Heather Phares said the track \\"can be looked on as a perfectly preserved new wave gem,\\" \\"just as the song looks back on the radio songs of the '50s and '60s.\\" She concluded her review by saying that it \\"still sounds as immediate as it did when it was released, however, and that may be the song's greatest irony.\\"[11]\\r\\nHowever, many writers called Woolley's recording of \\"Video\\" much better than the Buggles' version.[49][50][51] This included one critic who called both acts overall as of being very high quality, but felt that Woolley's version was more faithful to the source material than that of The Buggles, noting the filtered vocals and cute, female vocals of the latter rendition as giving it a novelty feel.[52] However, he also wrote of liking both versions of \\"Clean, Clean\\" on the same level.\\r\\nIn October 2016, OnePoll's Kevin Smith asked 2,000 listeners to vote for their favorite one-hit wonders for a poll; \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\" topped the list.[53]\\r\\nA rare live performance of the song by Horn and Downes came at a ZTT showcase in 1998.[54] In 2004, The Buggles re-united again with Bruce Woolley at Wembley Arena to perform \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" and \\"Living in the Plastic Age\\" as part of a tribute event to Horn to raise money for The Prince's Trust charity. They were joined by Debi Doss and Linda Jardim (now Linda Allan), who performed the background singing on the original recording. Paul Robinson, who played drums on the original, also appeared. Both Horn and Downes have performed the song live in other acts, including Yes (which Downes and Horn joined for the Drama album and tour in 1980), Downes in the 2006ÿ2009 revival of Asia with John Wetton singing lead and again in 2017 with Billy Sherwood singing lead, and Horn in his band The Producers, also in 2006.\\r\\nIn November 2006, The Producers played at their first gig in Camden Town. A video clip can be seen on ZTT Records of Horn singing lead vocals and playing bass in a performance of \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\". Tina Charles appears on a YouTube video singing 'Slave to the Rhythm' with The Producers[55] and Horn reveals that Tina was the singer and originator of the \\"Oh Ah-Oh Ah-Oh\\" part of 'Video'; fellow 5000 Volt member Martin Jay was also a session musician on The Buggles record.[56]\\r\\nRobbie Williams performed the song with Trevor Horn at the BBC Electric Proms on 20 October 2009.[57]\\r\\nSince 2010, Horn has performed \\"Video\\" with both the Buggles and his new band, Producers. Since 2011, he has added new vocals to his live performance before the song's final chorus:[58]\\r\\nVideo killed the radio star,\\r\\nHe hit him on the head with his old guitar,\\r\\nHe tried to run away, but didn't get far,\\r\\nThat's how video killed the radio star\\r\\nThe music video for \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\", written, directed and edited by Australian Russell Mulcahy,[59][60] was produced on a budget of $50,000.[3] It was filmed in only a day in South London,[59] and was edited in a couple of days.[60] Mulcahy asked Virginia Hey, a friend who was a model and aspiring actress, to dress \\"in a silver costume and be lowered via wires in a test tube.\\" There were about 30 takes required for shots of the actress in the tube. The tube falls over in the video, although Mulcahy claims it was not intended to be shown in the final edit.[59] Hans Zimmer can be briefly seen wearing black playing a keyboard,[61] and Debi Doss and Linda Jardim, who provided the female vocals for the song, are also seen.[62]\\r\\nThe video starts with a girl sitting in front of a radio. A black-and-white shot of Trevor Horn singing into a radio-era microphone is superimposed over the girl by the radio. The radio blows up by the time of the first chorus, and then in the second verse, she is seen transported into the future, where she meets Horn and a silver-jumpsuited female in a clear plastic tube. Shots of Horn and Geoff Downes are shown during the remainder of the video.[61]\\r\\nThe video was first released in 1979,[63] when it originally aired on the BBC's Top of the Pops for promotion of the single, rather than doing live performances.[3] Zimmer recalled in 2001 that the video drew criticism from some viewers who watched it before it aired on MTV, due to being \\"too violent because we blew up a television.\\"[3] The video is best known as marking the debut of MTV, when the US channel started broadcasting at 12:01 AM on 1 August 1981.[64] On 27 February 2000, it became the one-millionth video to be aired on MTV.[65] It also opened MTV Classic in the UK and Ireland, which replaced VH1 Classic on 1 March 2010, at 6 AM.[citation needed] The video marked the closing of MTV Philippines before its shutdown on 15 February 2010 at 11:49 PM.[66][67] MTV co-founder Bob Pittman said the video \\"made an aspirational statement. We didn't expect to be competitive with radio, but it was certainly a sea-change kind of video.\\"[3] In July 2013, multiple independent artists covered \\"Video\\" for the launch of the TV channel Pivot, which launched with the music video of the cover on 1 August at 6?am.[68]\\r\\nSources:[6][69]\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone","input":"When was video killed the radio star released?"},{"output":"Ripon","context":"Ripon is a city located in San Joaquin County, California.

Evra stated that he would shake Surez's hand before the game, having refused to in a previous game.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second minute, Barcelona's Javier Mascherano conceded a corner kick, which Juventus aimed at Evra but Barcelona cleared it. However two minutes later, Jordi Alba made a run on Barcelona's left, passing to Neymar and then Andrs Iniesta who set up Ivan Rakiti? to score the first goal from close range. Rakiti?'s goal was Barcelona's fastest goal in a Champions League Final,[57] and the fourth fastest in a Champions League Final overall.[58] In the 11th minute, Arturo Vidal of Juventus received the first yellow card for fouling Sergio Busquets. At half time, Barcelona led 1ÿ0.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nTen minutes into the second half, Juventus equalised: Claudio Marchisio back-heeled the ball to right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, who set up Carlos Tevez. Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andr ter Stegen blocked the shot from Tevez, but lvaro Morata levelled the scores by putting the rebound into the net. In the 67th minute, Juventus appealed for a penalty when Paul Pogba went down in the area when challenged by Dani Alves, but the referee did not give it. Two minutes later, Barcelona took the lead again when Lionel Messi shot from the edge of the area, Gianluigi Buffon blocked it and Surez put in the rebound. Soon after, Neymar put the ball into the net from Alba's cross, but it was disallowed as the referee deemed that Neymar had headed it into his own hand.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 78th minute, Barcelona substituted Iniesta, who gave his captain's armband to Xavi, making his 767th and final appearance for Barcelona.[60] Soon after, Juventus made three substitutions in quick succession: Vidal was replaced with Roberto Pereyra and Morata with Fernando Llorente, while Evra made way for Kingsley Coman. In added time, Barcelona made their final two changes, as Rakiti? made way for Jrmy Mathieu and the limping Surez for Pedro.[61]\\t\\r\\nIn the final added minute, Alves handled the ball near the halfway line, and Juventus launched the resulting free kick towards the Barcelona goal, where it was cleared. The ensuing counter-attack ended with Neymar scoring with the final kick to make it 3ÿ1.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nMan of the Match:\\r\\nAndrs Iniesta (Barcelona)[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAssistant referees:\\r\\nBahattin Duran (Turkey)[62]\\r\\nTar?k Ongun (Turkey)[62]\\r\\nFourth official:\\r\\nJonas Eriksson (Sweden)[62]\\r\\nAdditional assistant referees:\\r\\nHseyin G??ek (Turkey)[62]\\r\\nBar?? ?im?ek (Turkey)[62]\\r\\nReserve assistant referee:\\r\\nMustafa Emre Eyisoy (Turkey)[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nMatch rules[63]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the win, Barcelona became the first European club to achieve the treble twice.[65] Their fifth European title put them joint third with Bayern Munich and Liverpool. If only the Champions League era is considered, this is their fourth title, putting them joint first with Real Madrid,[66] until Madrid extend their lead by winning a fifth title in the Champions League era in the 2016 final.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, Juventus became the first team to lose six finals: they previously shared the record with Benfica and Bayern Munich.[66] Patrice Evra became the first player to play in four losing UEFA Champions League finals, having previously been a runner-up in 2004 (with Monaco), 2009 and 2011 (both with Manchester United).[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nNeymar's goal meant that three players shared the title of top scorer in the competition, alongside Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. He became the first player since Kak in 2006ÿ07 to be top scorer apart from those two. Messi was the top assister with six, with Ronaldo among the runners-up with four. After the final, both Messi and Ronaldo had a record 77 Champions League goals, but Ronaldo had one more if qualifiers were to be included.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking to Canal+ after his final game for Barcelona, Xavi said he felt nostalgic knowing that he would never play for the team again, but deemed it \\"incredible\\" to win the Champions League in his last appearance. He admitted that Barcelona had been shaken by Juventus' equaliser, but had recovered through Messi doing \\"his thing\\". Xavi praised manager Luis Enrique for his successes despite his disputes with the club's board; there was uncertainty whether Luis Enrique would remain in his position for the following season.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nLuis Enrique called the final \\"spectacular\\", and his team's opponents \\"absolutely top-level\\". Of the Juventus team, he singled out Buffon for praise. In his own side, he commented that Neymar had gone from \\"very, very good\\" in his previous season, to \\"spectacular\\" in this one, ranking him among the world's best players. Luis Enrique stated that Surez' performances had been worth the money Barcelona paid for him, despite initial doubt whether he would adapt to a new team. In spite of Barcelona's treble, the manager concluded that it had been \\"a difficult year, a transitional year\\".[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuventus manager Massimiliano Allegri praised his team for their efforts, and said that despite a few regrets, they could exit with confidence from their performance. He commented that the team reaching the final had inspired the city of Turin and the whole of Italy. Allegri added that to improve on the season would not mean winning a treble, but remaining within Europe's top 8 teams for the future.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter winning the final, Barcelona qualified for the 2015 UEFA Super Cup against compatriots Sevilla, winners of the 2014ÿ15 UEFA Europa League. In the match on 11 August in Tbilisi, Georgia, Barcelona won 5ÿ4 with Pedro scoring an extra-time winner. It was their fifth win in the competition, equalling Milan's record.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, Barcelona travelled to Japan as Europe's representative in the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup. They defeated China's Guangzhou Evergrande 3ÿ0 in the semi-finals and River Plate of Argentina by the same score in the final. It was a record third win in the competition, and their fifth trophy of the calendar year.[71]","input":"Which stadium is the champions league final 2015?"},{"output":"the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years","context":"Millennials (also known as Generation Y) are the generational demographic cohort following Generation X. There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years. Millennials are sometimes referred to as \\"echo boomers\\" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the baby boomers. The 20th-century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued, however, so the relative impact of the \\"baby boom echo\\" was generally less pronounced than the postÿWorld War II baby boom.\\r\\nAlthough Millennial characteristics vary by region, depending on social and economic conditions, the generation is generally marked by an increased use and familiarity with communications, media, and digital technologies.[1] In most parts of the world, their upbringing was marked by an increase in a liberal approach to politics and economics; the effects of this environment are disputed. The Great Recession has had a major impact on this generation because it has caused historically high levels of unemployment among young people, and has led to speculation about possible long-term economic and social damage to this generation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthors William Strauss and Neil Howe are widely credited with naming the millennials.[2] They coined the term in 1987, around the time children born in 1982 were entering preschool, and the media were first identifying their prospective link to the new millennium as the high school graduating class of 2000.[3] They wrote about the cohort in their books Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 (1991)[4] and Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation (2000).[3]\\r\\nIn August 1993, an Advertising Age editorial coined the phrase Generation Y to describe those who were aged 11 or younger as well as the teenagers of the upcoming ten years who were defined as different from Generation X.[5][6] According to journalist Bruce Horovitz, in 2012, Ad Age \\"threw in the towel by conceding that millennials is a better name than Gen Y\\",[2] and by 2014, a past director of data strategy at Ad Age said to NPR \\"the Generation Y label was a placeholder until we found out more about them\\".[7] Millennials are sometimes called Echo Boomers,[8] due to their being the offspring of the baby boomers and due to the significant increase in birth rates from the early 1980s to mid 1990s, mirroring that of their parents. In the United States, birth rates peaked in August 1990[9][10] and a 20th-century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued.[11][12] In his book The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom, author Elwood Carlson called this cohort the \\"New Boomers\\".[13]\\r\\nPsychologist Jean Twenge described millennials as \\"Generation Me\\" in her 2006 book Generation Me: Why Todays Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitledand More Miserable Than Ever Before, which was updated in 2014.[14][15] In 2013, Time magazine ran a cover story titled Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation.[16] Newsweek used the term Generation 9/11 to refer to young people who were between the ages of 10 and 20 years during the terrorist acts of 11 September 2001. The first reference to \\"Generation 9/11\\" was made in the cover story of the 12 November 2001 issue of Newsweek.[17] Alternative names for this group proposed include Generation We,[18] Global Generation, Generation Next[19] and the Net Generation.[20]\\r\\nChinese millennials are commonly called the 1980s and 1990s generations. At a 2015 conference in Shanghai organized by University of Southern California's US-China Institute, millennials in China were examined and contrasted with American millennials[21] Findings included millennials' marriage, childbearing, and child raising preferences, life and career ambitions, and attitudes towards volunteerism and activism.[22]\\r\\nA minority of demographers and researchers start the generation in the mid-to-late 1970s, such as Synchrony Financial which describes millennials as starting as early as 1976 and ending at 1992,[23][24] Mobilize.org which uses 1976ÿ1996,[25] MetLife which uses birth dates ranging 1977ÿ1994,[26] and Nielsen Media Research which uses 1977ÿ1995.[27][28]\\r\\nA majority of researchers and demographers start the generation in the early 1980s, with many ending the generation in the mid and late 1990s. Australia's McCrindle Research[29] regards 1980ÿ1994 as Generation Y birth years. A 2013 PricewaterhouseCoopers[30] report and Edelman Berland[31] use 1980ÿ1995. Gallup Inc.,[32][33][34] Eventbrite[35][36] and Dale Carnegie Training and MSW Research[37] all use 1980ÿ1996. Ernst and Young uses 1981ÿ1996.[38]\\r\\nAnother majority end the generation in the late 1990s or early 2000s. A 2017 viral video from BuzzFeed, detailing the seven living generations of Americans, described millennials as those born between 1981ÿ1997.[39] On the American television program Survivor, for their 33rd season, subtitled Millennials vs. Gen X, the \\"Millennial tribe\\" consisted of individuals born between 1984 and 1997.[40] Goldman Sachs,[41] Resolution Foundation,[42][43] and a 2013 Time magazine cover story[44] all use 1980ÿ2000. Millennialpolicycenter.org and SYZYGY, a digital service agency partially owned by WPP, uses 1981ÿ1998.[45][46][47] The United States Census Bureau uses 1982ÿ2000.[48] Pew Research Center defines millennials as being born from 1981 to about 1997, with no chronological end point firmly established.[49][50] CareerFAQ uses years between 1982-2000.[51]\\r\\nDemographers William Straus and Neil Howe define millennials as born between 1982ÿ2004.[2] However, Howe described the dividing line between millennials and the following Generation Z as \\"tentative\\", saying \\"you cant be sure where history will someday draw a cohort dividing line until a generation fully comes of age\\". He noted that the millennials' range beginning in 1982 would point to the next generation's window starting between 2000 and 2006.[52]\\r\\nIn his 2008 book The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom, author Elwood Carlson defined this cohort as born between 1983ÿ2001 based on the upswing in births after 1983 and finishing with the \\"political and social challenges\\" that occurred after the September 11 terrorist acts.[13] In 2016, U.S Pirg described millennials as those born between 1983 and 2000.[53][54][55]\\r\\nDue to birth-year overlap between definitions of Generation X and millennials, and the tentative nature of generations, some individuals born in the late 1970s and early 1980s see themselves as being \\"between\\" the two generations.[56][57][58][59] Names given to those born in the Generation X and Millennial cusp years include Xennials, The Lucky Ones, Generation Catalano, and the Oregon Trail Generation.[59][60][61][62][63] Individuals born between the years 1995-2000 are said to belong to the generation \\"YZ\\" cusp. [64]\\r\\nAuthors William Strauss and Neil Howe believe that each generation has common characteristics that give it a specific character with four basic generational archetypes, repeating in a cycle. According to their hypothesis, they predicted millennials will become more like the \\"civic-minded\\" G.I. Generation with a strong sense of community both local and global.[3] Strauss and Howe ascribe seven basic traits to the Millennial cohort: special, sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, and achieving. Arthur E. Levine, author of When Hope and Fear Collide: A Portrait of Today's College Student describes these generational images as \\"stereotypes\\".[65]\\r\\nStrauss and Howe's research has been influential, but it also has critics.[65] Psychologist Jean Twenge says Strauss and Howe's assertions are overly-deterministic, non-falsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence. Twenge, the author of the 2006 book Generation Me, considers millennials, along with younger members of Generation X, to be part of what she calls \\"Generation Me\\".[66] Twenge attributes millennials with the traits of confidence and tolerance, but also describes a sense of entitlement and narcissism, based on personality surveys showing increased narcissism among millennials compared to preceding generations when they were teens and in their twenties. She questions the predictions of Strauss and Howe that this generation will turn out civic-minded.[67][68] A 2016 study by SYZYGY a digital service agency, found millennials in the U.S. continue to exhibit elevated scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory as they age, finding millennials exhibited 16% more narcissism than older adults, with males scoring higher on average than females. The study examined two types of narcissism: grandiose narcissism, described as the narcissism of extraverts, characterized by attention-seeking behavior, power and dominance, and vulnerable narcissism, described as the narcissism of introverts, characterized by an acute sense of self-entitlement and defensiveness.[45][46][69]\\r\\nThe University of Michigan's \\"Monitoring the Future\\" study of high school seniors (conducted continually since 1975) and the American Freshman survey, conducted by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute of new college students since 1966, showed an increase in the proportion of students who consider wealth a very important attribute, from 45% for Baby Boomers (surveyed between 1967 and 1985) to 70% for Gen Xers, and 75% for millennials. The percentage who said it was important to keep abreast of political affairs fell, from 50% for Baby Boomers to 39% for Gen Xers, and 35% for millennials. The notion of \\"developing a meaningful philosophy of life\\" decreased the most across generations, from 73% for Boomers to 45% for millennials. The willingness to be involved in an environmental cleanup program dropped from 33% for Baby Boomers to 21% for millennials.[70] Millennials show a willingness to vote more than previous generations. With voter rates being just below 50% for the last four presidential cycles, they have already surpassed Gen Xers of the same age who were at just 36%.[71]\\r\\nA 2013 Pew Research Poll found that 84% of millennials, born since 1980, who were at that time between the ages of 18 and 32, favored legalizing the use of marijuana.[72] In 2015, the Pew Research Center also conducted research regarding generational identity that said a majority did not like the \\"Millennial\\" label.[73]\\r\\nIn March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how \\"millennials in adulthood\\" are \\"detached from institutions and networked with friends.\\"[74][75] The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about America's future, with 49% of millennials saying the countrys best years are ahead though they're the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment.\\r\\nFred Bonner, a Samuel DeWitt Proctor Chair in Education at Rutgers University and author of Diverse Millennial Students in College: Implications for Faculty and Student Affairs, believes that much of the commentary on the Millennial Generation may be partially accurate, but overly general and that many of the traits they describe apply primarily to \\"white, affluent teenagers who accomplish great things as they grow up in the suburbs, who confront anxiety when applying to super-selective colleges, and who multitask with ease as their helicopter parents hover reassuringly above them.\\" During class discussions, Bonner listened to black and Hispanic students describe how some or all of the so-called core traits did not apply to them. They often said that the \\"special\\" trait, in particular, is unrecognizable. Other socio-economic groups often do not display the same attributes commonly attributed to millennials. \\"It's not that many diverse parents don't want to treat their kids as special,\\" he says, \\"but they often don't have the social and cultural capital, the time and resources, to do that.\\"[65]\\r\\nIn his book Fast Future, author David Burstein describes millennials' approach to social change as \\"pragmatic idealism\\" with a deep desire to make the world a better place, combined with an understanding that doing so requires building new institutions while working inside and outside existing institutions.[76]\\r\\nElza Venter, an educational psychologist and lecturer at Unisa, South Africa, in the Department of Psychology of Education, believes members of Generation Y are digital natives because they have grown up experiencing digital technology and have known it all their lives. Prensky [77] coined the concept digital natives because this generation are native speakers of the digital language of computers, video games and the internet. This generation spans 20 years and its older members use a combination of face-to-face communication and computer mediated communication, while its younger members use mainly electronic and digital technologies for interpersonal communication.[78]\\r\\nThere are vast, and conflicting, amounts of literature and empirical studies discussing the existence of generational differences as it pertains to the workplace.[79] The majority of research concludes millennials differ from both their generational cohort predecessors, and can be characterized by a preference for a flat corporate culture, an emphasis on work-life balance and social consciousness.\\r\\nAccording to authors from Florida International University, original research performed by Howe and Strauss as well as Yu & Miller suggest Baby Boomers resonate primarily with loyalty, work ethic, steady career path, and compensation when it comes to their professional lives.[80] Generation X on the other hand, started shifting preferences towards an improved work-life balance with a heightened focus on individual advancement, stability, and job satisfaction.[80] Meanwhile, millennials place an emphasis on producing meaningful work, finding a creative outlet, and have a preference for immediate feedback.[80] In the article Challenges of the Work of the Future it is also stressed that millennials working at the knowledge-based jobs very often assume personal responsibility in order to make the most of what they do. As they are not satisfied with remaining for a long of time at the same job, their career paths become more dynamic and less predictable.[81] Findings also suggest the introduction of social media has augmented collaborative skills and created a preference for a team-oriented environment.[80]\\r\\nIn the 2010 the Journal of Business and Psychology, contributors Myers and Sadaghiani find millennials \\"expect close relationships and frequent feedback from supervisors\\" to be a main point of differentiation.[82] Multiple studies observe millennials associating job satisfaction with free flow of information, strong connectivity to supervisors, and more immediate feedback.[82] Hershatter and Epstein, researchers from Emory University, argue a lot of these traits can be linked to millennials entering the educational system on the cusp of academic reform, which created a much more structured educational system.[83] Some argue in the wake of these reforms, such as the No Child Left Behind Act, millennials have increasingly sought the aid of mentors and advisers, leading to 66% of millennials seeking a flat work environment.[83]\\r\\nHershatter and Epstein also stress a growing importance on work-life balance. Studies show nearly one-third of students' top priority is to \\"balance personal and professional life\\".[83] The Brain Drain Study shows nearly 9 out of 10 millennials place an importance on work-life balance, with additional surveys demonstrating the generation to favor familial over corporate values.[83] Studies also show a preference for work-life balance, which contrasts to the Baby Boomers' work-centric attitude.[82]\\r\\nData also suggests millennials are driving a shift towards the public service sector. In 2010, Myers and Sadaghiani published research in the Journal of Business and Psychology stating heightened participation in the Peace Corps and MeriCorps as a result of millennials, with volunteering being at all-time highs.[82] Volunteer activity between 2007 and 2008 show the Millennial age group experienced almost three-times the increase of the overall population, which is consistent with a survey of 130 college upperclassmen depicting an emphasis on altruism in their upbringing.[82] This has led, according to a Harvard University Institute of Politics, six out of ten millennials to consider a career in public service.[82]\\r\\nThe 2014 Brookings publication shows a generational adherence to corporate social responsibility, with the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHSS) 2013 survey and Universums 2011 survey, depicting a preference to work for companies engaged in the betterment of society.[84] Millennials' shift in attitudes has led to data depicting 64% of millennials would take a 60% pay cut to pursue a career path aligned with their passions, and financial institutions have fallen out of favor with banks comprising 40% of the generation's least liked brands.[84]\\r\\nIn 2008, author Ron Alsop called the millennials \\"Trophy Kids,\\"[85] a term that reflects a trend in competitive sports, as well as many other aspects of life, where mere participation is frequently enough for a reward. It has been reported that this is an issue in corporate environments.[85] Some employers are concerned that millennials have too great expectations from the workplace.[86] Some studies predict they will switch jobs frequently, holding many more jobs than Gen Xers due to their great expectations.[87] Psychologist Jean Twenge reports data suggests there are differences between older and younger millennials regarding workplace expectations, with younger millennials being \\"more practical\\" and \\"more attracted to industries with steady work and are more likely to say they are willing to work overtime which Twenge attributes to younger millennials coming of age following the financial crisis of 2007-2008.[88]\\r\\nThere is also a contention that the major differences are found solely between millennials and Generation X. Researchers from the University of Missouri and The University of Tennessee conducted a study based on measurement equivalence to determine if such a difference does in fact exist.[89] The study looked at 1,860 participants who had completed the Multidimensional Work Ethic Profile (MWEP), a survey aimed at measuring identification with work-ethic characteristics, across a 12-year period spanning from 1996 to 2008.[89] The results of the findings suggest the main difference in work ethic sentiments arose between the two most recent generational cohorts, Generation X and millennials, with relatively small variances between the two generations and their predecessor, the Baby Boomers.[89]\\r\\nThat said, some research fails to find convincing differences. A meta study conducted by researchers from The George Washington University and The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences questions the validity of workplace differences across any generational cohort. According to the researchers, disagreement in which events to include when assigning generational cohorts, as well as varied opinions on which age ranges to include in each generational category are the main drivers behind their skepticism.[90] The analysis of 20 research reports focusing on the three work-related factors of job satisfaction, organizational commitment and intent to turn over proved any variation was too small to discount the impact of employee tenure and aging of individuals.[90] Newer research shows that millennials change jobs for the same reasons as other generationsnamely, more money and a more innovative work environment. They look for versatility and flexibility in the workplace, and strive for a strong workÿlife balance in their jobs[91] and have similar career aspirations to other generations, valuing financial security and a diverse workplace just as much as their older colleagues.[92]\\r\\nSurveys of political attitudes among millennials in the United Kingdom have suggested increasingly social liberal views, as well as higher overall support for classical liberal economic policies than preceding generations. They are more likely to support same-sex marriage and the legalization of drugs.[93] The Economist parallels this with millennials in the United States, whose attitudes are more supportive of social liberal policies and same-sex marriage relative to other demographics.[93] They are also more likely to oppose animal testing for medical purposes than older generations.[94] Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist and democratic candidate in the 2016 United States presidential election, was the most popular candidate among Millennial voters in the primary phase, having garnered more votes from people under 30 in 21 states than the major parties' candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, did combined.[95] In April 2016, The Washington Post viewed him as changing the way millennials viewed politics, saying, \\"He's not moving a party to the left. He's moving a generation to the left.\\"[96][97] Bernie Sanders referred to millennials as \\"the least prejudiced generation in the history of the United States\\".[98] A 2014 poll for the libertarian Reason magazine suggested that American millennials were social liberals and fiscal centrists, more often than their global peers. The magazine predicted that millennials would become more conservative on fiscal issues once they started paying taxes.[99]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the majority of millennials opposed the British withdrawal from the European Union. Blaming Baby boomers, who largely supported the referendum, one commenter said: \\"The younger generation has lost the right to live and work in 27 other countries. We will never know the full extent of the lost opportunities, friendships, marriages and experiences we will be denied.\\"[100][101][102][103] The Washington Post phrased this as \\"we let you steal our future\\", reporting high voter turnout among those over 55 years of age and low voter turnout among those under 34 years of age.[104][105][106][107][108]\\r\\nIn some countries, like the U.S. and UK, millennials are more likely to support political correctness than their elders.[109] In 2015, a Pew Research study found 40% of millennials in the United States supported government restriction of public speech offensive to minority groups; agreeing with this were 27% of Gen Xers, 24% of Baby Boomers and only 12% of the Silent Generation. Pew Research noted similar age related trends in the United Kingdom, but not in Germany and Spain, where millennials were less supportive of restricting offensive speech than older groups, or France, Italy and Poland, where there were no noticeable age differences.[110] In the U.S. and UK, millennials have brought changes to higher education via drawing attention to microaggressions and advocating implementation of safe spaces and trigger warnings in the university setting. Critics of such changes have raised concerns regarding their impact on free speech, asserting these changes can promote censorship, while proponents have described these changes as promoting inclusiveness.[109][111][112]\\r\\nMillennial population size varies, depending on the definition used. William Strauss and Neil Howe projected in their 1991 book Generations that the U.S. Millennial population would be 76 million.[113] Later,[when?] using dates ranging from 1982 to 2004, Neil Howe revised the number to over 95 million people (in the U.S.).[citation needed] In a 2012 Time magazine article, it was estimated that there were approximately 80 million U.S. millennials.[114] The United States Census Bureau, using birth dates ranging from 1982 to 2000, stated the estimated number of U.S. millennials in 2015 was 83.1 million people.[115]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Pew Research Center found that millennials surpassed Baby Boomers to become the largest living generation in the United States. By analyzing 2015 U.S Census data they found there were 75.4 million millennials, based on Pew's definition of the generation which ranges from 1981 to 1997, compared to 74.9 million Baby Boomers.[116][117]\\r\\nEconomic prospects for some millennials have declined largely due to the Great Recession in the late 2000s.[118][119][120] Several governments have instituted major youth employment schemes out of fear of social unrest due to the dramatically increased rates of youth unemployment.[121] In Europe, youth unemployment levels were very high (56% in Spain,[122] 44% in Italy,[123] 35% in the Baltic states, 19.1% in Britain[124] and more than 20% in many more countries). In 2009, leading commentators began to worry about the long-term social and economic effects of the unemployment.[125] Unemployment levels in other areas of the world were also high, with the youth unemployment rate in the U.S. reaching a record 19.1% in July 2010 since the statistic started being gathered in 1948.[126] In Canada, unemployment among youths in July 2009 was 15.9%, the highest it had been in 11 years.[127] Underemployment is also a major factor. In the U.S. the economic difficulties have led to dramatic increases in youth poverty, unemployment, and the numbers of young people living with their parents.[128] In April 2012, it was reported that half of all new college graduates in the US were still either unemployed or underemployed.[129] It has been argued that this unemployment rate and poor economic situation has given millennials a rallying call with the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement.[130] However, according to Christine Kelly, Occupy is not a youth movement and has participants that vary from the very young to very old.[131]\\r\\nA variety of names have emerged in various European countries hard hit following the financial crisis of 2007ÿ2008 to designate young people with limited employment and career prospects.[132] These groups can be considered to be more or less synonymous with millennials, or at least major sub-groups in those countries. The Generation of ?700 is a term popularized by the Greek mass media and refers to educated Greek twixters of urban centers who generally fail to establish a career. In Greece, young adults are being \\"excluded from the labor market\\" and some \\"leave their country of origin to look for better options\\". They're being \\"marginalized and face uncertain working conditions\\" in jobs that are unrelated to their educational background, and receive the minimum allowable base salary of ?700 per month. This generation evolved in circumstances leading to the Greek debt crisis and some participated in the 2010ÿ2011 Greek protests.[133] In Spain, they're referred to as the mileurista (for ?1,000 per month),[134] in France \\"The Precarious Generation,[135]\\" and as in Spain, Italy also has the \\"milleurista\\"; generation of 1,000 euros (per month).[132]\\r\\nIn 2015, millennials in New York City were reported as earning 20% less than the generation before them, as a result of entering the workforce during the great recession. Despite higher college attendance rates than Generation X, many were stuck in low-paid jobs, with the percentage of degree-educated young adults working in low-wage industries rising from 23% to 33% between 2000 and 2014.[136] In 2016, research from the Resolution Foundation found millennials in the UK earned S8,000 less in their 20s than Generation X, describing millennials as \\"on course to become the first generation to earn less than the one before\\".[137][138]\\r\\nGeneration Flux is a neologism and psychographic (not demographic) designation coined by Fast Company for American employees who need to make several changes in career throughout their working lives due to the chaotic nature of the job market following the Great Recession. Societal change has been accelerated by the use of social media, smartphones, mobile computing, and other new technologies.[139] Those in \\"Generation Flux\\" have birth-years in the ranges of both Generation X and millennials. \\"Generation Sell\\" was used by author William Deresiewicz to describe millennials' interest in small businesses.[140]\\r\\nMillennials are expected to make up approximately half of the U.S. workforce by 2020. Millennials are the most highly educated and culturally diverse group of all generations, and have been regarded as hard to please when it comes to employers.[141] To address these new challenges, many large firms are currently studying the social and behavioral patterns of millennials and are trying to devise programs that decrease intergenerational estrangement, and increase relationships of reciprocal understanding between older employees and millennials. The UK's Institute of Leadership & Management researched the gap in understanding between Millennial recruits and their managers in collaboration with Ashridge Business School.[142] The findings included high expectations for advancement, salary and for a coaching relationship with their manager, and suggested that organizations will need to adapt to accommodate and make the best use of millennials. In an example of a company trying to do just this, Goldman Sachs conducted training programs that used actors to portray millennials who assertively sought more feedback, responsibility, and involvement in decision making. After the performance, employees discussed and debated the generational differences they saw played out.[85]\\r\\nMillennials have benefited the least from the economic recovery following the Great Recession, as average incomes for this generation have fallen at twice the general adult population's total drop and are likely to be on a path toward lower incomes for at least another decade. A Bloomberg L.P. article wrote that \\"Three and a half years after the worst recession since the Great Depression, the earnings and employment gap between those in the under-35 population and their parents and grandparents threatens to unravel the American dream of each generation doing better than the last. The nation's younger workers have benefited least from an economic recovery that has been the most uneven in recent history.\\"[143]\\r\\nIn 2014, millennials were entering an increasingly multi-generational workplace.[144] Even though research has shown that millennials are joining the workforce during a tough economic time they still have remained optimistic, as shown when about nine out of ten millennials surveyed by the Pew Research Center said that they currently have enough money or that they will eventually reach their long-term financial goals.[145]\\r\\nAmerican sociologist Kathleen Shaputis labeled millennials as the Boomerang Generation or Peter Pan generation, because of the members' perceived tendency for delaying some rites of passage into adulthood for longer periods than most generations before them. These labels were also a reference to a trend toward members living with their parents for longer periods than previous generations.[146] Kimberly Palmer regards the high cost of housing and higher education, and the relative affluence of older generations, as among the factors driving the trend.[147] Questions regarding a clear definition of what it means to be an adult also impacts a debate about delayed transitions into adulthood and the emergence of a new life stage, Emerging Adulthood. A 2012 study by professors at Brigham Young University found that college students were more likely to define \\"adult\\" based on certain personal abilities and characteristics rather than more traditional \\"rite of passage\\" events.[148] Larry Nelson noted that \\"In prior generations, you get married and you start a career and you do that immediately. What young people today are seeing is that approach has led to divorces, to people unhappy with their careers  The majority want to get married [] they just want to do it right the first time, the same thing with their careers.\\"[148] Their expectations have had a dampening effect on millennials' rate of marriage.\\r\\nA 2013 joint study by sociologists at the University of Virginia and Harvard University found that the decline and disappearance of stable full-time jobs with health insurance and pensions for people who lack a college degree has had profound effects on working-class Americans, who now are less likely to marry and have children within marriage than those with college degrees.[149] Data from a 2014 study of U.S. millennials revealed over 56% of this cohort considers themselves as part of the working class, with only approximately 35% considering themselves as part of the middle class; this class identity is the lowest polling of any generation.[150]\\r\\nResearch by the Urban Institute conducted in 2014, projected that if current trends continue, millennials will have a lower marriage rate compared to previous generations, predicting that by age 40, 30.7% of millennial women will remain single, approximately twice the share of their single Gen X counterparts. The data showed similar trends for males.[151][152] A 2016 study from Pew Research showed millennials delay some activities considered rites of passage of adulthood with data showing young adults aged 18ÿ34 were more likely to live with parents than with a relationship partner, an unprecedented occurrence since data collection began in 1880. Data also showed a significant increase in the percentage of young adults living with parents compared to the previous demographic cohort, Generation X, with 23% of young adults aged 18ÿ34 living with parents in 2000, rising to 32% in 2014. Additionally, in 2000, 43% of those aged 18ÿ34 were married or living with a partner, with this figure dropping to 31.6% in 2014. High student debt is described as one reason for continuing to live with parents, but may not be the dominant factor for this shift as the data shows the trend is stronger for those without a college education. Richard Fry, a senior economist for Pew Research said of millennials, they're the group much more likely to live with their parents. furthering they're concentrating more on school, careers and work and less focused on forming new families, spouses or partners and children.[153][154]\\r\\nAccording to a cross-generational study comparing millennials to Generation X conducted at Wharton School of Business, more than half of Millennial undergraduates surveyed do not plan to have children. The researchers compared surveys of the Wharton graduating class of 1992 and 2012. In 1992, 78% of women planned to eventually have children dropping to 42% in 2012. The results were similar for male students. The research revealed among both genders the proportion of undergraduates who reported they eventually planned to have children had dropped in half over the course of a generation.[155][156][157]\\r\\nIn the U.S., millennials are the least likely to be religious.[158] There is a trend towards irreligion that has been increasing since the 1940s.[159] 29 percent of Americans born between 1983 and 1994 are irreligious, as opposed to 21 percent born between 1963 and 1981, 15 percent born between 1948 and 1962 and only 7 percent born before 1948.[160] A 2005 study looked at 1,385 people aged 18 to 25 and found that more than half of those in the study said that they pray regularly before a meal. One-third said that they discussed religion with friends, attended religious services, and read religious material weekly. Twenty-three percent of those studied did not identify themselves as religious practitioners.[161] A Pew Research Center study on millennials shows that of those between 18ÿ29 years old, only 3% of these emerging adults self-identified as \\"atheists\\" and only 4% self-identified as \\"agnostics\\". Overall, 25% of millennials are \\"Nones\\" and 75% are religiously affiliated.[162]\\r\\nOver half of millennials polled in the United Kingdom in 2013 said they had \\"no religion nor attended a place of worship\\", other than for a wedding or a funeral. 25% said they \\"believe in a God\\", while 19% believed in a \\"spiritual greater power\\" and 38% said they did not believe in God nor any other \\"greater spiritual power\\". The poll also found 41% thought religion was \\"the cause of evil\\" in the world more often than good.[163] The British Social Attitudes Survey found that 71% of British 18-24 year-olds were not religious, with just 3% affiliated to the once-dominant Church of England.[164]\\r\\nIn their 2007 book, authors Junco and Mastrodicasa expanded on the work of William Strauss and Neil Howe to include research-based information about the personality profiles of millennials, especially as it relates to higher education. They conducted a large-sample (7,705) research study of college students. They found that Next Generation college students, born between 1983ÿ1992, were frequently in touch with their parents and they used technology at higher rates than people from other generations. In their survey, they found that 97% of these students owned a computer, 94% owned a mobile phone, and 56% owned an MP3 player. They also found that students spoke with their parents an average of 1.5 times a day about a wide range of topics. Other findings in the Junco and Mastrodicasa survey revealed 76% of students used instant messaging, 92% of those reported multitasking while instant messaging, 40% of them used television to get most of their news, and 34% of students surveyed used the Internet as their primary news source.[165][166] Older millennials came of age prior to widespread usage and availability of smartphones, defined as those born 1988 and earlier, in contrast to younger millennials, those born in 1989 and later, who were exposed to this technology in their teen years.[88]\\r\\nGen Xers and millennials were the first to grow up with computers in their homes. In a 1999 speech at the New York Institute of Technology, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates encouraged America's teachers to use technology to serve the needs of the first generation of kids to grow up with the Internet.[167] Some millennials enjoy having hundreds of channels from cable TV. However, some other millennials do not even have a TV, so they watch media over the Internet using smartphones and tablets.[168] One of the most popular forms of media use by millennials is social networking. In 2010, research was published in the Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research which claimed that students who used social media and decided to quit showed the same withdrawal symptoms of a drug addict who quit their stimulant.[169] Marc Prensky coined the term \\"digital native\\" to describe \\"K through college\\" students in 2001, explaining they \\"represent the first generations to grow up with this new technology.\\"[170] Millennials are identified as \\"digital natives\\" by the Pew Research Center which conducted a survey titled Millennials in Adulthood.[75]\\r\\nMillennials use social networking sites, such as Facebook, to create a different sense of belonging, make acquaintances, and to remain connected with friends.[171] In the Frontline episode \\"Generation Like\\" there is discussion about millennials, their dependence on technology, and the ways the social media sphere is commoditized.[172]\\r\\nStrauss & Howe's book titled Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation describes the Millennial generation as \\"civic-minded\\", rejecting the attitudes of the Baby Boomers and Generation X.[173] Since the 2000 U.S. Census, which allowed people to select more than one racial group, millennials in abundance have asserted the ideal that all their heritages should be respected, counted, and acknowledged.[174][175] Millennials are the children of Baby Boomers or Generation X, while some older members may have parents from the Silent Generation. A 2013 poll in the United Kingdom found that Generation Y was more \\"open-minded than their parents on controversial topics\\".[163][176] Of those surveyed, nearly 75% supported same-sex marriage.\\r\\nA 2013 Pew Research Poll found that 84% of millennials, born since 1980, who were at that time between the ages of 18 and 32, favored legalizing the use of marijuana.[72] In 2015, the Pew Research Center also conducted research regarding generational identity.[73] It was discovered that millennials are less likely to strongly identify with the generational term when compared to Generation X or to the Baby Boomers, with only 40% of those born between 1981 and 1997 identifying as part of the Millennial Generation. Among older millennials, those born 1981ÿ1988, Pew Research found 43% personally identified as members of the older demographic cohort, Generation X, while only 35% identified as millennials. Among younger millennials (born 1989ÿ1997), generational identity was not much stronger, with only 45% personally identifying as millennials. It was also found that millennials chose most often to define itself with more negative terms such as self-absorbed, wasteful or greedy. In this 2015 report, Pew defined millennials with birth years ranging from 1981 onwards.[73]\\r\\nMillennials came of age in a time where the entertainment industry began to be affected by the Internet.[177][178][179] In addition to millennials being the most ethnically and racially diverse compared to the generations older than they are, they are also on pace to be the most formally educated. As of 2008[update], 39.6% of millennials between the ages of 18 and 24 were enrolled in college, which was an American record. Along with being educated, millennials also tend to upbeat. As stated above in the economic prospects section, about 9 out of 10 millennials feel as though they have enough money or that they will reach their long-term financial goals, even during the tough economic times, and they are more optimistic about the future of the U.S. Additionally, millennials are also more open to change than older generations. According to the Pew Research Center that did a survey in 2008, millennials are the most likely of any generation to self-identify as liberals and are also more supportive of progressive domestic social agenda than older generations. Finally, millennials are less overtly religious than the older generations. About one in four millennials are unaffiliated with any religion, a considerably higher ratio than that of older generations when they were the ages of millennials.[145]","input":"When were you born to be a millenial?"},{"output":"1923 December 21","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NepalÿBritain Treaty of 1923 is considered to be one of the most important treaties in the History of Nepal. The treaty was first discussed in 1921 and the final treaty was signed in 1923 December 21 in Singha Durbar.[2] The treaty was the first formal acknowledgement by the British that Nepal as an independent nation had the right to conduct its foreign policy in anyway it seems fit and is considered to be A great achievement of 25 years of Chandra Shumsher's diplomacy.[3] The treaty was recorded in 1925 in the League of Nations.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the territory of Nepal has been united and fragmented multiple times during the reign of various rulers throughout history, the Expansion of Kingdom, campaign of present-day Nepal was initiated by Prithivi Narayan Shah, who succeeded to the throne of Gorkha after the death of his father Nara Bhupal Shah in 1743 (1799 BS). Nepal, at the time, was divided into more than 50 small principalities.[5] Prithivi Narayan Shah and his successors[6] expanded the territory of the small state of Gorkha into a large kingdom. At its peak, during the time of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, in 1810, the territory of Nepal extended from Sutlej River in the west to Tista River in the east.[7][8][9] However, the country of Nepal and its existence was still a mystery in many of the European countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sugauli Treaty of 1816 had rendered moot the degree of independence of Nepal. The sixth, seventh and eighth points of the treaty were:[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n6) The king of Nepal engages never to molest or disturb the king of Sikkim in the possession of his territories. If any difference shall arise between Nepal and Sikkim, it shall be referred to the arbitration of the East India Company. \\r\\n\\r\\n7) The king of Nepal hereby engages never to take or retain in his service any British subject, nor the subject of any European or American State, without the consent of the British Government. \\r\\n\\r\\n8) In order to secure and improve the relations of amity and peace hereby established between Nepal and Britain (East India Company), it is agreed that accredited Ministers from each shall reside at the court of the other.\\r\\nThe sixth point of the treaty directly questions the degree of independence of Nepal. The fact that any differences between Nepal and Sikkim will be \\"referred to the arbitration of the East India Company\\" sees Nepal as a semi-independent or a vassal state or tributary of the British empire. The seventh point also limits the Foreign policy of Nepal. The eighth point also is  due attention as the term \\"Resident Minister\\" is used, and not \\"ambassador\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814ÿ1816, Nepal had generally maintained a peaceful stance with the East-India company. The friendship between the two countries reached its pinnacle during the reign of Jang Bahadur Rana. During the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, Nepal also involved itself in favour of the East India Company.[11] After the Sepoy Mutiny, some areas of the Terai region that comprises today's Banke, Bardiya District, Kailali, and Kanchanpur districts of western terai collectively known as \\"Naya Muluk\\" (\\"New Country\\") were returned to Nepal.[12] Nepal also helped the British in the First World War. The relation between Nepal and Britain was generally good both before and after the treaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe then Prime Minister of Nepal, Chandra Shamsher wanted to conclude a treaty with Britain for the recognition of the independence of Nepal.[13] Aware of the implied restrictions placed upon the foreign policy of Nepal by the Sugauli Treaty, he wanted Nepal to be recognized as a fully sovereign nation. In 1921, when the Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, came to Kathmandu, Chandra Shumsher raised the question of formulating a new peace treaty between Nepal and Britain. The treaty was discussed by the British authorities in Kathmandu, Delhi and London for more than a year before the final treaty was signed, 21 December 1923, in Singha Durbar, Kathmandu.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe terms of the 1923 Nepal Britain Treaty were:[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Nepal and Britain will forever maintain peace and mutual friendship and respect each other's internal and external independence.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) All previous treaties, agreements and engagements, since and including the Sugauli Treaty of 1815, which have been concluded between the two Government are hereby essentially cancelled, except so far as they may be altered by the present Treaty.\\r\\n\\r\\n3) As the preservation of peace and friendly relations with the neighbouring States whose territories adjoin their common frontiers is to the mutual interests of both the High Contracting Parties, they hereby agree to inform each other of any rupture such friendly relations, and each to exert its good offices as far as may be possible to remove such friction and misunderstanding.\\r\\n\\r\\n4) Each of the High Contracting Parties will use all such measure as it may deem practicable to prevent its territories being used for purpose inimical to the security of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n5) In view of the longstanding friendship that has subsisted between the British Government and the Government of Nepal and for the sake of cordial neighbourly relations between them, the British Government agrees that the Nepal Government shall be free to import from or through British India into Nepal whatever arms, ammunition, machinery, warlike material or stores may be required or desired for the strength and welfare of Nepal, and that this arrangement shall hold good for all times as long as the British Government is satisfied that the intentions of the Nepal Government are friendly and that there is no immediate danger to India from such importations.

The treaty declared Nepal as an independent and sovereign nation, The treaty was also the first treaty between Nepal and Britain which was concluded with the mutual discussion between both nations. According to Nepalese historians, the main achievement of the treaty was the protection of the independence of Nepal and the increament of the status of Nepal among the other nations of the world. Most Nepalese historians agree that the treaty was the major achievement of the Rana rule.[16][17] The British representative residing in Nepal, previously known as Resident was from then titled as Envoy.[18]","input":"When did nepal established diplomatic relation with britain?"},{"output":"about 100","context":"see article\\r\\nThe recluse spiders or brown spiders, genus Loxosceles (/?l?k?s?s?liz/[citation needed]), also known as fiddle-backs, violin spiders, or reapers, are a genus of venomous spiders known for their bite, which sometimes produces a characteristic set of symptoms known as loxoscelism. Recluse spiders are now identified as members of the family Sicariidae, having formerly been placed in their own family, the Loxoscelidae. Although recluse spiders have a bad reputation, they are usually not aggressive.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSicariidae are of the superfamily Scytodoidea. Other families in the Scytodoidea include Drymusidae, Scytodidae, and Periegopidae.\\r\\nLoxosceles is distributed nearly worldwide in warmer areas. All have six eyes arranged in three groups of two (dyads) and some are brownish with a darker brown characteristic violin marking on the cephalothorax. However, the \\"violin marking\\" cannot be used as a reliable way to identify the spider as thousands of species of spider have similar markings. Spiders come with many markings varying greatly within the same species. Most Loxosceles can live for one and a half to two years. Many species of this genus can live for very long times without food or water. They are about 7ÿ12?mm long.\\r\\nThe most common and most famous species in the United States is the brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa). It is found in a large area of the Midwest, west to Colorado and the New Mexico state line and east to northern Georgia. Sporadic records from other locations only represent incidental introductions, not established populations.[citation needed] The brown recluse feeds on whatever small prey is available, and has been observed to prefer scavenging over actively hunting.[2] Other notable members of this genus include the Chilean recluse spider (L. laeta) and the Mediterranean recluse spider (L. rufescens).\\r\\nRecently, concerns have been raised regarding recluses spreading faster due to warmer air carrying them farther as a result of changing climate. On the contrary, newly hatched recluses do not travel via ballooning and thus the populations are confined to very tight spaces with dense populations.[3]\\r\\nLoxosceles spiders, like Sicarius species, have potent tissue-destroying venoms containing the dermonecrotic agent, sphingomyelinase D, which is otherwise found only in a few pathogenic bacteria.[4] Recent research has indicated the venom is composed largely of sulfated nucleosides, though these compounds are relatively new discoveries, so little is known about them.[5] The venom produces necrotic lesions that are slow to heal and may require skin grafts. Rarely, the venom is carried by the bloodstream, causing red blood cell destruction.\\r\\nThe venom is identical in male and female spiders, but females can have almost twice the concentration of toxins.[6] For unknown reasons, the toxicity of the venom to mammalian species varies; recluse bites may cause necrosis in humans, rabbits, and guinea pigs, but not in mice or rats.[6]\\r\\nThe Chilean recluse (L. laeta) supposedly has a more potent venom, which results in systemic involvement more often. This spider was introduced to the Los Angeles area (Alhambra, Sierra Madre, and Monterey Park). No verified bites and the subsequent systemic hemolysis have been documented, even though it has been known there for over 30 years. All Loxosceles species that have been tested have venoms similar to that of the brown recluse and all should be avoided. In general, though, they are not aggressive and commonly occupy human dwellings without causing problems.[7]\\r\\nMany types of skin wounds are mistaken for or assumed to be the result of a recluse spider bite.[8] Several diseases can mimic the lesions of the bite, including Lyme disease, various fungal and bacterial infections, and the first sore of syphilis.[9] It is important to associate the spider directly with the bite to avoid improper treatment, and to successfully treat common infections or other conditions if no spider was seen.\\r\\nBites most often occur as a defense when the spider is trapped against the skin, in clothing, for example.[3] Insecticides often fail to kill the spider, instead intoxicating its nervous system and inducing erratic behavior.[10]\\r\\nThe bite of a recluse spider can generally be categorized into one of the following groups:[3]\\r\\nMost bites are unremarkable or mild.[13][14][15]\\r\\nThere are about 100 species of Loxosceles.[3]\\r\\nSpecies include:","input":"How many species of recluse spiders are there?"},{"output":"modern-day southern Iraq","context":"Sumer (/?su?m?r/)[note 1] is the earliest known civilization in the historical region of southern Mesopotamia, modern-day southern Iraq, during the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze ages, and arguably the first civilization in the world with Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley.[1] Living along the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, Sumerian farmers were able to grow an abundance of grain and other crops, the surplus of which enabled them to settle in one place. Proto-writing in the prehistory dates back to c. 3000 BC. The earliest texts come from the cities of Uruk and Jemdet Nasr and date back to 3300 BC; early cuneiform script writing emerged in 3000 BC.[2]\\r\\nModern historians have suggested that Sumer was first permanently settled between c. 5500 and 4000 BC by a West Asian people who spoke the Sumerian language (pointing to the names of cities, rivers, basic occupations, etc., as evidence), an agglutinative language isolate.[3][4][5][6] These conjectured, prehistoric people are now called \\"proto-Euphrateans\\" or \\"Ubaidians\\",[7] and are theorized to have evolved from the Samarra culture of northern Mesopotamia.[8][9][10][11] The Ubaidians (though never mentioned by the Sumerians themselves) are assumed by modern-day scholars to have been the first civilizing force in Sumer, draining the marshes for agriculture, developing trade, and establishing industries, including weaving, leatherwork, metalwork, masonry, and pottery.[7]\\r\\nSome scholars contest the idea of a Proto-Euphratean language or one substrate language; they think the Sumerian language may originally have been that of the hunting and fishing peoples who lived in the marshland and the Eastern Arabia littoral region and were part of the Arabian bifacial culture.[12] Reliable historical records begin much later; there are none in Sumer of any kind that have been dated before Enmebaragesi (c. 26th century BC). Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians lived along the coast of Eastern Arabia, today's Persian Gulf region, before it was flooded at the end of the Ice Age.[13]\\r\\nSumerian civilization took form in the Uruk period (4th millennium BC), continuing into the Jemdet Nasr and Early Dynastic periods. During the 3rd millennium BC, a close cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians, who spoke a language isolate, and Akkadian-speakers, which included widespread bilingualism.[14] The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.[14] This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a Sprachbund.[14] Sumer was conquered by the Semitic-speaking kings of the Akkadian Empire around 2270 BC (short chronology), but Sumerian continued as a sacred language.\\r\\nNative Sumerian rule re-emerged for about a century in the Third Dynasty of Ur at approximately 2100ÿ2000 BC, but the Akkadian language also remained in use. The Sumerian city of Eridu, on the coast of the Persian Gulf, is considered to have been the world's first city, where three separate cultures may have fused: that of peasant Ubaidian farmers, living in mud-brick huts and practicing irrigation; that of mobile nomadic Semitic pastoralists living in black tents and following herds of sheep and goats; and that of fisher folk, living in reed huts in the marshlands, who may have been the ancestors of the Sumerians.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term Sumerian is the common name given to the ancient non-Semitic-speaking inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Sumer, by the East Semitic-speaking Akkadians. The Sumerians referred to themselves as ? sa? gg ga (cuneiform: ?? ?? ?? ??), phonetically /u? sa? gi ga/, literally meaning \\"the black-headed people\\", and to their land as ki-en-gi(-r) (cuneiform: ??????) ('place' + 'lords' + 'noble'), meaning \\"place of the noble lords\\".[16] The Akkadian word Shumer may represent the geographical name in dialect, but the phonological development leading to the Akkadian term ?umer? is uncertain.[17] Hebrew Shinar, Egyptian Sngr, and Hittite ?anhar(a), all referring to southern Mesopotamia, could be western variants of Shumer.[17]\\r\\nIn the late 4th millennium BC, Sumer was divided into many independent city-states, which were divided by canals and boundary stones. Each was centered on a temple dedicated to the particular patron god or goddess of the city and ruled over by a priestly governor (ensi) or by a king (lugal) who was intimately tied to the city's religious rites.\\r\\nThe five \\"first\\" cities, said to have exercised pre-dynastic kingship \\"before the flood\\":\\r\\nOther principal cities:\\r\\n(1location uncertain)\\r\\n(2an outlying city in northern Mesopotamia)\\r\\nMinor cities (from south to north):\\r\\n(2an outlying city in northern Mesopotamia)\\r\\nApart from Mari, which lies full 330 kilometres (205 miles) north-west of Agade, but which is credited in the king list as having exercised kingship in the Early Dynastic II period, and Nagar, an outpost, these cities are all in the Euphrates-Tigris alluvial plain, south of Baghdad in what are now the Bbil, Diyala, Wsit, Dhi Qar, Basra, Al-Muthann and Al-Qdisiyyah governorates of Iraq.\\r\\nThe Sumerian city-states rose to power during the prehistoric Ubaid and Uruk periods. Sumerian written history reaches back to the 27th century BC and before, but the historical record remains obscure until the Early Dynastic III period, c. the 23rd century BC, when a now deciphered syllabary writing system was developed, which has allowed archaeologists to read contemporary records and inscriptions. Classical Sumer ends with the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the 23rd century BC. Following the Gutian period, there was a brief Sumerian Renaissance in the 21st century BC, cut short in the 20th century BC by invasions by the Amorites. The Amorite \\"dynasty of Isin\\" persisted until c. 1700 BC, when Mesopotamia was united under Babylonian rule. The Sumerians were eventually absorbed into the Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) population.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Ubaid period is marked by a distinctive style of fine quality painted pottery which spread throughout Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. During this time, the first settlement in southern Mesopotamia was established at Eridu (Cuneiform: nun.ki ????), c. 6500 BC, by farmers who brought with them the Hadji Muhammed culture, which first pioneered irrigation agriculture. It appears that this culture was derived from the Samarran culture from northern Mesopotamia. It is not known whether or not these were the actual Sumerians who are identified with the later Uruk culture. The rise of the city of Uruk may be reflected in the story of the passing of the gifts of civilization (me) to Inanna, goddess of Uruk and of love and war, by Enki, god of wisdom and chief god of Eridu, may reflect the transition from Eridu to Uruk.[19]:174\\r\\nThe archaeological transition from the Ubaid period to the Uruk period is marked by a gradual shift from painted pottery domestically produced on a slow wheel to a great variety of unpainted pottery mass-produced by specialists on fast wheels. The Uruk period is a continuation and an outgrowth of Ubaid with pottery being the main visible change.[20][21]\\r\\nBy the time of the Uruk period (c. 4100ÿ2900 BC calibrated), the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of southern Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large, stratified, temple-centered cities (with populations of over 10,000 people) where centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labor captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide areafrom the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and as far east as central Iran.[22]\\r\\nThe Uruk period civilization, exported by Sumerian traders and colonists (like that found at Tell Brak), had an effect on all surrounding peoples, who gradually evolved their own comparable, competing economies and cultures. The cities of Sumer could not maintain remote, long-distance colonies by military force.[22]\\r\\nSumerian cities during the Uruk period were probably theocratic and were most likely headed by a priest-king (ensi), assisted by a council of elders, including both men and women.[23] It is quite possible that the later Sumerian pantheon was modeled upon this political structure. There was little evidence of organized warfare or professional soldiers during the Uruk period, and towns were generally unwalled. During this period Uruk became the most urbanized city in the world, surpassing for the first time 50,000 inhabitants.\\r\\nThe ancient Sumerian king list includes the early dynasties of several prominent cities from this period. The first set of names on the list is of kings said to have reigned before a major flood occurred. These early names may be fictional, and include some legendary and mythological figures, such as Alulim and Dumizid.[23]\\r\\nThe end of the Uruk period coincided with the Piora oscillation, a dry period from c. 3200 ÿ 2900 BC that marked the end of a long wetter, warmer climate period from about 9,000 to 5,000 years ago, called the Holocene climatic optimum.[24]\\r\\nThe dynastic period begins c. 2900 BC and was associated with a shift from the temple establishment headed by council of elders led by a priestly \\"En\\" (a male figure when it was a temple for a goddess, or a female figure when headed by a male god)[25] towards a more secular Lugal (Lu = man, Gal = great) and includes such legendary patriarchal figures as Enmerkar, Lugalbanda and Gilgameshwho are supposed to have reigned shortly before the historic record opens c. 2700 BC, when the now deciphered syllabic writing started to develop from the early pictograms. The center of Sumerian culture remained in southern Mesopotamia, even though rulers soon began expanding into neighboring areas, and neighboring Semitic groups adopted much of Sumerian culture for their own.\\r\\nThe earliest dynastic king on the Sumerian king list whose name is known from any other legendary source is Etana, 13th king of the first dynasty of Kish. The earliest king authenticated through archaeological evidence is Enmebaragesi of Kish (c. 26th century BC), whose name is also mentioned in the Gilgamesh epicleading to the suggestion that Gilgamesh himself might have been a historical king of Uruk. As the Epic of Gilgamesh shows, this period was associated with increased war. Cities became walled, and increased in size as undefended villages in southern Mesopotamia disappeared. (Both Enmerkar and Gilgamesh are credited with having built the walls of Uruk[26]).\\r\\nc. 2500ÿ2270 BC\\r\\nThe dynasty of Lagash, though omitted from the king list, is well attested through several important monuments and many archaeological finds.\\r\\nAlthough short-lived, one of the first empires known to history was that of Eannatum of Lagash, who annexed practically all of Sumer, including Kish, Uruk, Ur, and Larsa, and reduced to tribute the city-state of Umma, arch-rival of Lagash. In addition, his realm extended to parts of Elam and along the Persian Gulf. He seems to have used terror as a matter of policy.[27] Eannatum's Stele of the Vultures depicts vultures pecking at the severed heads and other body parts of his enemies. His empire collapsed shortly after his death.\\r\\nLater, Lugal-Zage-Si, the priest-king of Umma, overthrew the primacy of the Lagash dynasty in the area, then conquered Uruk, making it his capital, and claimed an empire extending from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. He was the last ethnically Sumerian king before Sargon of Akkad.[15]\\r\\nc. 2270ÿ2083 BC (short chronology)\\r\\nThe Eastern Semitic Akkadian language is first attested in proper names of the kings of Kish c. 2800 BC,[27] preserved in later king lists. There are texts written entirely in Old Akkadian dating from c. 2500 BC. Use of Old Akkadian was at its peak during the rule of Sargon the Great (c. 2270ÿ2215 BC), but even then most administrative tablets continued to be written in Sumerian, the language used by the scribes. Gelb and Westenholz differentiate three stages of Old Akkadian: that of the pre-Sargonic era, that of the Akkadian empire, and that of the \\"Neo-Sumerian Renaissance\\" that followed it. Akkadian and Sumerian coexisted as vernacular languages for about one thousand years, but by around 1800 BC, Sumerian was becoming more of a literary language familiar mainly only to scholars and scribes. Thorkild Jacobsen has argued that there is little break in historical continuity between the pre- and post-Sargon periods, and that too much emphasis has been placed on the perception of a \\"Semitic vs. Sumerian\\" conflict.[28] However, it is certain that Akkadian was also briefly imposed on neighboring parts of Elam that were previously conquered, by Sargon.\\r\\nc. 2083ÿ2050 BC (short chronology)\\r\\nc. 2093ÿ2046 BC (short chronology)\\r\\nFollowing the downfall of the Akkadian Empire at the hands of Gutians, another native Sumerian ruler, Gudea of Lagash, rose to local prominence and continued the practices of the Sargonid kings' claims to divinity. The previous Lagash dynasty, Gudea and his descendants also promoted artistic development and left a large number of archaeological artifacts.\\r\\nc. 2047ÿ1940 BC (short chronology)\\r\\nLater, the 3rd dynasty of Ur under Ur-Nammu and Shulgi, whose power extended as far as southern Assyria, was the last great \\"Sumerian renaissance\\", but already the region was becoming more Semitic than Sumerian, with the resurgence of the Akkadian speaking Semites in Assyria and elsewhere, and the influx of waves of Semitic Martu (Amorites) who were to found several competing local powers in the south, including Isin, Larsa, Eshnunna and some time later Babylonia. The last of these eventually came to briefly dominate the south of Mesopotamia as the Babylonian Empire, just as the Old Assyrian Empire had already done so in the north from the late 21st century BC. The Sumerian language continued as a sacerdotal language taught in schools in Babylonia and Assyria, much as Latin was used in the Medieval period, for as long as cuneiform was utilized.\\r\\nThis period is generally taken to coincide with a major shift in population from southern Mesopotamia toward the north. Ecologically, the agricultural productivity of the Sumerian lands was being compromised as a result of rising salinity. Soil salinity in this region had been long recognized as a major problem.[citation needed] Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of dissolved salts in the soil, eventually reducing agricultural yields severely. During the Akkadian and Ur III phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley, but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three fifths.[29] This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language. Henceforth, Sumerian would remain only a literary and liturgical language, similar to the position occupied by Latin in medieval Europe.\\r\\nFollowing an Elamite invasion and sack of Ur during the rule of Ibbi-Sin (c. 1940 BC)[citation needed], Sumer came under Amorites rule (taken to introduce the Middle Bronze Age). The independent Amorite states of the 20th to 18th centuries are summarized as the \\"Dynasty of Isin\\" in the Sumerian king list, ending with the rise of Babylonia under Hammurabi c. 1700 BC.\\r\\nLater rulers who dominated Assyria and Babylonia occasionally assumed the old Sargonic title \\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\", such as Tukulti-Ninurta I of Assyria after c. 1225 BC.\\r\\nUruk, one of Sumer's largest cities, has been estimated to have had a population of 50,000-80,000 at its height;[30] given the other cities in Sumer, and the large agricultural population, a rough estimate for Sumer's population might be 0.8 million to 1.5 million. The world population at this time has been estimated at about 27 million.[31]\\r\\nThe Sumerians spoke a language isolate, but a number of linguists have claimed to be able to detect a substrate language of unknown classification beneath Sumerian because names of some of Sumer's major cities are not Sumerian, revealing influences of earlier inhabitants.[32] However, the archaeological record shows clear uninterrupted cultural continuity from the time of the early Ubaid period (5300 ÿ 4700 BC C-14) settlements in southern Mesopotamia. The Sumerian people who settled here farmed the lands in this region that were made fertile by silt deposited by the Tigris and the Euphrates.\\r\\nSome archaeologists have speculated that the original speakers of ancient Sumerian may have been farmers, who moved down from the north of Mesopotamia after perfecting irrigation agriculture there. The Ubaid period pottery of southern Mesopotamia has been connected via Choga Mami transitional ware to the pottery of the Samarra period culture (c. 5700 ÿ 4900 BC C-14) in the north, who were the first to practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the middle Tigris River and its tributaries. The connection is most clearly seen at Tell Awayli (Oueilli, Oueili) near Larsa, excavated by the French in the 1980s, where eight levels yielded pre-Ubaid pottery resembling Samarran ware. According to this theory, farming peoples spread down into southern Mesopotamia because they had developed a temple-centered social organization for mobilizing labor and technology for water control, enabling them to survive and prosper in a difficult environment.[citation needed]\\r\\nOthers have suggested a continuity of Sumerians, from the indigenous hunter-fisherfolk traditions, associated with the bifacial assemblages found on the Arabian littoral. Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians may have been the people living in the Persian Gulf region before it flooded at the end of the last Ice Age.[33]\\r\\nIn the early Sumerian period, the primitive pictograms suggest[34] that\\r\\nThere is considerable evidence concerning Sumerian music. Lyres and flutes were played, among the best-known examples being the Lyres of Ur.[35]\\r\\nInscriptions describing the reforms of king Urukagina of Lagash (c. 2300 BC) say that he abolished the former custom of polyandry in his country, prescribing that a woman who took multiple husbands be stoned with rocks upon which her crime had been written.[36]\\r\\nSumerian culture was male-dominated and stratified. The Code of Ur-Nammu, the oldest such codification yet discovered, dating to the Ur III, reveals a glimpse at societal structure in late Sumerian law. Beneath the lu-gal (\\"great man\\" or king), all members of society belonged to one of two basic strata: The \\"lu\\" or free person, and the slave (male, arad; female geme). The son of a lu was called a dumu-nita until he married. A woman (munus) went from being a daughter (dumu-mi), to a wife (dam), then if she outlived her husband, a widow (numasu) and she could then remarry another man who was from the same tribe.\\r\\nMarriages were usually arranged by the parents of the bride and groom;[37]:78 engagements were usually completed through the approval of contracts recorded on clay tablets.[37]:78 These marriages became legal as soon as the groom delivered a bridal gift to his bride's father.[37]:78 One Sumerian proverb describes the ideal, happy marriage through the mouth of a husband who boasts that his wife has borne him eight sons and is still eager to have sex.[38]\\r\\nThe Sumerians generally seem to have discouraged premarital sex,[39] but it was probably very commonly done in secret.[37]:78 The Sumerians, as well as the later Akkadians, had no concept of virginity.[40]:91ÿ93 When describing a woman's sexual inexperience, instead of calling her a \\"virgin\\", Sumerian texts describe which sex acts she had not yet performed.[40]:92 The Sumerians had no knowledge of the existence of the hymen[40]:92 and whether or not a prospective bride had engaged in sexual intercourse was entirely determined by her own word.[40]:91ÿ92\\r\\nFrom the earliest records, the Sumerians had very relaxed attitudes toward sex[41] and their sexual mores were determined not by whether a sexual act was deemed immoral, but rather by whether or not it made a person ritually unclean.[41] The Sumerians widely believed that masturbation enhanced sexual potency, both for men and for women,[41] and they frequently engaged in it, both alone and with their partners.[41] The Sumerians did not regard anal sex as taboo either.[41] Entu priestesses were forbidden from producing offspring[42][38] and frequently engaged in anal sex as a method of birth control.[42][41][38]\\r\\nProstitution existed but it is not clear if sacred prostitution did.[43]:151\\r\\nThe most important archaeological discoveries in Sumer are a large number of clay tablets written in cuneiform script. Sumerian writing, while proven to not be the oldest example of writing on earth, is considered to be a great milestone in the development of humanity's ability to not only create historical records but also in creating pieces of literature, both in the form of poetic epics and stories as well as prayers and laws. Although pictures  that is, hieroglyphs  were used first, cuneiform and then ideograms (where symbols were made to represent ideas) soon followed. Triangular or wedge-shaped reeds were used to write on moist clay. A large body of hundreds of thousands of texts in the Sumerian language have survived, such as personal and business letters, receipts, lexical lists, laws, hymns, prayers, stories, and daily records. Full libraries of clay tablets have been found. Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects, like statues or bricks, are also very common. Many texts survive in multiple copies because they were repeatedly transcribed by scribes in training. Sumerian continued to be the language of religion and law in Mesopotamia long after Semitic speakers had become dominant.\\r\\nA prime example of cuneiform writing would be a lengthy poem that was discovered in the ruins of Uruk. The Epic of Gilgamesh was written in the standard Sumerian cuneiform. It tells of a king from the early Dynastic II period named Gilgamesh or \\"Bilgamesh\\" in Sumerian. The story is based around the fictional adventures of Gilgamesh and his companion, Enkidu. It was laid out on several clay tablets and is claimed to be the earliest example of a fictional, written piece of literature discovered so far.\\r\\nThe Sumerian language is generally regarded as a language isolate in linguistics because it belongs to no known language family; Akkadian, by contrast, belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic languages. There have been many failed attempts to connect Sumerian to other language families. It is an agglutinative language; in other words, morphemes (\\"units of meaning\\") are added together to create words, unlike analytic languages where morphemes are purely added together to create sentences. Some authors have proposed that there may be evidence of a substratum or adstratum language for geographic features and various crafts and agricultural activities, called variously Proto-Euphratean or Proto Tigrean, but this is disputed by others.\\r\\nUnderstanding Sumerian texts today can be problematic. Most difficult are the earliest texts, which in many cases do not give the full grammatical structure of the language and seem to have been used as an \\"aide-mmoire\\" for knowledgeable scribes.[44]\\r\\nDuring the 3rd millennium BC a cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism.[14] The influences between Sumerian on Akkadian are evident in all areas including lexical borrowing on a massive scaleand syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.[14] This mutual influence has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian of the 3rd millennium BC as a Sprachbund.[14]\\r\\nAkkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC,[45] but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary, and scientific language in Babylonia and Assyria until the 1st century AD.[46]\\r\\nThe Sumerians credited their divinities for all matters pertaining to them and exhibited humility in the face of cosmic forces, such as death and divine wrath.[37]:3ÿ4\\r\\nSumerian religion seems to have been founded upon two separate cosmogenic myths. The first saw creation as the result of a series of hieroi gamoi or sacred marriages, involving the reconciliation of opposites, postulated as a coming together of male and female divine beings; the gods. This continued to influence the whole Mesopotamian mythos. Thus, in the later Akkadian Enuma Elish, the creation was seen as the union of fresh and salt water; as male Abzu, and female Tiamat. The products of that union, Lahm and Lahmu, \\"the muddy ones\\", were titles given to the gate keepers of the E-Abzu temple of Enki, in Eridu, the first Sumerian city. Describing the way that muddy islands emerge from the confluence of fresh and salty water at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the river deposited its load of silt, a second hieros gamos supposedly created Anshar and Kishar, the \\"sky-pivot\\" or axle, and the \\"earth pivot\\", parents in turn of Anu (the sky) and Ki (the earth). Another important Sumerian hieros gamos was that between Ki, here known as Ninhursag or \\"Lady of the Mountains\\", and Enki of Eridu, the god of fresh water which brought forth greenery and pasture.\\r\\nAt an early stage, following the dawn of recorded history, Nippur, in central Mesopotamia, replaced Eridu in the south as the primary temple city, whose priests exercised political hegemony on the other city-states. Nippur retained this status throughout the Sumerian period.\\r\\nSumerians believed in an anthropomorphic polytheism, or the belief in many gods in human form. There was no common set of gods; each city-state had its own patrons, temples, and priest-kings. Nonetheless, these were not exclusive; the gods of one city were often acknowledged elsewhere. Sumerian speakers were among the earliest people to record their beliefs in writing, and were a major inspiration in later Mesopotamian mythology, religion, and astrology.\\r\\nThe Sumerians worshiped:\\r\\nThese deities formed a core pantheon; there were additionally hundreds of minor ones. Sumerian gods could thus have associations with different cities, and their religious importance often waxed and waned with those cities' political power. The gods were said to have created human beings from clay for the purpose of serving them. The temples organized the mass labour projects needed for irrigation agriculture. Citizens had a labor duty to the temple, though they could avoid it by a payment of silver.\\r\\nSumerians believed that the universe consisted of a flat disk enclosed by a dome. The Sumerian afterlife involved a descent into a gloomy netherworld to spend eternity in a wretched existence as a Gidim (ghost).[51]\\r\\nThe universe was divided into four quarters:\\r\\nTheir known world extended from The Upper Sea or Mediterranean coastline, to The Lower Sea, the Persian Gulf and the land of Meluhha (probably the Indus Valley) and Magan (Oman), famed for its copper ores.\\r\\nZiggurats (Sumerian temples) each had an individual name and consisted of a forecourt, with a central pond for purification.[52] The temple itself had a central nave with aisles along either side. Flanking the aisles would be rooms for the priests. At one end would stand the podium and a mudbrick table for animal and vegetable sacrifices. Granaries and storehouses were usually located near the temples. After a time the Sumerians began to place the temples on top of multi-layered square constructions built as a series of rising terraces, giving rise to the Ziggurat style.[53]\\r\\nIt was believed that when people died, they would be confined to a gloomy world of Ereshkigal, whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving. The dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse, along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food. Those who could afford it sought burial at Dilmun.[54] Human sacrifice was found in the death pits at the Ur royal cemetery where Queen Puabi was accompanied in death by her servants.\\r\\nThe Sumerians adopted an agricultural lifestyle perhaps as early as c. 5000 BC ÿ 4500 BC. The region demonstrated a number of core agricultural techniques, including organized irrigation, large-scale intensive cultivation of land, mono-cropping involving the use of plough agriculture, and the use of an agricultural specialized labour force under bureaucratic control. The necessity to manage temple accounts with this organization led to the development of writing (c. 3500 BC).\\r\\nIn the early Sumerian Uruk period, the primitive pictograms suggest that sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs were domesticated. They used oxen as their primary beasts of burden and donkeys or equids as their primary transport animal and \\"woollen clothing as well as rugs were made from the wool or hair of the animals. ... By the side of the house was an enclosed garden planted with trees and other plants; wheat and probably other cereals were sown in the fields, and the shaduf was already employed for the purpose of irrigation. Plants were also grown in pots or vases.\\"[34]\\r\\nThe Sumerians were one of the first known beer drinking societies. Cereals were plentiful and were the key ingredient in their early brew. They brewed multiple kinds of beer consisting of wheat, barley, and mixed grain beers. Beer brewing was very important to the Sumerians. It was referenced in the Epic of Gilgamesh when Enkidu was introduced to the food and beer of Gilgamesh's people: \\"Drink the beer, as is the custom of the land... He drank the beer-seven jugs! and became expansive and sang with joy!\\"[55]\\r\\nThe Sumerians practiced similar irrigation techniques as those used in Egypt.[56] American anthropologist Robert McCormick Adams says that irrigation development was associated with urbanization,[57] and that 89% of the population lived in the cities.\\r\\nThey grew barley, chickpeas, lentils, wheat, dates, onions, garlic, lettuce, leeks and mustard. Sumerians caught many fish and hunted fowl and gazelle.[58]\\r\\nSumerian agriculture depended heavily on irrigation. The irrigation was accomplished by the use of shaduf, canals, channels, dykes, weirs, and reservoirs. The frequent violent floods of the Tigris, and less so, of the Euphrates, meant that canals required frequent repair and continual removal of silt, and survey markers and boundary stones needed to be continually replaced. The government required individuals to work on the canals in a corvee, although the rich were able to exempt themselves.\\r\\nAs is known from the \\"Sumerian Farmer's Almanac\\", after the flood season and after the Spring Equinox and the Akitu or New Year Festival, using the canals, farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water. Next they made oxen stomp the ground and kill weeds. They then dragged the fields with pickaxes. After drying, they plowed, harrowed, and raked the ground three times, and pulverized it with a mattock, before planting seed. Unfortunately, the high evaporation rate resulted in a gradual increase in the salinity of the fields. By the Ur III period, farmers had switched from wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley as their principal crop.\\r\\nSumerians harvested during the spring in three-person teams consisting of a reaper, a binder, and a sheaf handler.[59] The farmers would use threshing wagons, driven by oxen, to separate the cereal heads from the stalks and then use threshing sleds to disengage the grain. They then winnowed the grain/chaff mixture.\\r\\nThe Tigris-Euphrates plain lacked minerals and trees. Sumerian structures were made of plano-convex mudbrick, not fixed with mortar or cement. Mud-brick buildings eventually deteriorate, so they were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This constant rebuilding gradually raised the level of cities, which thus came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resultant hills, known as tells, are found throughout the ancient Near East.\\r\\nAccording to Archibald Sayce, the primitive pictograms of the early Sumerian (i.e. Uruk) era suggest that \\"Stone was scarce, but was already cut into blocks and seals. Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities, forts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a tower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a hinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a larger scale, and seems to have been double. The foundation stones  or rather bricks  of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them.\\"[34]\\r\\nThe most impressive and famous of Sumerian buildings are the ziggurats, large layered platforms that supported temples. Sumerian cylinder seals also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those built by the Marsh Arabs of Southern Iraq until as recently as 400 CE. The Sumerians also developed the arch, which enabled them to develop a strong type of dome. They built this by constructing and linking several arches. Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques,[citation needed] such as buttresses, recesses, half columns, and clay nails.\\r\\nThe Sumerians developed a complex system of metrology c. 4000 BC. This advanced metrology resulted in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.[60] The period c. 2700 ÿ 2300 BC saw the first appearance of the abacus, and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system.[61] The Sumerians were the first to use a place value numeral system. There is also anecdotal evidence the Sumerians may have used a type of slide rule in astronomical calculations. They were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube.[62]\\r\\nDiscoveries of obsidian from far-away locations in Anatolia and lapis lazuli from Badakhshan in northeastern Afghanistan, beads from Dilmun (modern Bahrain), and several seals inscribed with the Indus Valley script suggest a remarkably wide-ranging network of ancient trade centered on the Persian Gulf. For example, Imports to Ur came from many parts of the world. In particular, the metals of all types had to be imported.\\r\\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh refers to trade with far lands for goods, such as wood, that were scarce in Mesopotamia. In particular, cedar from Lebanon was prized. The finding of resin in the tomb of Queen Puabi at Ur, indicates it was traded from as far away as Mozambique.\\r\\nThe Sumerians used slaves, although they were not a major part of the economy. Slave women worked as weavers, pressers, millers, and porters.\\r\\nSumerian potters decorated pots with cedar oil paints. The potters used a bow drill to produce the fire needed for baking the pottery. Sumerian masons and jewelers knew and made use of alabaster (calcite), ivory, iron, gold, silver, carnelian, and lapis lazuli.[63]\\r\\nLarge institutions kept their accounts in barley and silver, often with a fixed rate between them. The obligations, loans and prices in general were usually denominated in one of them. Many transactions involved debt, for example goods consigned to merchants by temple and beer advanced by \\"ale women\\".[64]\\r\\nCommercial credit and agricultural consumer loans were the main types of loans. The trade credit was usually extended by temples in order to finance trade expeditions and was nominated in silver. The interest rate was set at 1/60 a month (one shekel per mina) some time before 2000 BC and it remained at that level for about two thousand years.[64] Rural loans commonly arose as a result of unpaid obligations due to an institution (such as a temple), in this case the arrears were considered to be lent to the debtor.[65] They were denominated in barley or other crops and the interest rate was typically much higher than for commercial loans and could amount to 1/3 to 1/2 of the loan principal.[64]\\r\\nPeriodically, rulers signed \\"clean slate\\" decrees that cancelled all the rural (but not commercial) debt and allowed bondservants to return to their homes. Customarily, rulers did it at the beginning of the first full year of their reign, but they could also be proclaimed at times of military conflict or crop failure. The first known ones were made by Enmetena and Urukagina of Lagash in 2400-2350 BC. According to Hudson, the purpose of these decrees was to prevent debts mounting to a degree that they threatened the fighting force, which could happen if peasants lost the subsistence land or became bondservants due to the inability to repay the debt.[64]\\r\\nThe almost constant wars among the Sumerian city-states for 2000 years helped to develop the military technology and techniques of Sumer to a high level.[66] The first war recorded in any detail was between Lagash and Umma in c. 2525 BC on a stele called the Stele of the Vultures. It shows the king of Lagash leading a Sumerian army consisting mostly of infantry. The infantry carried spears, wore copper helmets, and carried rectangular shields. The spearmen are shown arranged in what resembles the phalanx formation, which requires training and discipline; this implies that the Sumerians may have made use of professional soldiers.[67]\\r\\nThe Sumerian military used carts harnessed to onagers. These early chariots functioned less effectively in combat than did later designs, and some have suggested that these chariots served primarily as transports, though the crew carried battle-axes and lances. The Sumerian chariot comprised a four or two-wheeled device manned by a crew of two and harnessed to four onagers. The cart was composed of a woven basket and the wheels had a solid three-piece design.\\r\\nSumerian cities were surrounded by defensive walls. The Sumerians engaged in siege warfare between their cities, but the mudbrick walls were able to deter some foes.\\r\\nExamples of Sumerian technology include: the wheel, cuneiform script, arithmetic and geometry, irrigation systems, Sumerian boats, lunisolar calendar, bronze, leather, saws, chisels, hammers, braces, bits, nails, pins, rings, hoes, axes, knives, lancepoints, arrowheads, swords, glue, daggers, waterskins, bags, harnesses, armor, quivers, war chariots, scabbards, boots, sandals, harpoons and beer. The Sumerians had three main types of boats:\\r\\nEvidence of wheeled vehicles appeared in the mid 4th millennium BC, near-simultaneously in Mesopotamia, the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture) and Central Europe. The wheel initially took the form of the potter's wheel. The new concept quickly led to wheeled vehicles and mill wheels. The Sumerians' cuneiform script is the oldest (or second oldest after the Egyptian hieroglyphs) which has been deciphered (the status of even older inscriptions such as the Jiahu symbols and Tartaria tablets is controversial). The Sumerians were among the first astronomers, mapping the stars into sets of constellations, many of which survived in the zodiac and were also recognized by the ancient Greeks.[68] They were also aware of the five planets that are easily visible to the naked eye.[69]\\r\\nThey invented and developed arithmetic by using several different number systems including a mixed radix system with an alternating base 10 and base 6. This sexagesimal system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia. They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between infantry, cavalry, and archers. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. The first true city-states arose in Sumer, roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now Syria and Lebanon. Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records, and other pursuits. Conjointly with the spread of writing, the first formal schools were established, usually under the auspices of a city-state's primary temple.\\r\\nFinally, the Sumerians ushered in domestication with intensive agriculture and irrigation. Emmer wheat, barley, sheep (starting as mouflon), and cattle (starting as aurochs) were foremost among the species cultivated and raised for the first time on a grand scale.\\r\\nGeography\\r\\nLanguage\\r\\nCoordinates: 3200N 4530E? / ?32.0N 45.5E? / 32.0; 45.5","input":"Where did the ancient civilization of sumer develop?"},{"output":"3.2 miles","context":"Medford is a city 3.2 miles northwest of downtown Boston on the Mystic River in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. In the 2010 U.S. Census, Medford's population was 56,173. It is home to Tufts University.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMedford was settled in 1630 as part of Charlestown.[2] The area was originally called \\"Mistick\\" by Thomas Dudley (a name which persisted for many decades), which his party renamed \\"Meadford\\".[3] The name may have come from a description of the \\"meadow by the ford\\" in the Mystic River, or from two locations in England that Cradock may have known: the hamlet of Mayford or Metford in Staffordshire near Caverswall, or from the parish of Maidford or Medford (now Towcester, Northamptonshire).[4] In 1634, the land north of the Mystic River became the private plantation of former Governor Matthew Cradock; across the river was Ten Hills Farm, which belonged to John Winthrop, Governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony.[5]\\r\\nIn 1637, the first bridge (a toll bridge) across the Mystic River was built at the site of the present-day Cradock Bridge, which carries Main Street into Medford Square.[6] It would be the only bridge across the Mystic until 1787, and as such became a major route for traffic coming into Boston from the north (though ferries and fords were also used).[7] The bridge would be rebuilt in 1880 and 1909.[6]\\r\\nUntil 1656, all of northern Medford was owned by Cradock, his heirs, or Edward Collins. Medford was governed as a \\"peculiar\\" or private plantation. As the land began to be divided among several people from different families, the new owners began to meet and make decisions locally and increasingly independently from the Charlestown town meeting. In 1674, a Board of Selectmen was elected, in 1684, the colonial legislature granted the ability to raise money independently, and in 1689, a representative to the legislature was chosen. The town got its own religious meeting room in 1690, and a secular meeting house in 1696.[7]\\r\\nIn 1692, the town engaged its first ordained preacher, Rev. John Hancock Sr., grandfather to John Hancock, first and third Governor of Massachusetts and famous revolutionary figure; during his time of service Rev. Hancock lived in Medford, serving until November 1693.[8][7]\\r\\nThe land south of the Mystic River, present-day South Medford, was originally known as \\"Mistick Field\\". It was transferred from Charlestown to Medford in 1754.[9] This grant also included the \\"Charlestown woodlots\\" (the Medford part of the Middlesex Fells), and part of what was at the time Woburn (now Winchester).[10] Other parts of Medford were transferred to Charlestown in 1811, Winchester in 1850 (\\"Upper Medford\\"), and Malden in 1879. Additional land was transferred to Medford from Malden (1817), Everett (1875), and Malden (1877) again.[4][11]\\r\\nThe population of Medford went from 230 in 1700 to 1,114 in 1800. After 1880, the population rapidly expanded, reaching 18,244 by 1900.[12] Farmland was divided into lots and sold to build residential and commercial buildings, starting in the 1840s and 1850s; government services expanded with the population (schools, police, post office) and technological advancement (gas lighting, electricity, telephones, railways).[11] Tufts University was chartered in 1852 and the Crane Theological School at Tufts opened in 1869.\\r\\nMedford was incorporated as a city in 1892, and was a center of industry, including the manufacture of tiles and crackers,[13] bricks,[14] rum,[15] and clipper ships,[16] such as the White Swallow and the Kingfisher, both built by Hayden & Cudworth.[17]\\r\\nDuring the 17th century, a handful of major public roads (High Street, Main Street, Salem Street, \\"the road to Stoneham\\", and South Street) served the population, but the road network started a long-term expansion in the 18th century.[18] The Medford Turnpike Company was incorporated in 1803, but turned what is now Mystic Avenue over to the city in 1866. The Andover Turnpike Company was incorporated in 1805, but turned what is now Forest Street and Fellsway West over to Medford in 1830.[11]\\r\\nOther major commercial transportation projects included the Middlesex Canal by 1803,[19] the Boston and Lowell Railroad in West Medford in the 1830s, and the Boston and Maine Railroad to Medford Center in 1847.\\r\\nA horse-powered street railway began running to Somerville and Charlestown in 1860. The street railway network expanded in the hands of various private companies, and went electric in the late 1890s, when trolleys to Everett and downtown Boston were available.[11] Streetcars were converted to buses in the 20th century. Interstate 93 was constructed between 1956 and 1963.[20]\\r\\nIn 1868, a French astronomer and naturalist, Leopold Trouvelot, was attempting to breed a better silkworm using Gypsy moths. Several of the moths escaped from his home, at 27 Myrtle Street. Within ten years, the insect had denuded the vegetation in the neighborhood. It spread over North America.[21][22]\\r\\nIn a tavern and boarding house on High Street (Simpson's Tavern) in the late 19th century, local resident James Pierpont wrote \\"Jingle Bells\\" after watching a sleigh race from Medford to Malden. Another local resident, Lydia Maria Child (1802ÿ1880), made a poem out of the trip across town to her grandparents' house, now the classic song \\"Over the River and Through the Wood\\".\\r\\nPaul Revere's famous midnight ride traveled along Main Street, continuing onto High Street in Medford Square. An annual re-enactment takes place honoring the historic event.\\r\\nThe Peter Tufts House (350 Riverside Ave.) is thought to be the oldest all-brick building in New England. Another important site is the \\"Slave Wall\\" on Grove Street, built by \\"Pomp,\\" a slave owned by the prominent Brooks family. The Isaac Royall House, which once belonged to one of Harvard Law School's founders, Isaac Royall, Jr., is a National Historic Landmark and a local history museum. The house was used by Continental Army troops, including George Washington and John Stark, during the American Revolutionary War.\\r\\nGeorge Luther Stearns, an American industrialist and one of John Brown's Secret Six. His passion for the abolitionist cause shaped his life, bringing him into contact with the likes of Abraham Lincoln and Ralph Waldo Emerson and starting The Nation magazine. He was given the rank of major by Massachusetts Governor John Andrew and spent most of the Civil War recruiting for the 54th and 55th Massachusetts regiments and the 5th cavalry.\\r\\nMedford was home to Fannie Farmer, author of one of the world's most famous cookbooksas well as James Plimpton, the man credited with the 1863 invention of the first practical four-wheeled roller skate, which set off a roller craze that quickly spread across the United States and Europe.[23]\\r\\nAmelia Earhart lived in Medford while working as a social worker in 1925.\\r\\nElizabeth Short, the victim of an infamous Hollywood murder and who became known as The Black Dahlia, was born in Hyde Park (the southernmost neighborhood of the city of Boston, Massachusetts) but raised in Medford before going to the West Coast looking for fame.\\r\\nMedford has sent more than its share of athletes to the National Hockey League; Shawn Bates, though born in Melrose, MA grew up in Medford, as did Keith Tkachuk, Mike Morrison, David Sacco, and Joe Sacco. Former Red Sox pitcher Bill Monbouquette grew up in Medford.\\r\\nMedford was home to Michael Bloomberg, American businessman, philanthropist, and the founder of Bloomberg L.P.. He was the Mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013. Mayor Bloomberg attended Medford High School and resided in Medford until after he graduated from college at Johns Hopkins University.[24] His mother remained a resident of Medford until her death in 2011.\\r\\nThe only cryobank of amniotic stem cells in the United States is located in Medford, built by Biocell Center, a biotechnology company led by Giuseppe Simoni.\\r\\nMedford was the location of some famous crimes:\\r\\nMedford is located at 422512N 71629W? / ?42.42000N 71.10806W? / 42.42000; -71.10806 (42.419996, ?71.107942).[26]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 8.6 square miles (22?km2), of which, 8.1 square miles (21?km2) of it is land and 0.5 square miles (1.3?km2) of it (5.79%) is water.\\r\\nA park called the Middlesex Fells Reservation, to the north, is partly within the city.

South Medford is a traditionally Italian neighborhood. West Medford, the most affluent of Medford's many neighborhoods, was once the bastion of some of Boston's elite families including Peter Chardon Brooks, one of the wealthiest men in post-colonial America, and father-in-law to Charles Francis Adams  and is also home to an historic African-American neighborhood that dates to the Civil War.[40]\\r\\nAs of the census[41] of 2010, there were 56,173 people, 22,810 households, and 13,207 families residing in the city.

They may be manual devices powered by hand or foot movements or electrical devices powered by batteries or electricity from the grid.  Breast pumps, like lactation rooms, are most common in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 20, 1854, the United States Patent Office issued Patent No. 11,135 to O.H. Needham for a breast pump.[1][2] Scientific American (1863) credits L.O. Colbin as the inventor and patent applicant of a breast pump.[3] In 1921-23, engineer and chess master Edward Lasker produced a mechanical breast pump that imitated an infant's sucking action and was regarded by physicians as a marked improvement on existing hand-operated breast pumps, which failed to remove all the milk from the breast.[4] The U.S. Patent Office issued U.S. Patent 1,644,257 for Lasker's breast pump.[5] In 1956 Einar Egnell published his groundbreaking work, \\"Viewpoints on what happens mechanically in the female breast during various methods of milk collection\\".[6] This article provided insight into the technical aspects of milk extraction from the breast. Many Egnell SMB breast pumps designed through this research are still in operation over 50 years after publication.\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeologists working at a glass factory site in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, excavated a 19th-century breast pipe that matches breast pumping instruments in period advertisements.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBreast pumps are used for many reasons. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany parents use them to continue breastfeeding after they return to work. They express their milk at work, which is later bottle-fed to their child by a caregiver. This use of breast milk is widespread in the United States, where paid family leave is one of the shortest in the developed world.  American historian Jill Lepore argues that the need for so-called \\"lactation rooms\\" and breast pumps is driven by the corporate desire for parents to return to work immediately rather than mothers' wishes or babies' needs.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA breast pump may also be used to stimulate lactation for women with a low milk supply or those who have not just given birth. \\r\\n\\r\\nA breast pump may be also used to address a range of challenges parents may encounter breast feeding, including difficulties latching, separation from an infant in intensive care, to feed an infant who cannot extract sufficient milk itself from the breast, to avoid passing medication through breast milk to the baby, or to relieve engorgement, a painful condition whereby the breasts are overfull.  Pumping may also be desirable to continue lactation and its associated hormones to aid in recovery from pregnancy even if the pumped milk is not used.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2012 policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \\"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\\" including lower rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).\\r\\n[11] When infants are unable to suckle, mothers can pump if they wish their babies to be fed (via naso-gastric tube) with the mothers' own milk.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExpressing milk for donation is another use for breast pumps. Donor milk may be available from milk banks for babies who are not able to receive their mothers' milk. [13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breast pump is not as efficient at removing milk from the breast as most nursing babies.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch done at Stanford University in 2009 showed the correlation of various factors with the volume of milk production in mothers of preterm babies (born before the 31st week of gestation).[15] The research found that breast massage in addition to a breast pump (a technique called \\"hands-on pumping\\", or HOP), along with other factors correlated to higher milk production. The study found that mothers who used massage techniques and hand expression more than 5 times a day in the first 3 days after birth increased their milk production 8 weeks later, milk production increased 48%. The authors produced a video showing the technique and states that this technique is good for both mothers of premature infants as well as mothers that return to work or pump for other purposes.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nA second article on the same study found that the combination of HOP techniques increased the fat content of the milk expressed.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nMechanically, a breast pump triggers the milk ejection response or \\"letdown\\". A misconception is that the breast pump suctions milk out of the breast.  Pumps achieve letdown by using suction to pull the nipple into the tunnel of the breast shield or flange, then release, which counts as one cycle. Thirty to sixty cycles per minute can be expected with better-quality electric breast pumps. This suction-release cycle can also be accomplished with hand pumps, which the nursing parent operates by compressing a handle.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMost manufacturers make multiple sizes of nipple tunnels ranging from 24mm to 36mm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several pump mechanisms. Piston pumps draw a piston through a cylinder to create suction. These tend to operate at low speed, have high reliability, low noise, and long life.  Rotary vane pumps use a cam with retractable vanes to create suction and are no longer widely used. Fast-diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, and can operate at thousands of cycles per minute.  They tend to be noisy. Slow-diaphragm pumps use a larger diaphragm operated by a cam or lever to generate suction with each stroke.  Pumps have also been designed that use venturi effects powered by a faucet or water stream, wall suction in hospitals, or oral suctioning. \\r\\n\\r\\nManual breast pumps are operated by squeezing or pulling a handle in a repetitive fashion, allowing the user to directly control the pressure and frequency of milk expression.  Though manual pumps are small and inexpensive, they can require significant effort and can be tiring because the user provides all the power.  These pumps may not provide sufficient stimulation and emptying of the breast. \\"Bicycle-horn\\" style manual pumps can damage breast tissue and harbor bacteria in the rubber suction bulb, which is difficult to clean.[18][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nFoot-powered breast pumps use the same collection tubing and breast horns as electric breast pumps, but are powered by a foot pedal. This eliminates the work of pumping by hand or the need for finding an electrical outlet with privacy.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two types of electric breast pumps, hospital-grade and personal-use. Hospital-grade pumps are larger and intended for multiple users. Personal-use pumps are generally intended for one user. Electric breast pumps are powered by a motor which supplies suction through plastic tubing to a horn that fits over the nipple. The portions of the pump that come into direct contact with the expressed milk must be sterilized to prevent contamination. This style provides more suction, making pumping significantly faster, and allows users to pump both their breasts at the same time. Electric breast pumps are larger than manual ones, but portable models are available (e.g. in a backpack or shoulder bag). Some models include battery packs or built-in batteries to enable portable operation of the pump. Some electric pumps allow multi-user operation, but recommend an accessory kit for each user to maintain cleanliness.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nRental pumps may be recommended when medical conditions temporarily preclude breastfeeding.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome breast pumps are designed to be part of a \\"feeding system\\" so that the milk storage portion of the pump is the baby bottle used to feed the infant. This allows the milk to be collected in the same bottle that will feed the baby eliminating the need to transfer breastmilk. Freezable breastmilk storage bags are available that connect directly to some breast pumps and can then be used with disposable bottle feeding systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nEgnell in 1956 established a 220 mmHg safe maximum for automatic cycling pumps; however, there have been reports of sensitive breasts and nipples at much lower pressures. Hartman P, et al. in the 2008 study[23] showed that the maximum comfortable vacuum enhances milk flow and milk yield.\\r\\n\\r\\nPump designs are referred to as either open or closed based on whether there is a barrier between where the tubing connects to the pump and where milk flows into the pump. The plastic tubing and horn of an electric breast pump are commonly referred to as the collection system and typically supply the pump's suction. \\r\\n\\r\\nA closed collection system has a barrier or diaphragm that separates the pump tubing from the horn. In this design, the suction of the pump motor lifts the diaphragm to create a vacuum within the collection system to extract milk. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, an open system does not have a barrier between the tubing and the horn. Bacteria and viral filters may be present to prevent contamination or overflow into pump motor. The pump motor's suction is directly passed to the breast versus indirectly as with closed-diaphragm systems.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen-collection systems can cause milk to overflow into the collection system tubing, and milk particles being drawn into the pump motor. If milk leaks into the pump's tubing, the tubes should be washed, sterilized and air-dried prior to using the pump again. Failure to thoroughly clean collection tubing may lead to mold growth within the tubing. Some models of pumps have bacteria and overflow filters which prevent milk from entering the tubing.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nA subtype of the open-collection system is the single-user suction source. These pumps have added hygienic benefit in that all the parts that generate the suction and come in contact with breast milk stay with the mother. The parts that generate the suction are external to the pump, and can be removed, preventing cross contamination. These pumps are considered \\"hospital grade\\" and virtually eliminate the chance of cross contamination of the pump from user to user.[24]   However, it is important to clean the diaphragm as condensation or milk reaching this part can cause bacterial contamination. \\r\\n\\r\\nA disadvantage of the diaphragm is that it may limit the amount of air/suction available to extract milk from the breast. It may also not be able to compensate for larger shield sizes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are no studies comparing the open- versus closed-system design. Most information in marketing materials by breast-pump manufacturers is offered without studies to back them up.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost breast pumps direct the pumped milk into a container that can be used for storage and feeding. Some manufacturers offer adapters to fit a variety of types and sizes of bottles, enabling more flexibility to mix and match products of different brands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expressed breast milk (EBM) may be stored and later fed to a baby by bottle.  Expressed milk may be kept at room temperature for up to six hours (at 66-72 degrees Fahrenheit, around 20 degrees Celsius), refrigerated for up to 8 days, or frozen for 12 months in a deep freeze separate from a refrigerator maintained at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or ?18 degrees Celsius.  Expressed milk may be donated to milk banks, which provide human breast milk to premature infants and other children whose mothers cannot provide for them.[25]","input":"When was the first electric breast pump invented?"},{"output":"Plexicushion","context":"The Australian Open is a major tennis tournament held annually over the last fortnight of January in Melbourne, Australia. First held in 1905, the tournament is chronologically the first of the four Grand Slam tennis events of the year?ÿ the other three being the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. It features men's and women's singles; men's, women's and mixed doubles and junior's championships; as well as wheelchair, legends and exhibition events. Prior to 1988 the tournament had been played on grass courts, but since then two types of hardcourt surfaces have been used at Melbourne Park ÿ green coloured Rebound Ace up to 2007 and, afterwards, blue Plexicushion.[1]\\r\\nThe Australian Open typically has high attendances, rivalling and occasionally exceeding the US Open. The tournament holds the record for the highest attendance at a Grand Slam event.[c] It was the first Grand Slam tournament to feature indoor play during wet weather or extreme heat with its three primary courts, the Rod Laver Arena, Hisense Arena and the refurbished Margaret Court Arena equipped with retractable roofs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Open is managed by Tennis Australia, formerly the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia (LTAA), and was first played at the Warehouseman's Cricket Ground in Melbourne in November 1905. This facility is now known as the Albert Reserve Tennis Centre.[2]\\r\\nThe tournament was first known as the Australasian Championships and then became the Australian Championships in 1927 and the Australian Open in 1969.[3] Since 1905, the Australian Open has been staged in five Australian and two New Zealand cities: Melbourne (55 times), Sydney (17 times), Adelaide (14 times), Brisbane (7 times), Perth (3 times), Christchurch (1906) and Hastings (1912).[3] Though started in 1905, the tournament was not designated as being a major championship until 1924, by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) at a 1923 meeting. The tournament committee changed the structure of the tournament to include seeding at that time.[4] In 1972, it was decided to stage the tournament in Melbourne each year because it attracted the biggest patronage of any Australian city.[2] The tournament was played at the Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club from 1972 until the move to the new Melbourne Park complex in 1988.\\r\\nThe new facilities at Melbourne Park (formerly Flinders Park) were envisaged to meet the demands of a tournament that had outgrown Kooyong's capacity. The move to Melbourne Park was an immediate success, with a 90 percent increase in attendance in 1988 (266,436) on the previous year at Kooyong (140,000).[5]\\r\\nBecause of Australia's geographic remoteness, very few foreign players entered this tournament in the early 20th century. In the 1920s, the trip by ship from Europe to Australia took about 45 days. The first tennis players who came by boats were the US Davis Cup players in November 1946.[5] Even inside the country, many players could not travel easily. When the tournament was held in Perth, no one from Victoria or New South Wales crossed by train, a distance of about 3,000 kilometres (1,900?mi) between the east and west coasts. In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended and the tournament was won by a New Zealander.[6]\\r\\nThe first tournaments of the Australasian Championships suffered from the competition of the other Australasian tournaments. Before 1905, all Australian states and New Zealand had their own championships, the first organised in 1880 in Melbourne and called the Championship of the Colony of Victoria (later the Championship of Victoria).[7] In those years, the best two players?ÿ Australian Norman Brookes (whose name is now written on the men's singles cup) and New Zealander Anthony Wilding?ÿ almost did not play this tournament. Brookes came once and won in 1911, and Wilding entered and won the competition twice (1906 and 1909). Their meetings in the Victorian Championships (or at Wimbledon) helped to determine the best Australasian players. Even when the Australasian Championships were held in Hastings, New Zealand, in 1912, Wilding, though three times Wimbledon champion, did not come back to his home country. It was a recurring problem for all players of the era. Brookes went to Europe only three times, where he reached the Wimbledon Challenge Round once and then won Wimbledon twice. Thus, many players had never played the Austral(as)ian amateur or open championships: the Doherty brothers, William Larned, Maurice McLoughlin, Beals Wright, Bill Johnston, Bill Tilden, Ren Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Bobby Riggs, Jack Kramer, Ted Schroeder, Pancho Gonzales, Budge Patty, and others, while Brookes, Ellsworth Vines, Jaroslav Drobny, came just once. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, when travel was less difficult, leading players such as Manuel Santana, Jan Kode?, Manuel Orantes, Ilie N?stase (who only came once, when 35 years old) and Bj?rn Borg came rarely or not at all.\\r\\nBeginning in 1969, when the first Australian Open was held on the Milton Courts at Brisbane, the tournament was open to all players, including professionals who were not allowed to play the traditional circuit.[8] Nevertheless, except for the 1969 and 1971 tournaments, many of the best players missed this championship until 1982, because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year's Day) and the low prize money. In 1970, George MacCall's National Tennis League, which employed Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Andrs Gimeno, Pancho Gonzales, Roy Emerson and Fred Stolle, prevented its players from entering the tournament because the guarantees were insufficient. The tournament was won by Arthur Ashe.[9]\\r\\nIn 1983, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Mats Wilander entered the tournament. Wilander won the singles title[10] and both his Davis Cup singles rubbers in the Swedish loss to Australia at Kooyong shortly after.[11] Following the 1983 Australian Open, the International Tennis Federation prompted the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia to change the site of the tournament, because the Kooyong stadium was then inappropriate to serve such a big event. In 1988 the tournament was first held at Flinders Park (later renamed Melbourne Park).[12] The change of the venue also led to a change of the court surface from grass to a hard court surface known as Rebound Ace.[13] Mats Wilander was the only player to win the tournament on both grass and hard courts. In 2008, after being used for 20 years, the Rebound Ace was replaced by a cushioned, medium-paced,[14] acrylic surface known as Plexicushion Prestige. Roger Federer and Serena Williams are the only players to win the Australian Open on both Rebound Ace and Plexicushion Prestige. The main benefits of the new surface are better consistency and less retention of heat because of a thinner top layer.[13] This change was accompanied by changes in the surfaces of all lead-up tournaments to the Australian Open. The change was controversial because of the new surface's similarity to DecoTurf, the surface used by the US Open.[15]\\r\\nBefore the Melbourne Park stadium era, tournament dates fluctuated as well, in particular in the early years because of the climate of each site or exceptional events. For example, the 1919 tournament was held in January 1920 (the 1920 tournament was played in March) and the 1923 tournament in Brisbane took place in August when the weather was not too hot and wet. After a first 1977 tournament was held in December 1976?ÿ January 1977, the organisers chose to move the next tournament forward a few days, then a second 1977 tournament was played (ended on 31 December), but this failed to attract the best players. From 1982 to 1985, the tournament was played in mid-December. Then it was decided to move the next tournament to mid-January (January 1987), which meant there was no tournament in 1986. Since 1987, the Australian Open date has not changed. However, some top players, including Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, have said that the tournament is held too soon after the Christmas and New Year holidays, thus preventing players from reaching their best form, and expressed a desire to shift it to February.[16] Such a change, however, would move the tournament outside the summer school holiday period, potentially impacting attendance figures.\\r\\nAnother change of venue was proposed in 2008, with New South Wales authorities making clear their desire to bid for hosting rights to the tournament once Melbourne's contract expires in 2016.[17] In response, Wayne Kayler-Thomson, the head of the Victorian Events Industry Council, was adamant that Melbourne should retain the event. In a scathing attack of the New South Wales authorities, he said, \\"It is disappointing that NSW cannot be original and seek their own events instead of trying to cannibalise other Australian cities.\\"[18] Since the proposal was made, a major redevelopment of Melbourne Park has been announced, which is expected to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Melbourne Park will include upgraded and increased seating in major venues, a roof over Margaret Court Arena, improved player facilities, a new headquarters for Tennis Australia and a partly covered \\"town square\\" area featuring large televisions showing current tennis play.[19] A year later, these plans were largely approved, with former Premier of Victoria John Brumby confirming the state government's willingness to commit A$363?million to complete the renovations, a move which guaranteed there will be no change of venue until at least beyond 2036.[20]\\r\\nThe Australian Open is broadcast globally on television and online through some of the most established broadcasters in world sports. In Australia, the Australian Open has been broadcast by the Seven Network since 1973. Between 2003 and 2009, it was co-broadcast by Fox Sports. The Australian Open men's singles final is traditionally one of the most watched sports events in Australia. In the rest of Asia-Pacific, Fox Sports broadcasts it across South-East Asia, Wowow and NHK in Japan, CCTV, Shanghai TV and iQiyi in China, Sony Six in India and the Sub-Continent, Sky in New Zealand and Fiji TV across Oceania-Pacific.\\r\\nIn Europe the tournament is broadcast on Eurosport. Other broadcasters in the region have included the BBC in the United Kingdom, SRG in Switzerland, NOS in Netherlands and RTS in Serbia. In the United Kingdom, the BBC dropped its live coverage of the 2016 tournament just a month before the start due to budget cuts, leaving Eurosport as the exclusive live broadcaster.[21]\\r\\nElsewhere, beIN Sports broadcasts it into the Middle East and Northern Africa, and SuperSport in Sub-Sahara Africa. In the United States, the tournament is broadcast on ESPN2, ESPN3 and the Tennis Channel.[22] The championship matches are televised live on ESPN. While it is broadcast on ESPN International in Central and Latin America. It is broadcast on TSN in Canada.\\r\\nThe following record of attendance provides a consistent year-to-year comparison given that since 1987 all tournaments have been played in the January period of the year (the immediate preceding tournament was Dec 1985). 1987 was the last year that the Kooyong Tennis Club was host to the grand slam and since 1988 Melbourne Park has hosted all tournaments. The average growth rate over the period covered below is 7% compared to 3% for the same period for the US Open attendance.\\r\\nThe prize money awarded in the men's and women's singles tournaments is distributed equally. The total prize money for the 2017 tournament is AUD $50,000,000. In 2017 the prize money is to be distributed as follows:[52]\\r\\n* per team\\r\\nNote: All amounts in Australian dollars.

It is the highest prize money for a tennis tournament. It was announced the prize money will be increased to AUD $40 million from 2015 onwards.\\r\\nThe names of the tournament winners are inscribed on the perpetual trophy cups.\\r\\nRanking points for the men (ATP) and women (WTA) have varied at the Australian Open through the years but presently players receive the following points:\\r\\nAustralian Open champions listed by event:\\r\\nRoger Federer was the winner of the Men's Singles in 2017.

Currently 3 of the courts used have retractable roofs, allowing play to continue during rain and extreme heat. As of 2017 spectators can also observe play at show courts 2 and 3, which have capacities of 3,000 each,[53] as well as at Courts 7-15, 19 and 20 from small accessible viewing positions.[54]\\r\\nConstruction of a new 5,000 seat capacity stadium will start in 2019 as part of a $271 million redevelopment of the precinct.[55]\\r\\nSince 2008, all of the courts used during the Australian Open are hard courts with Plexicushion acrylic surfaces (though Melbourne Park does have 8 clay courts not used for the tournament). This replaced the Rebound Ace surface used from the opening of Melbourne Park. The ITF rates the surfaces speed as medium.[56]\\r\\nUnlike the other three Grand Slam tournaments, which became open in 1968, the Australian tournament opened to professionals in 1969.

United or simply United, is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Nicknamed \\"the Red Devils\\", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester United have won more trophies than any other club in English football,[3][4] with a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, 5 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. United have also won three UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998ÿ99, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the treble of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League.[5] By winning the UEFA Europa League in 2016ÿ17, they became one of five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions, and the only English club to have won every ongoing top-flight honour available to them.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United became the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies as manager, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and 2013,[7][8][9] when he announced his retirement. Jos Mourinho is the club's current manager, having been appointed on 27 May 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016ÿ17, with an annual revenue of ?676.3?million,[10] and the world's most valuable football club in 2018, valued at S3.1?billion.[11] As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2?billion.[12][13] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost S800?million, after which the company was taken private again, before going public once more in August 2012, when they made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world,[14][15] and has rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, and Leeds United.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[16] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company ÿ green and gold ÿ they were defeated 6ÿ0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team.[17] By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with the Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892ÿ93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \\"LYR\\" from its name.[16] After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1902, with debts of S2,670 ÿ equivalent to S270,000 in 2018[nb 1] ÿ the club was served with a winding-up order.[18] Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who became club president), each willing to invest S500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;[19] on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.[20][nb 2] Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 ÿ the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield[21] and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested S2,000 and assumed control of the club.[23] In the 1938ÿ39 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1945, the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.[24] Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.[25] With an average age of 22, the back-to-back title winning side of 1956 were labelled \\"the Busby Babes\\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players.[26] In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season.[27] En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10ÿ0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players?ÿ Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan?ÿ and injured several more.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAssistant manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club to compete in the 1958ÿ59 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from the FA, the Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.[31][32] Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players ÿ including George Best ÿ to win the FA Cup in 1963. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English (and second British) club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4ÿ1 in the final[33] with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best.[34] Matt Busby resigned as manager in 1969 and was replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing an eighth-place finish in the 1969ÿ70 season and a poor start to the 1970ÿ71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18?months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972.[37] Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.[33] The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2ÿ1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.[35][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nDave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to achieve any significant results; they finished in the top two in 1979ÿ80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup Final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction.[39] He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years ÿ in 1983 and 1985. In 1985ÿ86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league, but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal,[41] and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league.[42] Despite a second-place finish in 1987ÿ88, the club was back in 11th place the following season.[43] Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay (after a 3ÿ3 draw) saved Ferguson's career.[44][45] The following season, Manchester United claimed its first Cup Winners' Cup title and competed in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup, beating European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1ÿ0 in the final at Old Trafford. A second consecutive League Cup final appearance followed in 1992, in which the team beat Nottingham Forest 1ÿ0 at Wembley.[40] In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive title ÿ alongside the FA Cup ÿ to complete the first \\"Double\\" in the club's history.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1998ÿ99 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League ÿ \\"The Treble\\" ÿ in the same season.[47] Losing 1ÿ0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskj?r scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time.[48] The club also won the Intercontinental Cup after beating Palmeiras 1ÿ0 in Tokyo.[49] Ferguson was subsequently knighted for his services to football.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester United won the league again in the 1999ÿ2000 and 2000ÿ01 seasons. The team finished third in 2001ÿ02, before regaining the title in 2002ÿ03.[51] They won the 2003ÿ04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3ÿ0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time.[52] In the 2005ÿ06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade,[53] but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup Final. The club regained the Premier League in the 2006ÿ07 and 2007ÿ08 seasons, and completed the European double by beating Chelsea 6ÿ5 on penalties in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in this game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton.[54] In December 2008, the club won the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup and followed this with the 2008ÿ09 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title.[55][56] That summer, Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record S80?million.[57] In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2ÿ1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter finishing as runner-up to Chelsea in the 2009ÿ10 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010ÿ11, securing the championship with a 1ÿ1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011.[59] This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012ÿ13, securing the championship with a 3ÿ0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador.[61][62] The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract.[63][64][65] Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995ÿ96.[66] They also failed to qualify for the Europa League, meaning that it was the first time Manchester United hadn't qualified for a European competition since 1990.[67] On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.[68] Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the Glazer family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Van Gaal's first season saw United once again qualify for the Champions League through a fourth-place finish in the Premier League, his second season saw United go out of the same tournament in the group stage.[70] United also fell behind in the title race for the third consecutive season, finishing in 5th place, in spite of several expensive signings during Van Gaal's tenure. However, that same season, Manchester United won the FA Cup for a 12th time, this being their first major trophy won since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.[71] Despite this victory, Van Gaal was sacked as manager just two days later,[72] with Jos Mourinho appointed in his place on 27 May, signing a three-year contract.[73] That season, United finished in sixth place while winning the EFL Cup for the fifth time and the Europa League for the first time, as well as the FA Community Shield for a record 21st time. Despite not finishing in the top four, United qualified for the Champions League through their Europa League win. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal with United, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as United's all-time top scorer, before leaving the club at the end of the season to return to Everton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail.[74] The devil stems from the club's nickname \\"The Red Devils\\"; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'.[75] A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers.[76] Between 1894ÿ96, the players wore distinctive green and gold jerseys[76] which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit.[76] Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red \\"V\\" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup Final. They remained part of their home kits until 1927.[76] For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.[76] The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and/or white socks were sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. For 2018ÿ19, black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit. Since 1997ÿ98, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility.[77] The current home kit is a red shirt with black stripes gradually getting thicker towards the base and the trademark Adidas three stripes in black on the shoulders, black shorts, and red socks with black tops and gradual stripes in between.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999ÿ2000 season,[79] and the 2011ÿ12 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks.[80] An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995ÿ96 season was dropped after just five games, most notoriously against Southampton where Alex Ferguson forced the team to change into the third kit during half-time of its final outing. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit.[81] In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as \\"Manchester United\\", a reversible white/gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club's third kit is often all-blue, this was most recently the case during the 2014ÿ15 season.[83] Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994ÿ95 and 1995ÿ96 seasons and once in 1996ÿ97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998ÿ99 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003ÿ04 and 2005ÿ06.[84] From 2006ÿ07 to 2013ÿ14, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006ÿ07 and 2010ÿ11, apart from 2008ÿ09 when an all-blue kit was launch to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1967ÿ68 European Cup success.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.[86] Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators.[87] Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893.[88] A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary A. H. Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton.[90] It initially had no stands, by the start of the 1893ÿ94 season, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \\"Bradford end\\". At the opposite end, the \\"Clayton end\\", the ground had been \\"built up, thousands thus being provided for\\".[90] Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3ÿ2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later.[90] In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club, and put up another stand on the \\"reserved side\\" (as distinct from the \\"popular side\\"). However, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham.[92] Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid S500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street.[93] Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition;[93] in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around S60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of S30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962?spectators.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nBombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of S22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its \\"home\\" games at Manchester City's Maine Road ground; Manchester United was charged S5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.[95] Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the 1993ÿ94 season.[35] First used on 25 March 1957 and costing S40,000, four 180-foot (55?m) pylons were erected, each housing 54?individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Taylor Report's requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998ÿ99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record.[97] The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4ÿ1, with just 114 seats (0.15?per?cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied.[98] In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957.[99][100] Manchester United has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund.[101][102][103]\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendance in Europe.[104] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries.[105] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75?million fans worldwide,[14] while other estimates put this figure closer to 333?million.[106] The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona and Real Madrid), with over 71 million Facebook fans as of September 2016.[15][107] A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporters are represented by two independent bodies; the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum,[109] and the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST). After the Glazer family's takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, F.C. United of Manchester. The West Stand of Old Trafford ÿ the \\"Stretford End\\" ÿ is the home end and the traditional source of the club's most vocal support.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester United has rivalries with Arsenal, Leeds United, Liverpool, and Manchester City, against whom they contest the Manchester derby.[111][112]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port.[113] The two clubs are the most successful English teams in both domestic and European competitions; and between them they have won 38 league titles, 8 European Cups, 4 UEFA Cups, 4 UEFA Super Cups, 19 FA Cups, 13 League Cups, 1 FIFA Club World Cup, 1 Intercontinental Cup and 36 FA Community Shields.[3][114][115] It is considered to be one of the biggest rivalries in the association football world and is considered the most famous fixture in English football.[116][117][118][119][120]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Roses Rivalry\\" with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses, fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams, as well as managers Alex Ferguson and Arsne Wenger, have battled for the Premier League title. With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match-ups in history.[122][123]\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at S412?million ÿ an increase of S39?million on the previous year, valuing it at S11?million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid ÿ and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong).[124] In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23?billion.[125] The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona).[126] In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3?billion. Forbes Magazine valued the club at $3.3?billion ÿ $1.2?billion higher than the next most valuable sports team.[127] They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689?billion.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim.[110] The \\"iconic\\" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded \\"catenaccio\\" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) \\"captured the imagination of the English footballing public\\".[129] Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the \\"Fifth Beatle\\" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.[130] The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities ÿ the value of which is driven by television exposure.[131] During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal.[133] Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005ÿ06, the club's commercial arm generated S51?million, compared to S42.5?million at Chelsea, S39.3?million at Liverpool, S34?million at Arsenal and S27.9?million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a S303?million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015.[134] Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services ÿ such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV ÿ have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an initial five-year deal worth S500,000, Sharp Electronics became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982ÿ83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999ÿ2000 season, when Vodafone agreed a four-year, S30?million deal.[135] Vodafone agreed to pay S36?million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo commence at the start of the 2006ÿ07 season, American insurance corporation AIG agreed a four-year S56.5?million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world.[136][137] At the beginning of the 2010ÿ11 season, American reinsurance company Aon became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately S80?million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history.[138] Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with DHL reported to be worth S40?million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football.[139][140] The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club's official logistics partner.[141] The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth S180?million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the Trafford Training Centre.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club's first kit manufacturer was Umbro, until a five-year deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear in 1975.[143] Adidas received the contract in 1980,[144] before Umbro started a second spell in 1992.[145] Umbro's sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by Nike's record-breaking S302.9?million deal that lasted until 2015; 3.8?million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company.[146][147] In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level \\"platinum\\" sponsors, including Aon and Budweiser.[148]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014ÿ15 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet.[149][150] Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014ÿ15 season, citing rising costs.[151][152] Since the start of the 2015ÿ16 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of S750?million.[153][154] Plumbing products manufacturer Kohler became the club's first sleeve sponsor ahead of the 2018ÿ19 season.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for S1 via an application form.[19] In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested S500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies.[19] After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of S2,000.[23] Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948,[156] but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian,[157] but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.[158]\\r\\n\\r\\nPromoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately S40,000, he accumulated a 54?per?cent shareholding and took control in January 1964.[159] When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980.[160] Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price.[160] In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for S20?million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising S6.7?million),[161] and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch ÿ now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust ÿ who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover. The Manchester United board accepted a S623?million offer,[162] but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999.[163] A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.[164]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7?per?cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately S800?million (then approx. $1.5?billion).[165] Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange.[166] In July 2006, the club announced a S660?million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30?per?cent reduction in annual interest payments to S62?million a year.[167][168] In January 2010, with debts of S716.5?million ($1.17?billion),[169] Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth S504?million, enabling them to pay off most of the S509?million owed to international banks.[170] The annual interest payable on the bonds ÿ which mature on 1 February 2017 ÿ is approximately S45?million per annum.[171] Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre.[172][173] Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the \\"Red Knights\\", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest.[174]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse in preparation for a $1?billion (approx. S600?million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than S2?billion.[175] However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead.[176] Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3?billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.[177]\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester United are one of the most successful clubs in Europe in terms of trophies won.[217] The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which it won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886.[218] In 1908, the club won its first league title, and won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. Manchester United won the most trophies in the 1990s; five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club holds the record for most top-division titles (20) ÿ including a record 13 Premier League titles ÿ and FA Community Shields (21). It was also the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968, and, as of  2017[update], is the only British club to have won the Club World Cup, in 2008. United also became the sole British club to win the Intercontinental Cup, in 1999. The club's most recent trophy came in May 2017, with the 2016ÿ17 UEFA Europa League.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn winning the 2016ÿ17 UEFA Europa League, United became the fifth club in history to have won the \\"European Treble\\" of European Cup/UEFA Champions League, European Cup Winners' Cup/UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League after Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.[219][220]\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially short competitions such as the Charity/Community Shield, Intercontinental Cup (now defunct), FIFA Club World Cup or UEFA Super Cup are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.[221]\\r\\n\\r\\nManchester United formed a women's football team in 2018.[222][223][224][225][226]","input":"When did manchester united last won premier league?"},{"output":"2630 BCÿ2611 BC","context":"\\r\\nThe Egyptian pyramids are ancient pyramid-shaped masonry structures located in Egypt.\\r\\nAs of November 2008, sources cite either 118 or 138 as the number of identified Egyptian pyramids.[1][2] Most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.[3][4][5]\\r\\nThe earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis. The earliest among these is the Pyramid of Djoser (constructed 2630 BCÿ2611 BC) which was built during the third dynasty. This pyramid and its surrounding complex were designed by the architect Imhotep, and are generally considered to be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry.[6]\\r\\nThe most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built.[7] The Pyramid of Khufu at Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time of the Early Dynastic Period, those with sufficient means were buried in bench-like structures known as mastabas.[8][9]\\r\\nThe second historically-documented Egyptian pyramid is attributed to the architect Imhotep, who planned what Egyptologists believe to be a tomb for the pharaoh Djoser. Imhotep is credited with being the first to conceive the notion of stacking mastabas on top of each other, creating an edifice composed of a number of \\"steps\\" that decreased in size towards its apex. The result was the Pyramid of Djoser, which was designed to serve as a gigantic stairway by which the soul of the deceased pharaoh could ascend to the heavens. Such was the importance of Imhotep's achievement that he was deified by later Egyptians.[10]\\r\\nThe most prolific pyramid-building phase coincided with the greatest degree of absolutist rule. It was during this time that the most famous pyramids, the Giza pyramid complex, were built. Over time, as authority became less centralized, the ability and willingness to harness the resources required for construction on a massive scale decreased, and later pyramids were smaller, less well-built and often hastily constructed.\\r\\nLong after the end of Egypt's own pyramid-building period, a burst of pyramid-building occurred in what is present-day Sudan, after much of Egypt came under the rule of the kings of Napata. While Napatan rule was brief, ending in 661 BC, Egyptian culture made an indelible impression, and during the later Kingdom of Mero? (approximately in the period between 300 BCE ÿ 300 CE), this flowered into a full-blown pyramid-building revival, which saw more than two hundred Egyptian-inspired indigenous royal pyramid-tombs constructed in the vicinity of the kingdom's capital cities.\\r\\nAl-Aziz Uthman (1171ÿ1198) tried to destroy the Giza pyramid complex. He gave up after damaging the Pyramid of Menkaure because the task proved too huge.[11]\\r\\nThe shape of Egyptian pyramids is thought to represent the primordial mound from which the Egyptians believed the earth was created. The shape of a pyramid is thought to be representative of the descending rays of the sun, and most pyramids were faced with polished, highly reflective white limestone, in order to give them a brilliant appearance when viewed from a distance. Pyramids were often also named in ways that referred to solar luminescence. For example, the formal name of the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur was The Southern Shining Pyramid, and that of Senwosret at el-Lahun was Senwosret is Shining.\\r\\nWhile it is generally agreed that pyramids were burial monuments, there is continued disagreement on the particular theological principles that might have given rise to them. One suggestion is that they were designed as a type of \\"resurrection machine.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe Egyptians believed the dark area of the night sky around which the stars appear to revolve was the physical gateway into the heavens. One of the narrow shafts that extend from the main burial chamber through the entire body of the Great Pyramid points directly towards the center of this part of the sky. This suggests the pyramid may have been designed to serve as a means to magically launch the deceased pharaoh's soul directly into the abode of the gods.[12]\\r\\nAll Egyptian pyramids were built on the west bank of the Nile, which, as the site of the setting sun, was associated with the realm of the dead in Egyptian mythology.[13]\\r\\nIn 1842, Karl Richard Lepsius produced the first modern list of pyramids ÿ see Lepsius list of pyramids ÿ in which he counted 67. A great many more have since been discovered. As of November 2008, 118 Egyptian pyramids have been identified.[3]\\r\\nThe location of Pyramid 29, which Lepsius called the \\"Headless Pyramid\\", was lost for a second time when the structure was buried by desert sands subsequent to Lepsius' survey. It was found again only during an archaeological dig conducted in 2008.[14]\\r\\nMany pyramids are in a poor state of preservation or buried by desert sands. If visible at all, they may appear as little more than mounds of rubble. As a consequence, archaeologists are continuing to identify and study previously unknown pyramid structures.\\r\\nThe most recent pyramid to be discovered was that of Sesheshet at Saqqara, mother of the Sixth Dynasty pharaoh Teti. The discovery was announced by Zahi Hawass, Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, on 11 November 2008.[4][15]\\r\\nAll of Egypt's pyramids, except the small Third Dynasty pyramid of Zawyet el-Amwat (or Zawyet el-Mayitin), are sited on the west bank of the Nile, and most are grouped together in a number of pyramid fields. The most important of these are listed geographically, from north to south, below.\\r\\nAbu Rawash is the site of Egypt's most northerly pyramid (other than the ruins of Lepsius pyramid number one)[5] the mostly ruined Pyramid of Djedefre, son and successor of Khufu. Originally it was thought that this pyramid had never been completed, but the current archaeological consensus is that not only was it completed, but that it was originally about the same size as the Pyramid of Menkaure, which would have placed it among the half-dozen or so largest pyramids in Egypt.\\r\\nIts location adjacent to a major crossroads made it an easy source of stone. Quarrying ÿ which began in Roman times ÿ has left little apart from about 15 courses of stone superimposed upon the natural hillock that formed part of the pyramid's core. A small adjacent satellite pyramid is in a better state of preservation.\\r\\nGiza is the location of the Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the \\"Great Pyramid\\" and the \\"Pyramid of Cheops\\"); the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Kephren); the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices known as \\"Queen's pyramids\\"; and the Great Sphinx of Giza.\\r\\nOf the three, only Khafre's pyramid retains part of its original polished limestone casing, near its apex. This pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction ÿ it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume.\\r\\nThe Giza pyramid complex has been a popular tourist destination since antiquity, and was popularized in Hellenistic times when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Today it is the only one of those wonders still in existence.\\r\\nThis site, halfway between Giza and Abu Sir, is the location for two unfinished Old Kingdom pyramids. The northern structure's owner is believed to be pharaoh Nebka, while the southern structure, known as the Layer Pyramid, may be attributable to the Third Dynasty pharaoh Khaba, a close successor of Sekhemkhet. If this attribution is correct, Khaba's short reign could explain the seemingly unfinished state of this step pyramid. Today it stands around 17?m (56?ft) high; had it been completed, it is likely to have exceeded 40?m (130?ft).\\r\\nThere are a total of fourteen pyramids at this site, which served as the main royal necropolis during the Fifth Dynasty. The quality of construction of the Abu Sir pyramids is inferior to those of the Fourth Dynasty ÿ perhaps signaling a decrease in royal power or a less vibrant economy. They are smaller than their predecessors, and are built of low-quality local limestone.\\r\\nThe three major pyramids are those of Niuserre, which is also the best preserved, Neferirkare Kakai and Sahure. The site is also home to the incomplete Pyramid of Neferefre. Most of the major pyramids at Abu Sir were built similar construction techniques, comprising a rubble core surrounded by steps of mud bricks with a limestone outer casing. The largest of these 5th-Dynasty pyramids, the Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai, is believed to have been built originally as a step pyramid some 70?m (230?ft) high and then later transformed into a \\"true\\" pyramid by having its steps filled in with loose masonry.\\r\\nMajor pyramids located here include the Pyramid of Djoser ÿ generally identified as the world's oldest substantial monumental structure to be built of dressed stone ÿ the Pyramid of Userkaf, the Pyramid of Teti and the Pyramid of Merikare, dating to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt. Also at Saqqara is the Pyramid of Unas, which retains a pyramid causeway that is one of the best-preserved in Egypt. Together with the pyramid of Userkaf, this pyramid was the subject of one of the earliest known restoration attempts, conducted by Khaemweset, a son of Ramesses II.[16] Saqqara is also the location of the incomplete step pyramid of Djoser's successor Sekhemkhet known as the Buried Pyramid. Archaeologists believe that had this pyramid been completed, it would have been larger than Djoser's.\\r\\nSouth of the main pyramid field at Saqqara is a second collection of later, smaller pyramids, including those of Pepi I, Isesi, Merenre, Pepi II and Ibi. Most of these are in a poor state of preservation.\\r\\nThe Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Shepseskaf either did not share an interest in, or have the capacity to undertake pyramid construction like his predecessors. His tomb, which is also sited at south Saqqara, was instead built as an unusually large mastaba and offering temple complex. It is commonly known as the Mastabat al-Firaun.[17]\\r\\nA previously unknown pyramid was discovered at north Saqqara in late 2008. Believed to be the tomb of Teti's mother, it currently stands approximately 5?m (16?ft) high, although the original height was closer to 14?m (46?ft).\\r\\nThis area is arguably the most important pyramid field in Egypt outside Giza and Saqqara, although until 1996 the site was inaccessible due to its location within a military base, and was relatively unknown outside archaeological circles.\\r\\nThe southern Pyramid of Sneferu, commonly known as the Bent Pyramid, is believed to be the first Egyptian pyramid intended by its builders to be a \\"true\\" smooth-sided pyramid from the outset; the earlier pyramid at Meidum had smooth sides in its finished state ÿ but it was conceived and built as a step pyramid, before having its steps filled in and concealed beneath a smooth outer casing of dressed stone.\\r\\nAs a true smooth-sided structure, the Bent Pyramid was only a partial success ÿ albeit a unique, visually imposing one; it is also the only major Egyptian pyramid to retain a significant proportion of its original smooth outer limestone casing intact. As such it serves as the best contemporary example of how the ancient Egyptians intended their pyramids to look.\\r\\nSeveral kilometeres to the north of the Bent Pyramid is the last ÿ and most successful ÿ of the three pyramids constructed during the reign of Sneferu; the Red Pyramid is the world's first successfully completed smooth-sided pyramid. The structure is also the third largest pyramid in Egypt ÿ after the pyramids of Khufu and Khafra at Giza.\\r\\nAlso at Dahshur is the pyramid known as the Pyramid of Amenemhat III, as well as a number of small, mostly ruined subsidiary pyramids.\\r\\nLocated to the south of Dahshur, several mudbrick pyramids were built in this area in the late Middle Kingdom, perhaps for Amenemhat IV and Sobekneferu.\\r\\nTwo major pyramids are known to have been built at Lisht ÿ those of Amenemhat I and his son, Senusret I. The latter is surrounded by the ruins of ten smaller subsidiary pyramids. One of these subsidiary pyramids is known to be that of Amenemhat's cousin, Khaba II.[18] The site which is in the vicinity of the oasis of the Faiyum, midway between Dahshur and Meidum, and about 100 kilometres south of Cairo, is believed to be in the vicinity of the ancient city of Itjtawy (the precise location of which remains unknown), which served as the capital of Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty.\\r\\nThe pyramid at Meidum is one of three constructed during the reign of Sneferu, and is believed by some to have been started by that pharaoh's father and predecessor, Huni. However, that attribution is uncertain, as no record of Huni's name has been found at the site.\\r\\nIt was constructed as a step pyramid, and then later converted into the first \\"true\\" smooth-sided pyramid when the steps were filled in, and an outer casing added.\\r\\nThe pyramid suffered several catastrophic collapses in ancient and medieval times; medieval Arab writers described it as having seven steps ÿ although today only the three uppermost of these remain, giving the structure its odd, tower-like appearance. The hill on which the pyramid is situated is not a natural landscape feature ÿ it is the small mountain of debris created when the lower courses and outer casing of the pyramid gave way.\\r\\nAmenemhat III was the last powerful ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty, and the pyramid he built at Hawarra, near the Faiyum, is believed to post-date the so-called \\"Black Pyramid\\" built by the same ruler at Dahshur. It is the Hawarra pyramid that is believed to have been Amenemhet's final resting place.\\r\\nThe pyramid of Senusret II at el-Lahun is the southernmost royal-tomb pyramid structure in Egypt. Its builders reduced the amount of work necessary to construct it by ingeniously using as its foundation and core a 12-meter-high natural limestone hill.\\r\\nPiye, the first ruler of the Egyptian 25th dynasty, built a pyramid at El-Kurru. He was the first Egyptian pharaoh to be buried in a pyramid in centuries.\\r\\nTaharqa, a legitimate ruler and Pharaoh of Egypt, built his pyramid at Nuri. It was the largest in the area (North Sudan).\\r\\nThe following table lays out the chronology of the construction of most of the major pyramids mentioned here. Each pyramid is identified through the pharaoh who ordered it built, his approximate reign, and its location.\\r\\nConstructing the pyramids involved moving huge quantities of stone. The quarried blocks were likely transported to the construction site by wooden sleds, with sand in front of the sled wetted to reduce friction. Droplets of water created bridges between the grains of sand, helping them stick together.[20]\\r\\nList\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 295834N 310752E? / ?29.97611N 31.13111E? / 29.97611; 31.13111","input":"When was first pyramid built in ancient egypt?"},{"output":"Springfield, Missouri","context":"BPS Direct LLC (doing business as Bass Pro Shops) is an American privately-held retailer of hunting, fishing, camping and related outdoor recreation merchandise, known for stocking a wide selection of gear. Bass Pro Shops supports and sells merchandise for the National Audubon Society.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority owner, John Morris, began his career in sporting goods with a fishing section in the back of a Brown Derby liquor store owned by his father, located in Springfield MO on the road to Table Rock Lake and Branson, Missouri. That small fishing department sold homemade bait and worms, proving popular enough that Bass Pro Shops was incorporated in 1971. These homemade baits were so popular that many people wanted the opportunity to buy these when they had returned home. Thus began the Bass Pro Shops catalog, first mailed in 1974. Soon, it became the world's largest mail order sporting goods store.\\r\\nIn 1975, to meet the burgeoning demand for Bass Pro Shops exclusive products, American Rod and Gun was established. Acting as a separate wholesaling entity ARG serves more than 7,000 independently owned retail stores worldwide. In 1977, Bass Pro Shops introduced the first fish-ready complete boat motor and trailer package with the Bass Tracker. In 1984, construction began on the Outdoor World Catalog Showroom in Springfield, Missouri. Big Cedar Lodge opened in 1988 on Table Rock Lake.\\r\\nIn 1995, Bass Pro Shops Sportsman's Warehouse opened in Atlanta, Georgia, its first store outside the state of Missouri. In November 2001, taking advantage of Outdoor World's popularity as a tourist destination, the Wonders of Wildlife museum was opened next door to the store in Springfield.[2][3] The Wonders of Wildlife Museum & Aquarium closed for renovation in 2007. As of October 2016 it is still closed with an expected reopening by the end of the year. Bass Pro Shops has announced that the grand reopening of the Wonders of Wildlife museum will take place on September 21st, 2017. [4]\\r\\nIn 2015, Bass Pro Shops opened a store inside the Memphis Pyramid, a former sports arena and concert venue in Memphis, Tennessee. In addition to the retail store itself, the building houses two restaurants, a bowling alley, a 100-room hotel, an observation deck, and the tallest free-standing elevator in America. At 535,000 sq ft, The Pyramid is Bass Pro's largest store.\\r\\nIn October 2016, Bass Pro Shops announced that they had reached a deal to acquire competitor Cabela's for $5.5 billion. The deal is being financed via preferred equity financing from Goldman Sachs and Pamplona. Goldman Sachs will contribute $1.8 billion towards financing and Pamplona will contribute the remainder for a total commitment of $2.4 billion.[13] The new entity is expected to be formed and in operation in Q1 or Q2 of 2017.[5] The new entity will keep Cabelas base in Sidney and Lincoln, Nebraska. Morris will continue as CEO of the new entity. He will also be the majority shareholder of the new privately held entity. Tommy Milner stressed that the company had reviewed a range of options that would maximize value, with the board choosing to go the route of Bass Pro Shops.\\r\\nBass Pro Shops carries a number of house brands. Among these are:\\r\\nFor the article on the company, see Tracker Marine Group.\\r\\nIn 1978, Bass Pro Shops introduced the Bass Tracker boat, produced by the Tracker Marine Group. Its brands include Tracker Boats, Nitro, Sun Tracker, Tahoe, Fisher, ProCraft, Kenner, Mako Myacht and SeaCraft. These boats are sold in showrooms attached to every Bass Pro Shops store, in stand alone Tracker dealerships, and to independent marine dealers throughout the United States. All Tracker Marine Group boats are manufactured in multiple plants in southern Missouri. Over 400,000 people have purchased Tracker boats since 1978.[2]\\r\\nBass Pro Shops has 94 existing stores in the United States and Canada. The store sizes range from 20,000 square feet (1,900?m2) up to 535,000 square feet (49,700?m2). The largest flagship stores are known as Outdoor World stores. The decor of the stores includes taxidermy mounts native to the local area. All stores have an indoor water feature that showcases fish species that are indigenous to the area. The fish in their tanks are game fish of great size. In some of these aquariums, professional anglers and store pro-staff hold demonstrations showing the use of an artificial bait. They catch the fish in these tanks to show how well the bait works. Bass Pro Shops is also known for its Outdoor Skills Workshops, teaching skills as varied as fly fishing, Dutch oven cooking, archery hunting with an archery range in the store, and GPS navigation. They hold many skills workshops with the top names in the outdoor world.[2]\\r\\nThe Rancho Cucamonga, California Outdoor World store is used for the exterior shots of the fictional \\"Outdoor Man\\" store in the ABC sitcom Last Man Standing, starring Tim Allen, that premiered in 2011. Camera crews have also visited the store several times to film interior shots.[6]\\r\\nBass Pro Shops have several other stores that do not fall under the Outdoor World flagship brand.\\r\\nPrior to the Cabela's acquisition, Bass Pro Shops had several stores under construction.

It showcases almost 1,000 sporting artifacts from the 1600s to today, including some historically significant firearms from the NRA Museum Collection. The museum will host firearms and artwork from the Remington Arms Company factory collection, a multimillion-dollar collection of U.S. military sidearms, engraved Colt revolvers of the American frontier, the guns of Annie Oakley and firearms of U.S. Presidents like Teddy Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower.[98]\\r\\nBass Pro Shops and its owner, John Morris, have had a longtime interest in NASCAR racing. The company has sponsored such racers as Dale Earnhardt, Kerry Earnhardt, and Martin Truex Jr. Truex won the 2004 and 2005 Busch Series championships in the No. 8 Bass Pro Shops-sponsored Chevy, and drove the No. 1 Chevy for Earnhardt Ganassi Racing in the Sprint Cup series from 2005 to 2009. He got his first win at Dover International Speedway and finished 11th in the Chase for the Nextel Cup in 2007. While Truex, Jr. renewed with Bass Pro Shops as his main sponsor for three years in 2007. In 2009, he announced he would be leaving Earnhardt Ganassi Racing for Michael Waltrip Racing in 2010. Jamie McMurray, former driver of the Roush Fenway Racing Crown Royal Ford Fusion and who is from Joplin, MO (approx. 60 miles away from the national headquarters in Springfield), replaced Truex, Jr. for the 2010 season.\\r\\nMcMurray won the 2010 Daytona 500 in his first race driving in the Bass Pro Shops-sponsored Chevrolet.

It is positioned on the right of the Canadian political spectrum.[12] The party's leader is Andrew Scheer, who serves as Leader of the Official Opposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conservative Party is the successor to multiple right-wing parties which have existed in Canada for over a century.[13] Until 1942, one of the party's predecessors was known as the Conservative Party of Canada and participated in numerous governments.[14] Before 1942, the predecessors to the Conservatives had multiple names, but by 1942, the main right-wing Canadian force became known as the Progressive Conservatives.[15] In 1957, John Diefenbaker became the first Prime Minister from the Progressive Conservative Party, and remained in office until 1963.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Progressive Conservative government was elected after the results of the 1979 federal election, with Joe Clark becoming Prime Minister. Clark served from 1979 to 1980, when he was defeated by the Liberal Party after the 1980 federal election.[17] In 1984, the Progressive Conservatives won with Brian Mulroney becoming Prime Minister.[18] Mulroney was Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993, and his government was marked by free trade agreements and economic liberalization.[19] The party suffered a near complete loss after the 1993 federal election, thanks to a splintering of the right-wing; the Conservatives' other predecessor, the Reform Party, led by Preston Manning placed in third, leaving the Progressive Conservatives in fifth. A similar result occurred in 1997, and in 2000, when the Reform Party became the Canadian Alliance.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged, forming the Conservative Party of Canada.[13] The unified Conservative Party generally favours lower taxes, small government, more decentralization of federal government powers to the provinces modeled after the Meech Lake Accord and a tougher stand on \\"law and order\\" issues. The party won two minority governments after the 2006 federal election, and a majority government in the 2011 federal election before being defeated in the 2015 federal election by a majority Liberal government.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Lynch-Staunton served as interim leader of the newly created Conservative Party of Canada from 8 December 2003 until 20 March 2004, when the party elected Stephen Harper as its first leader. Andrew Scheer was elected leader on 27 May 2017.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Deputy Leader is appointed by the Leader. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Council is the party's national governing body that is elected by the Conservative Party membership at its bi-annual meetings. A National Councillor is elected for a two-year term and cannot serve for more than three consecutive terms.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nComposition of the National Council is based on the following criteria:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present, the National Council has four members from Ontario; two each from Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec; one each from the remaining provinces and territories for a total of 19 members,[23] plus the party leader and the two non-voting members for a total 22 members.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party president is elected by National Council following their election. Since 2016, the President of the Conservative Party has been Scott Lamb, a councillor representing British Columbia. The party President is the conduit between the Party Leader and the National Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Executive Director answers to the party President, and is responsible for the day-to-day management and operations of the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom February 2009 to December 2013, the Executive Director was Dan Hilton.\\r\\n\\r\\nDimitri Soudas was named the new Executive Director in December 2013.[25] On 30 March 2014, Soudas was told to resign or be fired from the position after allegedly interfering with the nomination contest taking place in his fiancee's riding.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2014, Dustin Van Vugt was brought in as the Deputy Executive Director?ÿ a position created specifically for him.[27] Some media agencies, such as the CBC, suggested that this was a way for Thompson to begin handing over the work for the top job to Van Vugt, until his promotion to Executive Director could be formally ratified by the party's National Council. In October 2014, Van Vugt's position was unanimously ratified by the party's National Council, and Thompson became the Chief Operations Officer.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Director of Political Operations reports to the Executive Director, and is one of the most important positions within the party. The person filling this role often has direct access to the party leader, due to their responsibilities for organizing the party's work on the ground and in preparing for the next election. With Stephen Harper as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader, the Director of Political Operations has frequently moved from party positions to the Prime Minister's and other Minister's Offices, and then back to the party's headquarters, depending on the identified needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoug Finley was the Director of Political Operations until 2009, when Finley was appointed to the Senate and Jenni Byrne, then Finley's Deputy, became the Director.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2013, Byrne left the job to become the co-Deputy Chief of Staff in the Prime Minister's Office. Fred DeLorey, then the party's Director of Communications, became the Director.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conservative Party's senate caucus continues to be formally affiliated to the party. Unlike the Senate Liberal Caucus and the non-partisan Independent Senators Group which are unaffiliated with parties in the House of Commons,  Conservative senators are also part of the national Conservative parliamentary caucus made up of members of both houses of parliament, though the senators also meets separately to discuss Senate-specific issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe caucus was created following the establishment of the modern Conservative Party of Canada on February 2, 2004 as a result of the merger of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. All but three Progressive Conservative Senators joined the Conservative Party and were redesignated as Conservative senators.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in government, the leader of the caucus has been appointed by the national Conservative Party leader, serving as Prime Minister of Canada. When in Opposition the leader is elected by Conservative senators. Most recently, Larry Smith was elected Senate Conservative leader on March 28, 2017, defeating two other candidates.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first leader of the senate caucus, John Lynch-Staunton, also served as interim leader of the Conservative Party of Canada until a leadership election could be held.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conservative Party is governed by a constitution.[30] The constitution may be amended through the same procedure as outlined for \\"Policy Development\\" below.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"founding principles\\" of the Conservative Party appear in both the constitution and the policy declaration. They are the reasons that the Conservative Party was formed, and thus the only part of the constitution and policy declaration not up for possible amendment at a national convention.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policy declaration of the Conservative Party is a statement of which policies the Conservative Party membership would like its Leader to implement if and when they form government.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicies are directly decided by members attending a bi-annual national convention. The rules governing the passage of those policies are formally ratified by the National Council, and clarify rules such as speaking slots and voting requirements.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicy proposals start with local riding associations, who form policy committees to discuss ideas. The riding association then puts their policies forward for discussion at a regional meeting, where they are discussed amongst a larger group of regionally based members. They are then submitted for discussion at a provincial meeting, where they are further discussed. The provincial meetings are the last level of discussions before they are placed on the agenda for the national convention's agenda.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the national convention, \\"breakout\\" discussion tables are formed. For example, a table may discuss several policies related to \\"foreign affairs\\" or \\"health care\\" policies. The individuals attending those breakout tables then return to their riding association delegates and encourage them to vote for the motion(s) discussed at the breakout table. During voting, individuals show their support or opposition to a proposal. If a majority agrees with the proposal, it is added to the policy declaration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conservative Party's policy declaration is divided into 23 pronouncements on policy:[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conservative Party is political heir to a series of right-of-centre parties that have existed in Canada, beginning with the Liberal-Conservative Party founded in 1854 by Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir George-tienne Cartier. The party later became known simply as the Conservative Party after 1873. Like its historical predecessors and conservative parties in some other Commonwealth nations (such as the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom), members of the present-day Conservative Party of Canada are sometimes referred to as \\"Tories\\". The modern Conservative Party of Canada is also legal heir to the heritage of the historical conservative parties by virtue of assuming the assets and liabilities of the former Progressive Conservative Party upon the merger of 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first incarnations of the Conservative Party in Canada were quite different from the Conservative Party of today, especially on economic issues. The early Conservatives were known to espouse economic protectionism and British imperialism, by emphasizing Canada's ties to the United Kingdom while vigorously opposing free trade with the United States; free trade being a policy which, at the time, had strong support from the ranks of the Liberal Party of Canada.[33] The Conservatives also sparred with the Liberal Party because of its connections with French Canadian nationalists including Henri Bourassa who wanted Canada to distance itself from Britain, and demanded that Canada recognize that it had two nations, English Canada and French Canada, connected together through a common history. The Conservatives would go on with a popular slogan \\"one nation, one flag, one leader\\".[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conservative Party's popular support waned (particularly in western Canada) during difficult economic times from the 1920s to 1940s, as it was seen by many in the west as an eastern establishment party which ignored the needs of the citizens of Western Canada. Westerners of multiple political convictions including small-\\"c\\" conservatives saw the party as being uninterested in the economically unstable Prairie regions of the west at the time and instead holding close ties with the business elite of Ontario and Quebec. As a result of western alienation both the dominant Conservative and Liberal parties were challenged in the west by the rise of a number of protest parties including the Progressive Party of Canada, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), the Reconstruction Party of Canada and the Social Credit Party of Canada. In 1921, the Conservatives were reduced to third place in number of seats in the House of Common behind the Progressives, though soon after, the Progressive Party folded. The Premier of Manitoba and leader of the Progressive Party of Manitoba, John Bracken became leader of the Conservative Party in 1942 subject to several conditions, one of which was that the party be renamed the Progressive Conservative Party.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, many former supporters of the Progressive Conservative Party shifted their support to either the federal CCF or to the federal Liberals. The advancement of the provincially popular western-based conservative Social Credit Party in federal politics was stalled, in part by the strategic selection of leaders from the west by the Progressive Conservative Party. PC leaders such as John Diefenbaker and Joe Clark were seen by many westerners as viable challengers to the Liberals who traditionally had relied on the electorate in Quebec and Ontario for their power base. While none of the various protest parties ever succeeded in gaining significant power federally, they were damaging to the Progressive Conservative Party throughout its history, and allowed the federal Liberals to win election after election with strong urban support bases in Ontario and Quebec. This historical tendency earned the Liberals the unofficial title often given by some political pundits of being Canada's \\"natural governing party\\". Prior to 1984, Canada was seen as having a dominant-party system led by the Liberal Party while Progressive Conservative governments therefore were considered by many of these pundits as caretaker governments, doomed to fall once the collective mood of the electorate shifted and the federal Liberal Party eventually came back to power.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, the Progressive Conservative Party's electoral fortunes made a massive upturn under its new leader, Brian Mulroney, an anglophone Quebecer and former president of the Iron Ore Company of Canada, who mustered a large coalition of westerners, aggravated over the National Energy Program of the Liberal government, suburban and small-town Ontarians, and soft Quebec nationalists, who were angered over Quebec not having distinct status in the Constitution of Canada signed in 1982.[34][35] This led to a huge landslide victory for the Progressive Conservative Party. Progressive Conservatives abandoned protectionism which the party had held strongly to in the past and which had aggravated westerners and businesses and fully espoused free trade with the United States and integrating Canada into a globalized economy. This was accomplished with the signing of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1989 and much of the key implementation process of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which added Mexico to the Canada-U.S. free trade zone.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, federal conservative politics became split by the creation of a new western-based protest party, the populist and social conservative Reform Party of Canada created by Preston Manning, son of Alberta Social Credit Premier Ernest Manning. It advocated deep decentralization of government power, abolition of official bilingualism and multiculturalism, democratization of the Senate of Canada, and suggested a potential return to capital punishment, and advocated significant privatization of public services.[citation needed] Westerners reportedly felt betrayed by the federal Progressive Conservative Party (PC), seeing it as catering to Quebec and urban Ontario interests over theirs. In 1989, Reform made headlines in the political scene when its first MP, Deborah Grey, was elected in a by-election in Alberta, which was a shock to the PCs which had almost complete electoral dominance over the province for years. Another defining event for western conservatives was when Mulroney accepted the results of an unofficial Senate \\"election\\" held in Alberta, which resulted in the appointment of a Reformer, Stanley Waters, to the Senate.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1990s, Mulroney had failed to bring about Senate reform as he had promised (appointing a number of Senators in 1990). As well, social conservatives were dissatisfied with Mulroney's social progressivism. Canadians in general were furious with high unemployment, high debt and deficit, unpopular implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 1991, and the failed constitutional reforms of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords. In 1993, support for the Progressive Conservative Party collapsed, and the party's representation in the House of Commons dropped from an absolute majority of seats to only two seats. The 1993 results were the worst electoral disaster in Canadian history, and the Progressive Conservatives never fully recovered.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, federal politics became divided regionally. The Liberal Party took Ontario, the Maritimes and the territories, the separatist Bloc Qubcois took Quebec, while the Reform Party took Western Canada and became the dominant conservative party in Canada. The problem of the split on the right was accentuated by Canada's single member plurality electoral system, which resulted in numerous seats being won by the Liberal Party, even when the total number of votes cast for PC and Reform Party candidates was substantially in excess of the total number of votes cast for the Liberal candidate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, the Canadian Alliance (formerly the Reform Party) and Progressive Conservative parties agreed to merge into the present-day Conservative Party, with the Alliance faction conceding its populist ideals and some social conservative elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15 October 2003, after closed-door meetings were held by the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservative Party, Stephen Harper (then the leader of the Canadian Alliance) and Peter MacKay (then the leader of the Progressive Conservatives) announced the \\"'Conservative Party Agreement-in-Principle\\", thereby merging their parties to create the new Conservative Party of Canada. After several months of talks between two teams of \\"emissaries\\", consisting of Don Mazankowski, Bill Davis and Loyola Hearn on behalf of the PCs and Ray Speaker Senator Gerry St. Germain and Scott Reid on behalf of the Alliance, the deal came to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 December 2003 the Agreement-in-Principle was ratified by the membership of the Alliance by a margin of 96% to 4% in a national referendum conducted by postal ballot. On 6 December, the PC Party held a series of regional conventions, at which delegates ratified the Agreement-in-Principle by a margin of 90% to 10%. On 7 December, the new party was officially registered with Elections Canada. On 20 March 2004 Harper was elected leader.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe merger process was opposed by some elements in both parties. In the PCs in particular, the merger process resulted in organized opposition, and in a substantial number of prominent members refusing to join the new party. The opponents of the merger were not internally united as a single internal opposition movement, and they did not announce their opposition at the same moment. David Orchard argued that his written agreement with Peter MacKay, which had been signed a few months earlier at the 2003 Progressive Conservative Leadership convention, excluded any such merger. Orchard announced his opposition to the merger before negotiations with the Canadian Alliance had been completed. The basis of Orchard's crucial support for MacKay's leadership bid was MacKay's promise in writing to Orchard not merge the Alliance and PC parties. MacKay was roundly criticized for openly lying about an existential question for the PC party. Over the course of the following year, Orchard led an unsuccessful legal challenge to the merger of the two parties. MacKay's promise to not merge the Alliance and PC's was not enforceable in court, though it would have if one dollar exchanged hands as payment for consideration.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October and November, during the course of the PC party's process of ratifying the merger, four sitting Progressive Conservative MPs  Andr Bachand, John Herron, former Tory leadership candidate Scott Brison, and former Prime Minister Joe Clark  announced their intention not to join the new Conservative Party caucus, as did retiring PC Party president Bruck Easton. Clark and Brison argued that the party's merger with the Canadian Alliance drove it too far to the right, and away from its historical position in Canadian politics.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 January 2004 former Alliance leadership candidate Keith Martin, left the party, and sat temporarily as an independent. He was reelected, running as a Liberal, in the 2004 election, and again in 2006 and 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early months following the merger, MP Rick Borotsik, who had been elected as Manitoba's only PC, became openly critical of the new party's leadership. Borotsik chose not to run in the 2004 general election. Brison, at first, voted for and supported the ratification of the Alliance-PC merger, then crossed the floor to the Liberals.[36] Soon afterward, he was made a parliamentary secretary in Paul Martin's Liberal government. Herron also ran as a Liberal candidate in the election, but did not join the Liberal caucus prior to the election. He lost his seat to the new Conservative Party's candidate Rob Moore. Bachand and Clark sat as independent Progressive Conservatives until an election was called in the spring of 2004, and then retired from Parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree senators, William Doody, Norman Atkins, and Lowell Murray, declined to join the new party and continued to sit in the upper house as a rump caucus of Progressive Conservatives. In February 2005, Liberals appointed two anti-merger Progressive Conservatives, Nancy Ruth and Elaine McCoy, to the Senate. In March 2006, Ruth joined the new Conservative Party.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, following the 2004 federal election, Conservative Senator Jean-Claude Rivest left the party to sit as an independent (choosing not to join Senators Doody, Atkins and Murray in their rump Progressive Conservative caucus). Senator Rivest cited, as his reason for this action, his concern that the new party was too right-wing and that it was insensitive to the needs and interests of Quebec.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the immediate aftermath of the merger announcement, some Conservative activists hoped to recruit former Ontario Premier Mike Harris for the leadership. Harris declined the invitation, as did New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord and Alberta Premier Ralph Klein. Outgoing Progressive Conservative leader Peter MacKay also announced he would not seek the leadership, as did former Democratic Representative Caucus leader Chuck Strahl. Jim Prentice, who had been a candidate in the 2003 PC leadership contest, entered the Conservative leadership race in mid-December but dropped out in mid-January because of an inability to raise funds so soon after his earlier leadership bid.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, there were three candidates in the partys first leadership election: former Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper, former Magna International CEO Belinda Stronach, and former Ontario provincial PC Cabinet minister Tony Clement. Voting took place on 20 March 2004. A total of 97,397 ballots were cast.[37] Harper won on the first ballot with a commanding 68.9% of the vote (67,143 votes). Stronach received 22.9% (22,286 votes), and Clement received 8.2% (7,968 votes).[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vote was conducted using a weighted voting system in which all of Canadas 308 ridings were given 100 points, regardless of the number of votes cast by party members in that riding (for a total of 30,800 points, with 15,401 points required to win). Each candidate would be awarded a number of points equivalent to the percentage of the votes they had won in that riding. For example, a candidate winning 50 votes in a riding in which the total number of votes cast was 100 would receive 50 points. A candidate would also receive 50 points for winning 500 votes in a riding where 1,000 votes were cast. In practice, there were wide differences in the number of votes cast in each riding across the country. More than 1,000 voters participated in each of the fifteen ridings with the highest voter turnout. By contrast, only eight votes were cast in each of the two ridings with the lowest levels of participation.)[39] As a result, individual votes in the ridings where the greatest numbers of votes were cast were worth less than one percent as much as votes from the ridings where the fewest votes were cast.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe equal-weighting system gave Stronach a substantial advantage, because her support was strongest in the parts of the country where the party had the fewest members, while Harper tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in ridings with larger membership numbers. Thus, the official count, which was based on points rather than on votes, gave her a much better result. Of 30,800 available points, Harper won 17,296, or 56.2%. Stronach won 10,613 points, or 34.5%. Clement won 2,887 points, or 9.4%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actual vote totals remained confidential when the leadership election results were announced; only the point totals were made public at the time, giving the impression of a race that was much closer than was actually the case. Three years later, Harpers former campaign manager, Tom Flanagan, published the actual vote totals, noting that, among other distortions caused by the equal-weighting system, \\"a vote cast in Quebec was worth 19.6 times as much as a vote cast in Alberta\\".[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo months after Harper's election as national Tory leader, Liberal Party of Canada leader and Prime Minister Paul Martin called a general election for 28 June 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time since the 1993 federal election, a Liberal government would have to deal with an opposition party that was generally seen as being able to form government. The Liberals attempted to counter this with an early election call, as this would give the Conservatives less time to consolidate their merger. During the first half of the campaign, polls showed a rise in support for the new party, leading some pollsters to predict the election of a minority Conservative government. An unpopular provincial budget by Ontario Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty hurt the federal Liberals in Ontario. The Liberals managed to narrow the gap and eventually regain momentum by targeting the Conservatives' credibility and motives, hurting their efforts to present a reasonable, responsible and moderate alternative to the governing Liberals.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral controversial comments were made by Conservative MPs during the campaign. Early on in the campaign, Ontario MP Scott Reid indicated his feelings as Tory language critic that the policy of official bilingualism was unrealistic and needed to be reformed. Alberta MP Rob Merrifield suggested as Tory health critic that women ought to have mandatory family counseling before they choose to have an abortion. BC MP Randy White indicated his willingness near the end of the campaign to use the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian Constitution to override the Charter of Rights on the issue of same-sex marriage, and Cheryl Gallant, another Ontario MP, compared abortion to terrorism. The party was also criticized for issuing (quickly retracted) press releases accusing both Paul Martin and Jack Layton of supporting child pornography.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarper's new Conservatives emerged from the election with a larger parliamentary caucus of 99 MPs while the Liberals were reduced to a minority government of 135 MPs, twenty short of a majority.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, some political analysts such as former Progressive Conservative pollster Allan Gregg and Toronto Star columnist Chantal Hbert suggested that the then-subsequent election could result in a Conservative government if the public were to perceive the Tories as emerging from the party's founding convention (then scheduled for March 2005 in Montreal) with clearly defined, moderate policies with which to challenge the Liberals. The convention provided the public with an opportunity to see the Conservative Party in a new light, appearing to have reduced the focus on its controversial social conservative agenda. It retained its populist appeal by espousing tax cuts, smaller government, and more decentralization by giving the provinces more taxing powers and decision-making authority in joint federal-provincial programs. The party's law and order package was an effort to address rising homicide rates, which had gone up 12% in 2004.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 May 2005 MP Belinda Stronach unexpectedly crossed the floor from the Conservative Party to join the Liberal Party. In late August and early September 2005, the Tories released ads through Ontario's major television broadcasters that highlighted their policies towards health care, education and child support. The ads each featured Stephen Harper discussing policy with prominent members of his Shadow Cabinet. Some analysts suggested at the time that the Tories would use similar ads in the expected 2006 federal election, instead of focusing their attacks on allegations of corruption in the Liberal government as they did earlier on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Ipsos-Reid Poll conducted after the fallout from the first report of the Gomery Commission on the sponsorship scandal showed the Tories practically tied for public support with the governing Liberal Party,[42] and a poll from the Strategic Counsel suggested that the Conservatives were actually in the lead. However, polling two days later showed the Liberals had regained an 8-point lead.[43] On 24 November 2005 Opposition leader Stephen Harper introduced a motion of no confidence which was passed on 28 November 2005. With the confirmed backing of the other two opposition parties, this resulted in an election on 23 January 2006 following a campaign spanning the Christmas season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conservatives started off the first month of the campaign by making a series of policy-per-day announcements, which included a Goods and Services Tax reduction and a child-care allowance. This strategy was a surprise to many in the news media, as they believed the party would focus on the sponsorship scandal; instead, the Conservative strategy was to let that issue ruminate with voters. The Liberals opted to hold their major announcements after the Christmas holidays; as a result, Harper dominated media coverage for the first few weeks of the campaign and was able \\"to define himself, rather than to let the Liberals define him\\". The Conservatives' announcements played to Harper's strengths as a policy wonk,[44] as opposed to the 2004 election and summer 2005 where he tried to overcome the perception that he was cool and aloof. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal approval numbers, which had always trailed his party's significantly, began to rise relatively rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 27 December 2005 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced it was investigating Liberal Finance Minister Ralph Goodale's office for potentially engaging in insider trading before making an important announcement on the taxation of income trusts. The revelation of the criminal investigation and Goodale's refusal to step aside dominated news coverage for the following week, and it gained further attention when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced they would also launch a probe. The income trust scandal distracted public attention from the Liberals' key policy announcements and allowed the Conservatives to refocus on their previous attacks on corruption within the Liberal party. The Tories were leading in the polls by early January 2006, and made a major breakthrough in Quebec where they displaced the Liberals as the second place party (after the Bloc Qubcois).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the growing Conservative lead, the Liberals launched negative ads suggesting that Harper had a \\"hidden agenda\\", similar to the attacks made in the 2004 election. The Liberal ads did not have the same effect this time as the Conservatives had much more momentum, at one stage holding a ten-point lead. Harper's personal numbers continued to rise and polls found he was considered not only more trustworthy, but also a better potential Prime Minister than Paul Martin. In addition to the Conservatives being more disciplined, media coverage of the Conservatives was also more positive than in 2004. By contrast, the Liberals found themselves increasingly criticized for running a poor campaign and making numerous gaffes.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 January 2006 the Conservatives won 124 seats, compared to 103 for the Liberals. The results made the Conservatives the largest party in the 308-member House of Commons, enabling them to form a minority government. On 6 February, Harper was sworn in as the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada, along with his Cabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 September 2008 Stephen Harper asked the Governor General of Canada to dissolve parliament. The election took place on 14 October. The Conservative Party returned to government with 143 seats, up from the 127 seats they held at dissolution, but short of the 155 necessary for a majority government. This was the third minority parliament in a row, and the second for Harper. The Conservative Party pitched the election as a choice between Harper and the Liberals' Stphane Dion, whom they portrayed as a weak and ineffective leader. The election, however, was rocked midway through by the emerging global financial crisis and this became the central issue through to the end of the campaign. Harper has been criticised for appearing unresponsive and unsympathetic to the uncertainty Canadians were feeling during the period of financial turmoil, but he countered that the Conservatives were the best party to navigate Canada through the financial crisis, and portrayed the Liberal \\"Green Shift\\" plan as reckless and detrimental to Canada's economic well-being. The Conservative Party released its platform on 7 October.[45] The platform states that it will re-introduce a bill similar to C-61.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe partys second convention was held in Winnipeg in November 2008. This was the party's first convention since taking power in 2006, and media coverage concentrated on the fact that this time, the convention was not very policy-oriented, and showed the party to be becoming an establishment party. However, the results of voting at the convention reveal that the partys populist side still had some life. A resolution that would have allowed the party president a director of the partys fund was defeated because it also permitted the twelve directors of the fund to become unelected ex officio delegates.[47] Some controversial policy resolutions were debated, including one to encourage provinces to utilize \\"both the public and private health sectors\\", but most of these were defeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the election of a Liberal Government in the 2015 General Election, the Party announced that Stephen Harper was stepping down as leader and that an interim leader would be selected to serve until a new leader could be chosen.[48] That was completed at the caucus meeting of 5 November 2015[49] where Rona Ambrose MP for Sturgeon RiverParkland and a former cabinet minister was elected by a vote of MPs and Senators.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome members of the partys national council were calling for a leadership convention as early as May 2016 according to Maclean's magazine.[51] However, some other Members of Parliament wanted the vote to be delayed until the spring of 2017.[52] On 19 January 2016, the party announced that a permanent leader will be chosen on 27 May 2017.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 28, 2016, Scheer announced his bid for the leadership of the Conservative Party, and that he had the support of 32 members of the Conservative caucus.[53] On May 27, 2017, Scheer was elected as the second full-time leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, beating runner up MP Maxime Bernier and more than 12 others with 50.95% of the vote through 13 rounds.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conservative Party has historically been strongest in the Canadian Prairies,[55][56] particularly the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, where it holds 24 out of 29 and 10 out of 14 federal seats respectively. It tends to be weaker in Quebec and Atlantic Canada, particularly Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island.[57][58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Conservative Party, while having no provincial wings, largely works with the former federal Progressive Conservative Party's provincial affiliates. There have been calls to change the names of the provincial parties from \\"Progressive Conservative\\" to \\"Conservative\\". However, there are other small \\"c\\" conservative parties with which the federal Conservative Party has close ties, such as the Saskatchewan Party and the British Columbia Liberal Party (not associated with the federal Liberal Party of Canada). The federal Conservative Party has the support of many of the provincial Conservative leaders. In Ontario, successive provincial PC Party leaders John Tory, Bob Runciman and Tim Hudak have expressed open support for Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party of Canada, while former Mike Harris cabinet members Tony Clement, and John Baird were ministers in Harper's government.[citation needed] In Quebec, businessman Adrien D. Pouliot leads a new Conservative Party of Qubec which was formed in 2009 in the wake of the decline of the Action dmocratique du Qubec (ADQ) which had carried the support of many provincial conservatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nCross-support between federal and provincial Conservatives is more tenuous in some other provinces. In Alberta, relations became strained between the federal Conservative Party and the Progressive Conservatives. Part of the federal Tories' loss in the 2004 election was often blamed on then Premier Klein's public musings on health care late in the campaign. Klein had also called for a referendum on same-sex marriage. With the impending 2006 election, Klein predicted another Liberal minority, though this time the federal Conservatives won a minority government. Klein's successor Ed Stelmach tried to avoid causing similar controversies; however, Harper's surprise pledge to restrict bitumen exports drew a sharp rebuke from the Albertan government, who warned such restrictions would violate both the Constitution of Canada and the North American Free Trade Agreement. The rise of the Wildrose Party in Alberta has caused a further rift between the federal Conservatives and the Albertan PCs, as some Conservative backbench MPs endorse Wildrose. For the 2012 Alberta election, Prime Minister Harper remained neutral and instructed federal cabinet members to also remain neutral while allowing Conservative backbenchers to back whomever they chose if they wish. Wildrose candidates for the concurrent Senate nominee election announced they would sit in the Conservative caucus should they be appointed to the Senate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 2007 budget was announced, the Progressive Conservative governments in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland & Labrador accused the federal Conservatives of breaching the terms of the Atlantic Accord.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, relations worsened between the two provincial governments, leading Newfoundland & Labrador Premier Danny Williams to denounce the federal Conservatives, which gave rise to his ABC (Anything But Conservative) campaign in the 2008 election.","input":"What does the canadian conservative party stand for?"},{"output":"George Washington's only military surrender","context":"?Great Britain\\r\\nThe Battle of Fort Necessity (also called the Battle of the Great Meadows) took place on July 3, 1754, in what is now the mountaintop hamlet of Farmington in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. The engagement was one of the first battles of the French and Indian War and George Washington's only military surrender. The battle, along with the May 28 Battle of Jumonville Glen, contributed to a series of military escalations that resulted in the global Seven Years' War.\\r\\nWashington built Fort Necessity on an alpine meadow west of the summit of a pass through the Allegheny Mountains. Another pass nearby leads to Confluence, Pennsylvania; to the west, Nemacolin's Trail begins its descent to Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and other parts of Fayette County along the relatively low altitudes of the Allegheny Plateau.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the 1740s and early 1750s, British and French traders had increasingly come into contact in the Ohio Country, including the upper watershed of the Ohio River in what is now western Pennsylvania.[4] Authorities in New France became more aggressive in their efforts to expel British traders and colonists from this area, and in 1753 began construction of a series of fortifications in the area.[5] In previous wars, the Qubecois had more than held their own against the English colonials.[6]\\r\\nThe French action drew the attention of not just the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders became successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all.[7] The reason for this was that they had to provide them with the goods that the Anglo-American traders had previously supplied, and at similar prices. This proved to be singularly difficult. With the exception of one or two Montreal merchant traders, the Canadians showed a great reluctance to venture into the Ohio country.[8] In particular, Tanacharison, a Mingo chief also known as the \\"Half King\\", became anti-French as a consequence. In a meeting with Paul Marin de la Malgue, commander of the Canadian construction force, the latter reportedly lost his temper, and shouted at the Indian chief, \\"I tell you, down the river I will go. If the river is blocked up, I have the forces to burst it open and tread under my feet all that oppose me. I despise all the stupid things you have said.\\"[9] He then threw down some wampum that Tanacharison had offered as a good will gesture.[9] Marin died not long after, and command of the operations was turned over to Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre.[10]\\r\\nVirginia colonial Lieutenant Colonel George Washington was sent by Governor Robert Dinwiddie to travel from Williamsburg to Fort LeBeouf in the Ohio Territory (a territory claimed by several of the British colonies, including Virginia) as an emissary in December 1753, to deliver a letter. Saint-Pierre politely informed Washington that he was there pursuant to orders, and Washington's letter should have been addressed to his commanding officer in Canada.[11]\\r\\nWashington returned to Williamsburg and informed Governor Dinwiddie that the French refused to leave.[12] Dinwiddie ordered Washington to begin raising a militia regiment to hold the Forks of the Ohio, in present-day Pittsburgh, a site Washington had identified as a fine location for a fortress.[13] The governor also issued a captain's commission to Ohio Company employee William Trent, with instructions to raise a small force and immediately begin construction of a fortification on the Ohio. Dinwiddie issued these instructions on his own authority, without even asking for funding from the Virginia House of Burgesses until after the fact.[14] Trent's company arrived on site in February 1754, and began construction of a storehouse and stockade with the assistance of Tanacharison and the Mingos.[14][15] In response, the Canadians sent a force of about 500 men, Canadian, French, and Indians under Claude-Pierre Pcaudy de Contrec?ur (rumors reaching Trent's men put its size at 1,000). On April 16, they arrived at the forks; the next day, Trent's force of 36 men, led by Ensign Edward Ward in Trent's absence, agreed to leave the site.[16] The Canadians tore down the British works, and began construction of the fort they called Fort Duquesne.[17]\\r\\nIn March 1754, Governor Dinwiddie sent Washington back to the frontier with orders to \\"act on the [defensive], but in Case any Attempts are made to obstruct the Works or interrupt our [settlements] by any Persons whatsoever, You are to restrain all such Offenders, & in Case of resistance to make Prisoners of or kill & destroy them\\". Historian Fred Anderson describes Dinwiddie's instructions, which were issued without the knowledge or direction of the British government in London, as \\"an invitation to start a war\\".[18] Washington was ordered to gather as many supplies and paid volunteers as he could along the way. By the time he left for the frontier on April 2, he had gathered 186 men.[19]\\r\\nContrec?ur operated under orders that forbade attacks by his force unless they were provoked. On May 23, he sent Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville with 35?men to see if Washington had entered French territory, and with a summons to order Washington's troops to leave; this summons was similar in nature to the one Washington had delivered to them four months previous.[20] Sources disagree on the exact composition of Jumonville's force, which may have included French troupes de la marine, Canadian militia, and Indians.[21][22]\\r\\nDuring the march through the forests of the frontier, Washington received a few more men from another regiment that they met at Winchester.[19] At this point Captain Trent arrived with news of the advance of the French force under Jumonville. Trent was accompanied by Tanacharison, who promised warriors to assist the British.[19] To keep Tanacharison's support, Washington decided not to turn back, choosing instead to build a fortification 37 miles (60?km) south of the forks and await further instructions.[23]\\r\\nWashington sent out Captain Hog with 75 men to pursue French troops who had threatened to destroy his house and property.[24] However, shortly after Hog left, Washington called together some young Indians and told them that the French had come to kill Tanacharison, and the Indians also left to pursue the French. That evening, Washington received a message from Tanacharison, who said he had found the French encampment.[25] Washington decided to attack himself and brought 40 soldiers with him towards Tanacharison's camp. That morning, they met with Tanacharison's 12 Indian warriors, and Washington and Tanacharison agreed to attack the encampment.[26] Washington ambushed the French, killing 10 to 12, wounding 2 and capturing 21.[27] Among the dead was Jumonville; the exact manner of his death is uncertain, but by several accounts Tanacharison executed Jumonville in cold blood, crushing his head with a tomahawk and washing his hands in Jumonville's brains.[27] One account, reported by an Indian to Contrec?ur, claimed that Jumonville was killed by Half King while the summons was being read.[28]\\r\\nAfter retiring from Jumonville, Washington expected to be attacked.[29] Tanacharison attempted to convince the Delaware, Shawnee and the Seneca Indians to join the Virginians at Great Meadows. With about 150 Virginians at Great Meadows, they began to construct a fort, which was completed on June 3.[29] The fort, which Washington named Fort Necessity.\\r\\nBy June 9, the rest of the Virginia Regiment arrived at Great Meadows, excluding Colonel Joshua Fry, who had fallen from his horse, broken his neck and died.[1] Washington took his place as colonel. A few days later, 100 British regulars under the command of James Mackay arrived, but, instead of making camp with the Virginians, they camped separately outside the fort.[1]\\r\\nWashington had heard that there were 500 poorly supplied French troops at Fort Duquesne, and thus he led the 300 Virginians out of Great Meadows on June 16 to widen the road, for he had been unable to convince the other chiefs to assist. They had said that they would also be unable to help the Virginians. Although he had lost Indian support, which made his troops more vulnerable to attack, Washington continued to widen the road towards Red Stone Creek.\\r\\nOn June 28, after a council of war, Washington ordered the withdrawal to Great Meadows. That same day 600 French, and 100 Indians left Fort Duquesne led by the slain Jumonville's older brother, Louis Coulon de Villiers. In order to keep ahead of the French/Canadian force, the Virginians had to abandon most of their supplies. On July 1, they reached Fort Necessity.[30]\\r\\nAt Fort Necessity, the provision hut was depleted, and there was little shelter from the heavy rain that started to fall on the 2nd.[31] With the rain, the trenches that Washington had ordered to be dug had turned into streams. Washington realized that he would have to defend against a frontal assault and also realized that it would be difficult because the woods were less than 100 yards away, within musket range, making it possible for a besieging attacker to pick off the defenders.[2] To improve the defense, Washington ordered his men to cut trees down and to make them into makeshift breastworks.[2]\\r\\nAs the British worked, Coulon approached Fort Necessity using the road the Virginians had built.[2] He arrived at Jumonville's Glen early on the morning of July 3. Horrified to find several scalped French bodies, he immediately ordered them to be buried.[2]\\r\\nBy 11:00 am on the 3rd of July 1754, Louis Coulon de Villiers came within sight of Fort Necessity.[2] At this time, the Virginians were digging a trench in the mud. The pickets fired their muskets and fell back to the fort, whereupon three columns of Canadian soldiers and Indians advanced downhill towards the fort.[2] However, Coulon had miscalculated the location of the fort and had advanced with the fort at his right. As Coulon halted and then redeployed his troops, Washington began to prepare for an attack.[2]\\r\\nCoulon moved his troops into the woods, within easy musket range of the fort.[2] Washington knew he had to dislodge the Canadians and Indians from that position, so he ordered an assault with his entire force across the open field. Seeing the assault coming, Coulon ordered his soldiers, led by Indians, to charge directly at Washington's line.[32] Washington ordered the men to hold their ground and fire a volley. Mackay's regulars obeyed Washington's command, and supported by two swivel cannons, they inflicted several casualties on the oncoming Indians.[32] The Virginians, however, fled back to the fort, leaving Washington and the British regulars greatly outnumbered. Washington ordered a retreat back to the fort.[32]\\r\\nCoulon reformed his troops in the woods.[32] The Canadians spread out around the clearing and kept up heavy fire on Fort Necessity. Washington ordered his troops to return fire, but they aimed too high, inflicting few casualties, and the swivel cannon fared no better.[32] To add to the garrison's troubles, heavy rain began to fall that afternoon, and Washington's troops were unable to continue the firefight because their gunpowder was wet.[32]\\r\\nLouis Coulon de Villiers, who did not know when British reinforcements might arrive, sent an officer under a white flag to negotiate.[33] Washington did not allow the Canadian officer into or near the fort, but sent two of his own men, including his translator Jacob Van Braam, to negotiate. As negotiations began, the Virginians, against Washington's orders, broke into the fort's liquor supply and got drunk.[33] Coulon told Van Braam that all he wanted was the surrender of the garrison, and the Virginians could go back to Virginia. He warned, however, that if they did not surrender now, the Indians might storm the fort and scalp the entire garrison.[33]\\r\\nVan Braam brought this message to Washington, who agreed to these basic terms.[33] One of Louis Coulon de Villiers' aides then wrote down Coulon's surrender terms and then gave them to Van Braam, who in turn gave them to Washington. Washington, who could not read French, had Van Braam translate it for him, and in the document it said that Jumonville had been \\"assassinated\\".[33] However, Van Braam may have skipped over this word; otherwise Washington would have likely sent it back to Coulon and asked that the word be removed. Both Washington and Mackay signed the surrender document.[33]\\r\\nOn July 4, Washington and his troops abandoned Fort Necessity.[34] The garrison marched away with drums beating and flags flying, but the Indians and the French began to loot the garrison's baggage on their way out. Washington, who feared a bloodbath, did not try to stop the looting.[34] The Indians continued to steal from the soldiers until July 5. Washington and his troops arrived back in eastern Virginia in mid-July.[35] On the 17th, Washington delivered his report of the battles to Governor Dinwiddie, expecting a rebuke, but Washington instead received a vote of thanks from the House of Burgesses and Dinwiddie blamed the defeat not on Washington but on poor supply and the refusal of aid by the other colonies.[35]\\r\\nThe battlefield is preserved at Fort Necessity National Battlefield, and includes a reconstruction of Fort Necessity.\\r\\nWhen news of the two battles reached England in August, the government of the Duke of Newcastle, after several months of negotiations, decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French.[36] Major General Edward Braddock was chosen to lead the expedition.[37] His expedition ended in disaster, and the French remained in control of Fort Duquesne until 1758, when an expedition under General John Forbes finally succeeded in taking the fort.[38]\\r\\nWord of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock's departure for North America, and King Louis XV dispatched a much larger body of troops to Canada in 1755.[39] Although they arrived too late to participate in Braddock's defeat, the French troop presence led to a string of French victories in the following years. In a second British act of aggression, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide in a naval action on June 8, 1755, capturing her and two troop ships carrying some of those troops.[40] Military matters escalated on both North American soil and sea until France and Britain declared war on each other in spring 1756, marking the formal start of the Seven Years' War.[41]","input":"What happened in the battle of fort necessity?"},{"output":"seven","context":"\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" (French: La Belle au bois dormant \\"The Beauty in the sleeping Wood\\") by Charles Perrault, or \\"Little Briar Rose\\" (German: Dornr?schen), is a classic fairy tale which involves a beautiful princess, a sleeping enchantment, and a handsome prince. The version collected by the Brothers Grimm was an orally transmitted version of the originally literary tale published by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps pass in 1697.[1] This in turn was based on Sun, Moon, and Talia by Italian poet Giambattista Basile (published posthumously in 1634), which was in turn based on one or more folk tales. The earliest known version of the story is found in the narrative Perceforest, composed between 1330 and 1344 and first printed in 1528.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPerraults narrative is written in two parts, which some folklorists believe were originally separate tales, as they were in the Brothers Grimm's version, and were later joined together by Giambattista Basile and once more by Perrault.[2]\\r\\nAt the christening of a king and queen's long-wished-for child, seven good fairies are invited to be godmothers to the infant princess. The fairies attend the banquet at the palace. Each fairy is presented with a golden plate and drinking cups adorned with jewels. Soon after, an old fairy enters the palace and is seated with a plate of fine china and a crystal drinking glass. This old fairy is overlooked because she has been within a tower for many years and everyone had believed her to be deceased. Six of the other seven fairies then offer their gifts of beauty, wit, grace, dance, song, and goodness to the infant princess. The evil fairy is very angry about having been forgotten, and as her gift, enchants the infant princess so that she will one day prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The seventh fairy, who hasn't yet given her gift, attempts to reverse the evil fairy's curse. However, she can only do so partially. Instead of dying, the Princess will fall into a deep sleep for 100 years and be awakened by a kiss from a king's son.\\r\\nThe King orders that every spindle and spinning wheel in the kingdom to be destroyed, to try to save his daughter from the terrible curse. Fifteen or sixteen years pass and one day, when the king and queen are away, the Princess wanders through the palace rooms and comes upon an old woman, spinning with her spindle. The princess, who has never seen anyone spin before, asks the old woman if she can try the spinning wheel. The curse is fulfilled as the princess pricks her finger on the spindle and instantly falls into a deep sleep. The old woman cries for help and attempts are made to revive the princess. The king attributes this to fate and has the Princess carried to the finest room in the palace and placed upon a bed of gold and silver embroidered fabric. The king and queen kiss their daughter goodbye and depart, proclaiming the entrance to be forbidden. The good fairy who altered the evil prophecy is summoned. Having great powers of foresight, the fairy sees that the Princess will awaken to distress when she finds herself alone, so the fairy puts everyone in the castle to sleep. The fairy also summons a forest of trees, brambles and thorns that spring up around the castle, shielding it from the outside world and preventing anyone from disturbing the Princess.\\r\\nA hundred years pass and a prince from another family spies the hidden castle during a hunting expedition. His attendants tell him differing stories regarding the castle until an old man recounts his father's words: within the castle lies a beautiful princess who is doomed to sleep for a hundred years until a king's son comes and awakens her. The prince then braves the tall trees, brambles and thorns which part at his approach, and enters the castle. He passes the sleeping castle folk and comes across the chamber where the Princess lies asleep on the bed. Struck by the radiant beauty before him, he falls on his knees before her. The enchantment comes to an end by a kiss and the princess awakens and converses with the prince for a long time. Meanwhile, the rest of the castle awakens and go about their business. The prince and princess are later married by the chaplain in the castle chapel.\\r\\nAfter wedding the Princess in secret, the Prince continues to visit her and she bears him two children, Aurore (Dawn) and Jour (Day), unbeknown to his mother, who is of an ogre lineage. When the time comes for the Prince to ascend the throne, he brings his wife, children, and the talabutte (\\"Count of the Mount\\").\\r\\nThe Ogress Queen Mother sends the young Queen and the children to a house secluded in the woods and directs her cook to prepare the boy with Sauce Robert for dinner. The kind-hearted cook substitutes a lamb for the boy, which satisfies the Queen Mother. She then demands the girl but the cook this time substitutes a young goat, which also satisfies the Queen Mother. When the Ogress demands that he serve up the young Queen, the latter offers to slit her throat so that she may join the children that she imagines are dead. While the Queen Mother is satisfied with a hind prepared with Sauce Robert in place of the young Queen, there is a tearful secret reunion of the Queen and her children. However, the Queen Mother soon discovers the cooks trick and she prepares a tub in the courtyard filled with vipers and other noxious creatures. The King returns in the nick of time and the Ogress, her true nature having been exposed, throws herself into the tub and is fully consumed. The King, young Queen, and children then live happily ever after.\\r\\nIn Giambattista Basile's version of Sleeping Beauty, Sun, Moon, and Talia, the sleeping beauty is named Talia. By asking wise men and astrologers to predict her future after her birth, her father who is a great lord learns that Talia will be in danger from a splinter of flax. The splinter later causes what appears to be Talia's death; however, it is later learned that it is a long, deep sleep. After Talia falls into deep sleep, she is seated on a velvet throne and her father, to forget his misery of what he thinks is her death, closes the doors and abandons the house forever. One day, while a king is walking by, one of his falcons flies into the house. The king knocks, hoping to be let in by someone, but no one answers and he decides to climb in with a ladder. He finds Talia alive but unconscious, and \\"...gathered the first fruits of love.\\" [3] Afterwards, he leaves her in the bed and goes back to his kingdom. Though Talia is unconscious, she gives birth to twins  one of whom keeps sucking her fingers. Talia awakens because the twin has sucked out the flax that was stuck deep in Talia's finger. When she wakes up, she discovers that she is a mother and has no idea what happened to her. One day, the king decides he wants to go see Talia again. He goes back to the palace to find her awake and a mother to his twins. He informs her of who he is, what has happened, and they end up bonding. After a few days, the king has to leave to go back to his realm, but promises Talia that he will return to take her to his kingdom.\\r\\nWhen he arrives back in his kingdom, his wife hears him saying \\"Talia, Sun, and Moon\\" in his sleep. She bribes and threatens the king's secretary to tell her what is going on. After the queen learns the truth, she pretends she is the king and writes to Talia asking her to send the twins because he wants to see them. Talia sends her twins to the \\"king\\" and the queen tells the cook to kill the twins and make dishes out of them. She wants to feed the king his children; instead, the cook takes the twins to his wife and hides them. He then cooks two lambs and serves them as if they were the twins. Every time the king mentions how good the food is, the queen replies, \\"Eat, eat, you are eating of your own.\\" Later, the queen invites Talia to the kingdom and is going to burn her alive, but the king appears and finds out whats going on with his children and Talia. He then orders that his wife be burned along with those who betrayed him. Since the cook actually did not obey the queen, the king thanks the cook for saving his children by giving him rewards. The story ends with the king marrying Talia and living happily ever after.[4]\\r\\nThere are earlier elements that contributed to the tale. In the medieval courtly romance Perceforest (published in 1528), a princess named Zellandine falls in love with a man named Troylus. Her father sends him to perform tasks to prove himself worthy of her, and while he is gone, Zellandine falls into an enchanted sleep. Troylus finds her and impregnates her in her sleep; when their child is born, he draws from her finger the flax that caused her sleep. She realizes from the ring he left her that the father was Troylus, who later returns to marry her.[5]\\r\\nEarlier influences come from the story of the sleeping Brynhild in the Volsunga saga and the tribulations of saintly female martyrs in early Christian hagiography conventions. It was, in fact, the existence of Brynhild that persuaded the Brothers Grimm to include the story in later editions of their work rather than eliminate it, as they did to other works they deemed to be purely French, stemming from Perrault's work. Their decision was odd on one point, at least, since in none of the Teutonic myths, meaning the Poetic and Prose Eddas or Volsunga Saga, is their sleeper awakened with a kiss, a fact Jacob Grimm would certainly have known, who wrote an important and encyclopedic volume on German Mythology.\\r\\nThe second half, in which the princess and her children are almost put to death, but instead hidden, may have been influenced by Genevieve of Brabant.[6]\\r\\nThe princess's name has varied from one adaptation to the other. In Sun, Moon, and Talia, she is named Talia (Sun and Moon being her twin children). She has no name in Perrault's story but her daughter is called \\"Aurore\\". The Brothers Grimm named her \\"Briar Rose\\" in their 1812 collection.[7] Tchaikovsky's ballet and Disney's version named her Princess Aurora; however, in the Disney version, she is also called \\"Briar Rose\\" in her childhood, when she is being raised incognito by the good fairies.[8] John Stejean named her \\"Rosebud\\" in TeleStory Presents.\\r\\nThe Brothers Grimm included a variant Little Briar Rose in their collection (1812).[7] Their version ends when the prince arrives to wake Sleeping Beauty, unlike the stories of Basile and Perrault.[9] Some translations of the Grimms' tale give the princess the name \\"Rosamond\\". The brothers considered rejecting the story on the grounds that it was derived from Perrault's version, but the presence of the Brynhild tale convinced them to include it as an authentically German tale. Still, it is the only known German variant of the tale, and Perrault's influence is almost certain.[10]\\r\\nThe Brothers Grimm also included, in the first edition of their tales, a fragmentary fairy tale, \\"The Evil Mother-in law\\". This story begins with the heroine a married mother of two children, as in the second part of Perrault's tale, and her mother-in-law attempting to eat her and the children. Unlike Perrault's version, the heroine suggested an animal be substituted in the dish, and ends with the heroine's worry that she cannot keep her children from crying and getting the mother-in-laws attention. Like many German tales showing French influence, it appeared in no subsequent edition.[11]\\r\\nItalo Calvino included a variant in Italian Folktales. The cause of her sleep is an ill-advised wish by her mother. As in Pentamerone, the prince rapes her in her sleep and her children are born. He retains the element that the woman who tries to kill the children is the king's mother, not his wife, but adds that she does not want to eat them herself, but instead serves them to the king. His version came from Calabria, but he noted that all Italian versions closely followed Basile's.[12][13]\\r\\nBesides Sun, Moon, and Talia, Basile included another variant of this Aarne-Thompson type, The Young Slave. The Grimms also included a second, more distantly related one, The Glass Coffin.[14]\\r\\nJoseph Jacobs noted that the figure of the Sleeping Beauty was in common between this tale and the Gypsy tale The King of England and his Three Sons, in his More English Fairy Tales.[15]\\r\\nThe hostility of the king's mother to his new bride is repeated in the fairy tale The Six Swans,[16] and also features The Twelve Wild Ducks, where she is modified to be the king's stepmother. However, these tales omit the attempted cannibalism.\\r\\nSome folklorists have analyzed Sleeping Beauty as indicating the replacement of the lunar year (with its thirteen months, symbolically depicted by the thirteen fairies) by the solar year (which has twelve, symbolically the invited fairies). The basic elements of the story can also be interpreted as a nature allegory: the princess represents nature, the wicked fairy godmother is winter, who puts the Court to sleep with pricks of frost until the prince (spring) cuts away the brambles with his sword (a sunbeam) to allow the Sun to awaken sleeping princess (nature).\\r\\nMichele Carafa composed La Belle au Bois Dormant in 1825.\\r\\nBefore Tchaikovsky's version, several ballet productions were based on the \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" theme, among one from Eugne Scribe: in the winter of 1828ÿ1829, the French playwright furnished a four-act mimed scenario as a basis for Aumer's choreography of a four-act ballet-pantomime La Belle au Bois Dormant.\\r\\nScribe wisely omitted the violence of the second part of Perrault's tale for the ballet, which was set by Hrold and first staged at the Acadmie Royale in Paris on 27 April 1829. Though Hrold popularized his piece with a piano, Rondo brilliant was based on themes from the music, however he was not successful in getting the ballet staged again.\\r\\nThe fourth movement of Robert Schumann's M?rchenbilder depicts scenes from this story.\\r\\nThe first movement of Ravel's Ma mre l'Oye in the original piano versions is Pavane de la Belle au bois dormant ( Sleeping Beauty's Pavane). The final movement, Le jardin ferique (The Fairy Garden) is interpreted in the ballet version as Sleeping Beauty being awakened in the garden by her prince.[21]\\r\\nWhen Ivan Vsevolozhsky, the Director of the Imperial Theatres in Saint Petersburg, wrote to Tchaikovsky on May 25, 1888 suggesting a ballet based on Perrault's tale, he also cut the violent second half, climaxed the action with the Awakening Kiss, and followed with a conventional festive last act, a series of bravura variations.\\r\\nIn 2008, the American musical trio GrooveLily released Sleeping Beauty Wakes, a concept modern-day album, loosely based on the fairy tale. The songs are part of a homonymous musical with book by Rachel Sheinkin.\\r\\nAbby Dobson released Sleeping Beauty: You Are the One You Have Been Waiting On ÿ Volumood One, her debut album, loosely based on the fairy tale.\\r\\nSleeping Beauty, by Alexander Zick (1845ÿ1907)\\r\\nHe standshe stoops to gazehe kneelshe wakes her with a kiss, woodcut by Walter Crane\\r\\nPrince Florimund finds the \\"Sleeping Beauty\\"\\r\\nSleeping Beauty by Jenny Harbour\\r\\nPerrault's La Belle au bois dormant (Sleeping Beauty), illustration by Gustave Dor\\r\\nBook cover for a Dutch interpretation of the story by Johann Georg van Caspel\\r\\nBriar Rose\\r\\nSleeping Beauty by Edward Frederick Brewtnall\\r\\nLouis Su?mann-Hellborn (1828- 1908) Sleeping Beauty,\\r\\nSleeping Princess by Viktor Vasnetsov\\r\\nThe Sleeping Beauty by Sir Edward Burne-Jones\\r\\nSleeping Beauty, statue in Wuppertal ÿ Germany","input":"How many fairies in the original sleeping beauty?"},{"output":"291 episodes","context":"Dragon Ball Z (´ʾλδ, Doragon Bru Zetto, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) is the long-running anime sequel to the Dragon Ball TV series, adapted from the final twenty-six volumes of the Dragon Ball manga written by Akira Toriyama.

It traces the historical development of the English language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world.[2][3] The second edition came to 21,728 pages in 20 volumes, published in 1989.\\r\\nWork began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was not until 1884 that it began to be published in unbound fascicles as work continued on the project, under the name of A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society. In 1895, the title The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) was first used unofficially on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in ten bound volumes. In 1933, the title The Oxford English Dictionary fully replaced the former name in all occurrences in its reprinting as twelve volumes with a one-volume supplement. More supplements came over the years until 1989, when the second edition was published.[1] Since 2000, a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, approximately half of which is now complete.[1]\\r\\nThe first electronic version of the dictionary was made available in 1988. The online version has been available since 2000, and as of April 2014 was receiving over two million hits per month. The third edition of the dictionary will probably only appear in electronic form; Nigel Portwood, chief executive of Oxford University Press, thinks it unlikely that it will ever be printed.[4][5][1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a historical dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary explains words by showing their development rather than merely their present-day usages.[6] Therefore, it shows definitions in the order that the sense of the word began being used, including word meanings which are no longer used. Each definition is shown with numerous short usage quotations; in each case, the first quotation shows the first recorded instance of the word that the editors are aware of and, in the case of words and senses no longer in current usage, the last quotation is the last known recorded usage. This allows the reader to get an approximate sense of the time period in which a particular word has been in use, and additional quotations help the reader to ascertain information about how the word is used in context, beyond any explanation that the dictionary editors can provide.\\r\\nThe format of the OED's entries has influenced numerous other historical lexicography projects. The forerunners to the OED, such as the early volumes of the Deutsches W?rterbuch, had initially provided few quotations from a limited number of sources, whereas the OED editors preferred larger groups of quite short quotations from a wide selection of authors and publications. This influenced later volumes of this and other lexicographical works.[7]\\r\\nAccording to the publishers, it would take a single person 120 years to \\"key in\\" the 59 million words of the OED second edition, 60 years to proofread them, and 540 megabytes to store them electronically.[8] As of 30 November 2005, the Oxford English Dictionary contained approximately 301,100 main entries. Supplementing the entry headwords, there are 157,000 bold-type combinations and derivatives;[9] 169,000 italicized-bold phrases and combinations;[10] 616,500 word-forms in total, including 137,000 pronunciations; 249,300 etymologies; 577,000 cross-references; and 2,412,400 usage quotations. The dictionary's latest, complete print edition (second edition, 1989) was printed in 20 volumes, comprising 291,500 entries in 21,730 pages. The longest entry in the OED2 was for the verb set, which required 60,000 words to describe some 430 senses. As entries began to be revised for the OED3 in sequence starting from M, the longest entry became make in 2000, then put in 2007, then run in 2011.[11][12][13]\\r\\nDespite its impressive size, the OED is neither the world's largest nor the earliest exhaustive dictionary of a language. Another earlier large dictionary is the Grimm brothers' dictionary of the German language, begun in 1838 and completed in 1961. The first edition of the Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca is the first great dictionary devoted to a modern European language (Italian) and was published in 1612; the first edition of Dictionnaire de l'Acadmie fran?aise dates from 1694. The official dictionary of Spanish is the Diccionario de la lengua espa?ola (produced, edited, and published by the Real Academia Espa?ola), and its first edition was published in 1780. The Kangxi dictionary of Chinese was published in 1716.[14]\\r\\nThe dictionary began as a Philological Society project of a small group of intellectuals in London (and unconnected to Oxford University):[15]:103ÿ4,112 Richard Chenevix Trench, Herbert Coleridge, and Frederick Furnivall, who were dissatisfied with the existing English dictionaries. The Society expressed interest in compiling a new dictionary as early as 1844,[16] but it was not until June 1857 that they began by forming an \\"Unregistered Words Committee\\" to search for words that were unlisted or poorly defined in current dictionaries. In November, Trench's report was not a list of unregistered words; instead, it was the study On Some Deficiencies in our English Dictionaries, which identified seven distinct shortcomings in contemporary dictionaries:[17]\\r\\nThe Society ultimately realized that the number of unlisted words would be far more than the number of words in the English dictionaries of the 19th century, and shifted their idea from covering only words that were not already in English dictionaries to a larger project. Trench suggested that a new, truly comprehensive dictionary was needed. On 7 January 1858, the Society formally adopted the idea of a comprehensive new dictionary.[15]:107ÿ8 Volunteer readers would be assigned particular books, copying passages illustrating word usage onto quotation slips. Later the same year, the Society agreed to the project in principle, with the title A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (NED).[18]:ixÿx\\r\\nRichard Chenevix Trench (1807ÿ1886) played the key role in the project's first months, but his Church of England appointment as Dean of Westminster meant that he could not give the dictionary project the time that it required. He withdrew and Herbert Coleridge became the first editor.[19]:8ÿ9\\r\\nOn 12 May 1860, Coleridge's dictionary plan was published and research was started. His house was the first editorial office. He arrayed 100,000 quotation slips in a 54 pigeon-hole grid.[19]:9 In April 1861, the group published the first sample pages; later that month, Coleridge died of tuberculosis, aged 30.[18]:x\\r\\nFurnivall then became editor; he was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, yet temperamentally ill-suited for the work.[15]:110 Many volunteer readers eventually lost interest in the project, as Furnivall failed to keep them motivated. Furthermore, many of the slips had been misplaced.\\r\\nFurnivall believed that, since many printed texts from earlier centuries were not readily available, it would be impossible for volunteers to efficiently locate the quotations that the dictionary needed. As a result, he founded the Early English Text Society in 1864 and the Chaucer Society in 1868 to publish old manuscripts.[18]:xii Furnivall's preparatory efforts lasted 21 years and provided numerous texts for the use and enjoyment of the general public, as well as crucial sources for lexicographers, but they did not actually involve compiling a dictionary. Furnivall recruited more than 800 volunteers to read these texts and record quotations. While enthusiastic, the volunteers were not well trained and often made inconsistent and arbitrary selections. Ultimately, Furnivall handed over nearly two tons of quotation slips and other materials to his successor.[20]\\r\\nIn the 1870s, Furnivall unsuccessfully attempted to recruit both Henry Sweet and Henry Nicol to succeed him. He then approached James Murray, who accepted the post of editor. In the late 1870s, Furnivall and Murray met with several publishers about publishing the dictionary. In 1878, Oxford University Press agreed with Murray to proceed with the massive project; the agreement was formalized the following year.[15]:111ÿ2 The dictionary project finally had a publisher 20 years after the idea was conceived. It was another 50 years before the entire dictionary was complete.\\r\\nLate in his editorship, Murray learned that a prolific reader named W. C. Minor was a criminal lunatic.[15]:xiii Minor was a Yale University-trained surgeon and military officer in the American Civil War, and was confined to Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane after killing a man in London. Minor invented his own quotation-tracking system, allowing him to submit slips on specific words in response to editors' requests. The story of Murray and Minor later served as the central focus of The Surgeon of Crowthorne (US title: The Professor and the Madman[15]), a popular book about the creation of the OED.\\r\\nDuring the 1870s, the Philological Society was concerned with the process of publishing a dictionary with such an immense scope.[1] They had pages printed by publishers, but no publication agreement was reached; both the Cambridge University Press and the Oxford University Press were approached. The OUP finally agreed in 1879 (after two years of negotiating by Sweet, Furnivall, and Murray) to publish the dictionary and to pay Murray, who was both the editor and the Philological Society president. The dictionary was to be published as interval fascicles, with the final form in four volumes, totalling 6,400 pages. They hoped to finish the project in ten years.[19]:1\\r\\nMurray started the project, working in a corrugated iron outbuilding called the \\"Scriptorium\\" which was lined with wooden planks, book shelves, and 1,029 pigeon-holes for the quotation slips.[18]:xiii He tracked and regathered Furnivall's collection of quotation slips, which were found to concentrate on rare, interesting words rather than common usages. For instance, there were ten times as many quotations for abusion as for abuse.[21] He appealed, through newspapers distributed to bookshops and libraries, for readers who would report \\"as many quotations as you can for ordinary words\\" and for words that were \\"rare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar or used in a peculiar way\\".[22] Murray had American philologist and liberal arts college professor Francis March manage the collection in North America; 1,000 quotation slips arrived daily to the Scriptorium and, by 1880, there were 2,500,000.[19]:15\\r\\nThe first dictionary fascicle was published on 1 February 1884twenty-three years after Coleridge's sample pages. The full title was A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles; Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philological Society; the 352-page volume, words from A to Ant, cost 12s 6d.[19]:251 (or about $668.24 in 2013) The total sales were a disappointing 4,000 copies.[23]:169\\r\\nThe OUP saw that it would take too long to complete the work with unrevised editorial arrangements. Accordingly, new assistants were hired and two new demands were made on Murray.[19]:32ÿ33 The first was that he move from Mill Hill to Oxford, which he did in 1885. Murray had his Scriptorium re-erected on his new property.[18]:xvii\\r\\nMurray resisted the second demand: that if he could not meet schedule, he must hire a second, senior editor to work in parallel to him, outside his supervision, on words from elsewhere in the alphabet. Murray did not want to share the work, feeling that he would accelerate his work pace with experience. That turned out not to be so, and Philip Gell of the OUP forced the promotion of Murray's assistant Henry Bradley (hired by Murray in 1884), who worked independently in the British Museum in London beginning in 1888. In 1896, Bradley moved to Oxford University.[19]\\r\\nGell continued harassing Murray and Bradley with his business concernscontaining costs and speeding productionto the point where the project's collapse seemed likely. Newspapers reported the harassment, particularly the Saturday Review, and public opinion backed the editors.[23]:182ÿ83 Gell was fired, and the university reversed his cost policies. If the editors felt that the dictionary would have to grow larger, it would; it was an important work, and worth the time and money to properly finish.\\r\\nNeither Murray nor Bradley lived to see it. Murray died in 1915, having been responsible for words starting with AÿD, HÿK, OÿP, and T, nearly half the finished dictionary; Bradley died in 1923, having completed EÿG, LÿM, SÿSh, St, and WÿWe. By then, two additional editors had been promoted from assistant work to independent work, continuing without much trouble. William Craigie started in 1901 and was responsible for N, QÿR, SiÿSq, UÿV, and WoÿWy.[18]:xix The OUP had previously thought London too far from Oxford but, after 1925, Craigie worked on the dictionary in Chicago, where he was a professor.[18]:xix[19] The fourth editor was Charles Talbut Onions, who compiled the remaining ranges starting in 1914: SuÿSz, WhÿWo, and XÿZ.[24]\\r\\nIn 1919ÿ1920, J. R. R. Tolkien was employed by the OED, researching etymologies of the Waggle to Warlock range;[25] later he parodied the principal editors as \\"The Four Wise Clerks of Oxenford\\" in the story Farmer Giles of Ham.[26]\\r\\nBy early 1894, a total of 11 fascicles had been published, or about one per year: four for AÿB, five for C, and two for E.[18] Of these, eight were 352 pages long, while the last one in each group was shorter to end at the letter break (which eventually became a volume break). At this point, it was decided to publish the work in smaller and more frequent instalments; once every three months beginning in 1895 there would be a fascicle of 64 pages, priced at 2s 6d. If enough material was ready, 128 or even 192 pages would be published together. This pace was maintained until World War I forced reductions in staff.[18]:xx Each time enough consecutive pages were available, the same material was also published in the original larger fascicles.[18]:xx Also in 1895, the title Oxford English Dictionary (OED) was first used. It then appeared only on the outer covers of the fascicles; the original title was still the official one and was used everywhere else.[18]:xx\\r\\nThe 125th and last fascicle covered words from Wise to the end of W and was published on 19 April 1928, and the full dictionary in bound volumes followed immediately.[18]:xx\\r\\nWilliam Shakespeare is the most-quoted writer in the completed dictionary, with Hamlet his most-quoted work. George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) is the most-quoted female writer. Collectively, the Bible is the most-quoted work (but in many different translations); the most-quoted single work is Cursor Mundi.[8]\\r\\nBetween 1928 and 1933, enough additional material had been compiled to make a one-volume supplement, so the dictionary was reissued as the set of 12 volumes and a one-volume supplement in 1933.[18]\\r\\nIn 1933, Oxford had finally put the dictionary to rest; all work ended, and the quotation slips went into storage. However, the English language continued to change and, by the time 20 years had passed, the dictionary was outdated.[27]\\r\\nThere were three possible ways to update it. The cheapest would have been to leave the existing work alone and simply compile a new supplement of perhaps one or two volumes; but then anyone looking for a word or sense and unsure of its age would have to look in three different places. The most convenient choice for the user would have been for the entire dictionary to be re-edited and retypeset, with each change included in its proper alphabetical place; but this would have been the most expensive option, with perhaps 15 volumes required to be produced. The OUP chose a middle approach: combining the new material with the existing supplement to form a larger replacement supplement.\\r\\nRobert Burchfield was hired in 1957 to edit the second supplement;[28] Onions turned 84 that year but was still able to make some contributions, as well. The work on the supplement was expected to take about seven years.[27] It actually took 29 years, by which time the new supplement (OEDS) had grown to four volumes, starting with A, H, O, and Sea. They were published in 1972, 1976, 1982, and 1986 respectively, bringing the complete dictionary to 16 volumes, or 17 counting the first supplement.\\r\\nBurchfield emphasized the inclusion of modern-day language and, through the supplement, the dictionary was expanded to include a wealth of new words from the burgeoning fields of science and technology, as well as popular culture and colloquial speech. Burchfield said that he broadened the scope to include developments of the language in English-speaking regions beyond the United Kingdom, including North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and the Caribbean. Burchfield also removed some smaller entries that had been added to the 1933 supplement, for reasons of space;[29] in 2012, an analysis by lexicographer Sarah Ogilvie revealed that many of these entries were in fact foreign loanwords, despite Burchfield's attempt to include more such words. The proportion was estimated from a sample calculation to amount to 17% of the foreign loan words and words from regional forms of English. Many of these had only a single recorded usage, but it ran against what was thought to be the established OED editorial practice and a perception that he had opened up the dictionary to \\"World English\\".[30][31][32]\\r\\nBy the time the new supplement was completed, it was clear that the full text of the dictionary would now need to be computerized. Achieving this would require retyping it once, but thereafter it would always be accessible for computer searching?ÿ as well as for whatever new editions of the dictionary might be desired, starting with an integration of the supplementary volumes and the main text. Preparation for this process began in 1983, and editorial work started the following year under the administrative direction of Timothy J. Benbow, with John A. Simpson and Edmund S. C. Weiner as co-editors.[33] In 2016, Simpson published his memoir chronicling his years at the OED. See The Word Detective: Searching for the Meaning of It All at the Oxford English Dictionary ÿ A Memoir. Basic Books, New York.\\r\\nAnd so the New Oxford English Dictionary (NOED) project began. In the United States, more than 120 typists of the International Computaprint Corporation (now Reed Tech) started keying in over 350,000,000 characters, their work checked by 55 proof-readers in England.[33] Retyping the text alone was not sufficient; all the information represented by the complex typography of the original dictionary had to be retained, which was done by marking up the content in SGML.[33] A specialized search engine and display software were also needed to access it. Under a 1985 agreement, some of this software work was done at the University of Waterloo, Canada, at the Centre for the New Oxford English Dictionary, led by Frank Tompa and Gaston Gonnet; this search technology went on to become the basis for the Open Text Corporation.[34] Computer hardware, database and other software, development managers, and programmers for the project were donated by the British subsidiary of IBM; the colour syntax-directed editor for the project, LEXX, was written by Mike Cowlishaw of IBM.[35] The University of Waterloo, in Canada, volunteered to design the database. A. Walton Litz, an English professor at Princeton University who served on the Oxford University Press advisory council, was quoted in Time as saying \\"I've never been associated with a project, I've never even heard of a project, that was so incredibly complicated and that met every deadline.\\"[36]\\r\\nBy 1989, the NOED project had achieved its primary goals, and the editors, working online, had successfully combined the original text, Burchfield's supplement, and a small amount of newer material, into a single unified dictionary. The word \\"new\\" was again dropped from the name, and the second edition of the OED, or the OED2, was published. The first edition retronymically became the OED1.\\r\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary 2 was printed in 20 volumes.[1] For the first time, there was no attempt to start them on letter boundaries, and they were made roughly equal in size. The 20 volumes started with A, B.B.C., Cham, Creel, Dvandva, Follow, Hat, Interval, Look, Moul, Ow, Poise, Quemadero, Rob, Ser, Soot, Su, Thru, Unemancipated, and Wave.\\r\\nThe content of the OED2 is mostly just a reorganization of the earlier corpus, but the retypesetting provided an opportunity for two long-needed format changes. The headword of each entry was no longer capitalized, allowing the user to readily see those words that actually require a capital letter.[37] Murray had devised his own notation for pronunciation, there being no standard available at the time, whereas the OED2 adopted the modern International Phonetic Alphabet.[37][38] Unlike the earlier edition, all foreign alphabets except Greek were transliterated.[37]\\r\\nThe British quiz show Countdown has awarded the leather-bound complete version to the champions of each series since its inception in 1982.[39]\\r\\nWhen the print version of the second edition was published in 1989, the response was enthusiastic. Author Anthony Burgess declared it \\"the greatest publishing event of the century\\", as quoted by the Los Angeles Times.[40] Time dubbed the book \\"a scholarly Everest\\",[36] and Richard Boston, writing for The Guardian, called it \\"one of the wonders of the world\\".[41]\\r\\nThe supplements and their integration into the second edition were a great improvement to the OED as a whole, but it was recognized that most of the entries were still fundamentally unaltered from the first edition. Much of the information in the dictionary published in 1989 was already decades out of date, though the supplements had made good progress towards incorporating new vocabulary. Yet many definitions contained disproven scientific theories, outdated historical information, and moral values that were no longer widely accepted.[42][43] Furthermore, the supplements had failed to recognize many words in the existing volumes as obsolete by the time of the second edition's publication, meaning that thousands of words were marked as current despite no recent evidence of their use.[44]\\r\\nAccordingly, it was recognized that work on a third edition would have to begin to rectify these problems.[42] The first attempt to produce a new edition came with the Oxford English Dictionary Additions Series, a new set of supplements to complement the OED2 with the intention of producing a third edition from them.[45] The previous supplements appeared in alphabetical installments, whereas the new series had a full AÿZ range of entries within each individual volume, with a complete alphabetical index at the end of all words revised so far, each listed with the volume number which contained the revised entry.[45]\\r\\nHowever, in the end only three Additions volumes were published this way, two in 1993 and one in 1997,[46][47][48] each containing about 3,000 new definitions.[8] The possibilities of the World Wide Web and new computer technology in general meant that the processes of researching the dictionary and of publishing new and revised entries could be vastly improved. New text search databases offered vastly more material for the editors of the dictionary to work with, and with publication on the Web as a possibility, the editors could publish revised entries much more quickly and easily than ever before.[49] A new approach was called for, and for this reason it was decided to embark on a new, complete revision of the dictionary.\\r\\nBeginning with the launch of the first OED Online site in 2000, the editors of the dictionary began a major revision project to create a completely revised third edition of the dictionary (OED3), expected to be completed in 2037[50][51] at a projected cost of about S34 million.[52][1]\\r\\nRevisions were started at the letter M, with new material appearing every three months on the OED Online website. The editors chose to start the revision project from the middle of the dictionary in order that the overall quality of entries be made more even, since the later entries in the OED1 generally tended to be better than the earlier ones. However, in March 2008, the editors announced that they would alternate each quarter between moving forward in the alphabet as before and updating \\"key English words from across the alphabet, along with the other words which make up the alphabetical cluster surrounding them\\".[53] With the relaunch of the OED Online website in December 2010, alphabetical revision was abandoned altogether.[54]\\r\\nThe revision is expected to roughly double the dictionary in size.[5][55] Apart from general updates to include information on new words and other changes in the language, the third edition brings many other improvements, including changes in formatting and stylistic conventions to make entries clearer to read and enable more thorough searches to be made by computer, more thorough etymological information, and a general change of focus away from individual words towards more general coverage of the language as a whole.[49][56] While the original text drew its quotations mainly from literary sources such as novels, plays, and poetry, with additional material from newspapers and academic journals, the new edition will reference more kinds of material that were unavailable to the editors of previous editions, such as wills, inventories, account books, diaries, journals, and letters.[55]\\r\\nJohn Simpson was the first chief editor of the OED3. He retired in 2013 and was replaced by Michael Proffitt, who is the eighth chief editor of the dictionary.[57]\\r\\nThe production of the new edition takes full advantage of computer technology, particularly since the June 2005 inauguration of the whimsically named \\"Perfect All-Singing All-Dancing Editorial and Notation Application\\", or \\"Pasadena\\". With this XML-based system, the attention of lexicographers can be directed more to matters of content than to presentation issues such as the numbering of definitions. The new system has also simplified the use of the quotations database, and enabled staff in New York to work directly on the dictionary in the same way as their Oxford-based counterparts.[58]\\r\\nOther important computer uses include internet searches for evidence of current usage, and e-mail submissions of quotations by readers and the general public.[59]\\r\\nWordhunt was a 2005 appeal to the general public for help in providing citations for 50 selected recent words, and produced antedatings for many. The results were reported in a BBC TV series, Balderdash and Piffle. The OED's small army of devoted readers continue to contribute quotations: the department currently receives about 200,000 a year.[60]\\r\\nOED currently contains over 600,000 entries.[61]\\r\\nIn 1971, the 13-volume OED1 (1933) was reprinted as a two-volume Compact Edition, by photographically reducing each page to one-half its linear dimensions; each compact edition page held four OED1 pages in a four-up (\\"4-up\\") format. The two volume letters were A and P; the first supplement was at the second volume's end. The Compact Edition included, in a small slip-case drawer, a magnifying glass to help in reading reduced type. Many copies were inexpensively distributed through book clubs. In 1987, the second supplement was published as a third volume to the Compact Edition.\\r\\nIn 1991, for the 20-volume OED2 (1989), the compact edition format was re-sized to one-third of original linear dimensions, a nine-up (\\"9-up\\") format requiring greater magnification, but allowing publication of a single-volume dictionary. It was accompanied by a magnifying glass as before and A User's Guide to the \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\", by Donna Lee Berg.[62] After these volumes were published, though, book club offers commonly continued to sell the two-volume 1971 Compact Edition.[26]\\r\\nOnce the text of the dictionary was digitized and online, it was also available to be published on CD-ROM. The text of the first edition was made available in 1987.[63] Afterward, three versions of the second edition were issued. Version 1 (1992) was identical in content to the printed second edition, and the CD itself was not copy-protected. Version 2 (1999) included the Oxford English Dictionary Additions of 1993 and 1997.\\r\\nVersion 3.0 was released in 2002 with additional words from the OED3 and software improvements. Version 3.1.1 (2007) added support for hard disk installation, so that the user does not have to insert the CD to use the dictionary. It has been reported that this version will work on operating systems other than Microsoft Windows, using emulation programs.[64][65] Version 4.0 of the CD has been available since June 2009 and works with Windows 7 and Mac OS X (10.4 or later).[66] This version uses the CD drive for installation, running only from the hard drive.\\r\\nOn 14 March 2000, the Oxford English Dictionary Online (OED Online) became available to subscribers.[67] The online database contains the entire OED2 and is updated quarterly with revisions that will be included in the OED3 (see above). The online edition is the most up-to-date version of the dictionary available. The OED web site is not optimized for mobile devices, but the developers have stated that there are plans to provide an API that would enable developers to develop different interfaces for querying the OED.[68]\\r\\nThe price for an individual to use this edition is S195 or US$295 every year, even after a reduction in 2004; consequently, most subscribers are large organizations such as universities. Some public libraries and companies have subscribed, as well, including public libraries in the United Kingdom, where access is funded by the Arts Council,[69] and public libraries in New Zealand.[70][71] Individuals who belong to a library which subscribes to the service are able to use the service from their own home without charge.\\r\\nThe OED's utility and renown as a historical dictionary have led to numerous offspring projects and other dictionaries bearing the Oxford name, though not all are directly related to the OED itself.\\r\\nThe Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, originally started in 1902 and completed in 1933,[73] is an abridgement of the full work that retains the historical focus, but does not include any words which were obsolete before 1700 except those used by Shakespeare, Milton, Spenser, and the King James Bible.[74] A completely new edition was produced from the OED2 and published in 1993,[75] with further revisions following in 2002 and 2007.\\r\\nThe Concise Oxford Dictionary is a different work, which aims to cover current English only, without the historical focus. The original edition, mostly based on the OED1, was edited by Francis George Fowler and Henry Watson Fowler and published in 1911, before the main work was completed.[76] Revised editions appeared throughout the twentieth century to keep it up to date with changes in English usage.\\r\\nThe Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English was originally conceived by F. G. Fowler and H. W. Fowler to be compressed, compact, and concise. Its primary source is the Oxford English Dictionary, and it is nominally an abridgment of the Concise Oxford Dictionary. It was first published in 1924.[77]\\r\\nIn 1998 the New Oxford Dictionary of English (NODE) was published. While also aiming to cover current English, NODE was not based on the OED. Instead, it was an entirely new dictionary produced with the aid of corpus linguistics.[78] Once NODE was published, a similarly brand-new edition of the Concise Oxford Dictionary followed, this time based on an abridgement of NODE rather than the OED; NODE (under the new title of the Oxford Dictionary of English, or ODE) continues to be principal source for Oxford's product line of current-English dictionaries, including the New Oxford American Dictionary, with the OED now only serving as the basis for scholarly historical dictionaries.\\r\\nThe OED lists British headword spellings (e.g., labour, centre) with variants following (labor, center, etc.). For the suffix more commonly spelt -ise in British English, OUP policy dictates a preference for the spelling -ize, e.g., realize vs. realise and globalization vs. globalisation. The rationale is etymological, in that the English suffix is mainly derived from the Greek suffix -, (-izein), or the Latin -izre.[79] However, -ze is also sometimes treated as an Americanism insofar as the -ze suffix has crept into words where it did not originally belong, as with analyse (British English), which is spelt analyze in American English.[80][81]\\r\\nDespite, and at the same time precisely because of, its claim of authority[82] on the English language, the Oxford English Dictionary has been criticised since at least the 1960s from various angles. It has become a target precisely because of its scope, its claims to authority, its British-centredness and relative neglect of World Englishes,[83] its implied but not acknowledged focus on literary language and, above all, its influence. The OED, as a commercial product, has always had to manoeuvre a thin line between PR, marketing and scholarship and one can argue that its biggest problem is the critical uptake of the work by the interested public. In his review of the 1982 supplement,[84] University of Oxford linguist Roy Harris writes that criticizing the OED is extremely difficult because \\"one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution\\", one that \\"has become, like the English monarchy, virtually immune from criticism in principle\\". He further notes that neologisms from respected \\"literary\\" authors such as Samuel Beckett and Virginia Woolf are included, whereas usage of words in newspapers or other less \\"respectable\\" sources hold less sway, even though they may be commonly used. He writes that the OED's \\"[b]lack-and-white lexicography is also black-and-white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage\\", faulting the dictionary's prescriptive rather than descriptive usage. To Harris, this prescriptive classification of certain usages as \\"erroneous\\" and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the \\"social bias[es]\\" of the (presumably well-educated and wealthy) compilers. However, the identification of \\"erroneous and catachrestic\\" usages is being removed from third edition entries,[85][86] sometimes in favour of usage notes describing the attitudes to language which have previously led to these classifications.[87]\\r\\nHarris also faults the editors' \\"donnish conservatism\\" and their adherence to prudish Victorian morals, citing as an example the non-inclusion of \\"various centuries-old 'four-letter words'\\" until 1972. However, no English dictionary included such words, for fear of possible prosecution under British obscenity laws, until after the conclusion of the Lady Chatterley's Lover obscenity trial in 1960. The first dictionary to include the word fuck was the Penguin English Dictionary of 1965.[88] Joseph Wright's English Dialect Dictionary had included shit in 1905.[89]\\r\\nThe OED's claims of authority have also been questioned by linguists such as Pius ten Hacken, who notes that the dictionary actively strives towards definitiveness and authority but can only achieve those goals in a limited sense, given the difficulties of defining the scope of what it includes.[90]\\r\\nFounding editor James Murray was also reluctant to include scientific terms, despite their documentation, unless he felt that they were widely enough used. In 1902, he declined to add the word \\"radium\\" to the dictionary.[91][92]\\r\\nIn contrast, Tim Bray, co-creator of Extensible Markup Language (XML), credits the OED as the developing inspiration of that markup language.[93] Similarly, author Anu Garg, founder of Wordsmith.org, has called the Oxford English Dictionary a \\"lex icon\\".[94]","input":"What is the latest edition of the oxford english dictionary?"},{"output":"priests (or, in the first year, transitional deacons) who are in their first post after ordination (usually for four years), and are completing their training (not unlike an apprenticeship)","context":"A curate (/?kju?r?t/ KEW-rit) is a person who is invested with the care or cure (cura) of souls of a parish. In this sense, \\"curate\\" correctly means a parish priest; but in English-speaking countries the term curate is commonly used to describe clergy who are assistants to the parish priest. The duties or office of a curate are called a curacy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term is derived from the Latin curatus (compare Curator).\\r\\nIn other languages, derivations from curatus may be used differently. In French, the cur is the chief priest of a parish,[1] as is the Italian curato, the Spanish cura, and the Filipino term kura proko (which almost always refers to the parish priest), which is derived from Spanish.\\r\\nIn the Catholic Church, the English word \\"curate\\" is used for a priest assigned to a parish in a position subordinate to that of the parish priest. The parish priest (or in the United States the \\"pastor\\") is the priest who has canonical responsibility for the parish. He may be assisted by one or more other priests, referred to as curates, assistant priests,[2] parochial vicars[3] or (in America) \\"associate/assistant pastors\\".\\r\\nIn the Church of England today, \\"curate\\" refers to priests (or, in the first year, transitional deacons) who are in their first post after ordination (usually for four years), and are completing their training (not unlike an apprenticeship). The technical term \\"curate\\", as found in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, meant the incumbent of a benefice, that is the person licensed by the diocesan bishop to the \\"cure of souls\\", who, depending on how the benefice income was raised and distributed, was either a rector, a vicar, or a perpetual curate.[4]\\r\\nAlthough the expression \\"curate-in-charge\\" was mainly used of an informal arrangement whereby an incumbent gave substantial responsibility for one of the churches within the parish to an assistant, in law it denoted a cleric licensed by the bishop to exercise some or all of the cure of souls when the incumbent had failed to make adequate provision for them or was subject to disciplinary measures.[5] Once in possession of their benefices, rectors and vicars enjoyed a freehold, and could only be removed after due legal process, and for a restricted number of reasons.[6]\\r\\nPerpetual curates were placed on a similar footing in 1838 and were commonly styled \\"vicars\\", and this practice was legally recognised in 1868.[7] Clergy (both transitional deacons and priests) who assist the \\"curate\\" were, and are, properly called assistant curates, but are often referred to as \\"the curate\\".\\r\\nA house provided for an assistant curate is sometimes colloquially called a \\"curatage\\". Assistant curates are also licensed by the bishop, but only at the request of the \\"curate\\", who had the right of dismissal subject to certain conditions.[8] Although it is customary for a priest to serve as a curate in one or more parishes before becoming an incumbent, it is by no means unknown for priests who have previously been beneficed or consecrated bishop to return to a curacy (as assistant curate), sometimes as a matter of choice. For example, Geoffrey Francis Fisher served as Curate of Trent near Sherborne after retiring as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1961.[9]\\r\\nWith the 1968 Pastoral Measure and subsequent legislation, the Church of England has undergone a major process of reform which still continues today, and much of above no longer holds good. Ministers in the Church of England whose main financial income comes from sources other than their work as clergy may be termed \\"Self Supporting Ministers\\" or \\"Curate (SSM)\\".[10]\\r\\nTerms like \\"rector\\" and \\"curate\\" were carried overseas with the spread of Anglicanism, but their exact meaning depends on local conditions and regulations. In the Church of Ireland some curates are styled \\"bishop's curates\\" as they are accountable directly to the diocesan bishop, while sometimes mentored by local parish clergy, and are perceived to have more autonomy than other assistant curates.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Anglican parishes with a Charismatic or evangelical (low church) tradition, the roles of curates are usually seen as being an assistant leader to the overall leader, often in a larger team of pastoral leaders. Many of the larger Charismatic and Evangelical parishes have larger ministry teams with a number of pastoral leaders, some ordained and others who are not.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the Episcopal Church of the United States, the curacy may be a temporary place to continue training after ordination, similar to an internship,[11] or it may be a permanent, subordinant position, more akin to a perpetual curate.\\r\\nOriginally a bishop would entrust a priest with the \\"cure of souls\\" (pastoral ministry) of a parish. When, in medieval Europe, this included the legal freehold of church land in the parish, the parish priest was a \\"perpetual curate\\" (curatus perpetuus), an assistant would be a (plain) curate (curatus temporalis).\\r\\nThe words perpetuus and temporalis distinguish their appointments but not the length of service, the apparent reference to time is accidental. A curate is appointed by the parish priest and paid from parish funds. A perpetual curate is a priest in charge of a parish who was (usually) appointed and paid by the bishop.\\r\\nAs the church became more embedded into the fabric of feudal Europe, various other titles often supplanted \\"curate\\" for the parish priest. \\"Rector\\" was the title given to a priest in possession of the tithe income. This right to the income was known as a \\"living\\".

It is the highest gallantry award for civilians of any rank or profession, and is primarily intended to be a civil award. Military personnel may be awarded the George Cross for actions not in the face of the enemy or for actions not normally meriting a purely military award.[1] The George Cross was officially constituted on 24 September 1940 by King George VI as a way to recognise civilian courage. It recognises \\"acts of the greatest heroism or of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme danger\\".[1]\\r\\nInitially, the Empire Gallantry Medal recognised acts of the highest bravery. The George Cross succeeded the Empire Gallantry Medal and all those living that had been awarded the medal, and all posthumous awards from the outbreak of World War II, were obliged to exchange their medal for the George Cross. In 1971, the living recipients of the Albert Medal and Edward Medal were invited to exchange their medals for the George Cross; 24 recipients elected not to exchange their medal.\\r\\nIn recent years, the George Cross has often served as the highest-level military decoration for recognition of peacetime heroism, or for wartime actions of gallantry not in the face of the enemy. Prior to 2017, when Dominic Troulan received the decoration for heroism during a 2013 terrorist attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya, no civilian awards of the GC had been made since 1978, when it was awarded to Victoria Police constable Michael Pratt. Previously, the last civilian award in the UK to a living recipient had been to Metropolitan Police inspector Jim Beaton in 1974 for his efforts in protecting Anne, Princess Royal from a mentally ill man attempting to kidnap her.\\r\\nCertain Commonwealth realms have replaced the GC with their own equivalent awards. The Cross of Valour has been awarded to Canadian citizens since its establishment in 1972,[2] and the identically named Cross of Valour has been awarded to Australian citizens since 1975.[3] Both allow the wearer to use the postnominal letters CV.[2][3] Since 1999, the New Zealand Cross has been awarded to New Zealand citizens, which allows the wearer the postnominal NZC.[4] Awards of the George Cross made prior to the establishment of their replacements in each nation are not exchanged.\\r\\nUntil 26 January 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth, the George Cross and its precursors were awarded to Indian civilians and military personnel in the government and princely states forces.[1] All British awards were discontinued after 26 January 1950. In 1952, the Ashoka Chakra replaced the George Cross.[5]\\r\\n[8] [9] [10]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecipients who died within the last five years are listed below.","input":"What is the highest civilian award in uk?"},{"output":"A simple majority","context":"The appointment and confirmation of Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States involves several steps set forth by the United States Constitution, which have been further refined and developed by decades of tradition. Candidates are nominated by the President of the United States and must face a series of hearings in which both the nominee and other witnesses make statements and answer questions before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which can vote to send the nomination to the full United States Senate. Confirmation by the Senate allows the President to formally appoint the candidate to the court.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution requires the President of the United States to nominate Supreme Court Justices and, with Senate confirmation, requires Justices to be appointed. This was for the division of power between the President and Senate by the founders, who wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nhe shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint ... Judges of the supreme Court...\\r\\nUpon the election of a new President, incoming White House staff prepare profiles of possible candidates for the Supreme Court, considering not only judges but also politicians and other individuals whom they consider appropriate for the role. Besides considering national figures whose views are well-known, they consider others who are less recognized. They go through published rulings, articles, speeches, and other background material to get an idea of candidates' values and views on constitutional issues. Age, health, race, gender, education, and likelihood of confirmation are also factored into considerations. Once a Supreme Court vacancy opens, the President discusses the candidates with advisors. Senators also call the President with suggestions. In turn, the White House lobbies key senators for their votes. After a first choice is decided, the candidate is contacted and called on by the President to serve on the highest court. Staffers send a vetting form for the candidate to fill out. They visit the candidate to go over tax records and payments to domestic help. A formal FBI background check is conducted. Candidates whom the President has never met are interviewed by White House officials before being sent to the White House to be interviewed in person by the President. After making a final decision, the President calls the candidate, who is told to prepare a statement for an appearance in front of the national press for the President's formal announcement. The nominee then meets with senators and prepares for confirmation hearings.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological views.[1] In many cases, however, a Justice's decisions may be contrary to what the nominating President anticipated. A famous instance was Chief Justice Earl Warren; President Dwight D. Eisenhower expected him to be a conservative judge, but his decisions are arguably among the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later called the appointment \\"the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made\\".[2]  Another Justice whose decisions ran contrary to what was believed to be his ideology was David Souter, who was nominated to the high court in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush.  Many pundits and politicians at the time expected Souter to be a conservative; however, after becoming a Justice, his opinions generally fell on the liberal side of the political spectrum.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the Constitution does not set any qualifications for service as a Justice, the President may nominate any individual to serve on the Court. However, that person must receive the confirmation of the Senate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modern times, the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from special-interest groups, many of which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee, depending on whether the nominee's track record aligns with the group's views.[citation needed] The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings, questioning nominees to determine their suitability. By convention, nominees avoid revealing too much about their views on potential cases that may come before the Court.[citation needed] At the close of confirmation hearings, the Committee votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent, beginning with Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925. Some western senators were concerned with his links to Wall Street and expressed their opposition when Stone was nominated. Stone proposed what was then the novelty of appearing before the Judiciary Committee to answer questions; his testimony helped secure a confirmation vote with very little opposition. The second nominee to appear before the Committee was Felix Frankfurter, who only addressed (at the Committee's request) what he considered to be slanderous allegations against him.[3] The modern practice of the Committee questioning nominees on their judicial views began with the nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in 1955; the nomination came shortly after the Court handed down the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, and several Southern senators attempted to block Harlan's confirmation, hence the decision to testify.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the Committee reports out the nomination, the whole Senate considers it. A simple majority vote is required to confirm or to reject a nominee. Prior to 2017, a successful filibuster threat could add the requirement of a supermajority of 60 needed in favor of cloture, which would allow debate to end and force a final vote on confirmation. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees in its history. The most recent rejection of a nominee by vote of the full Senate came in 1987, when the Senate refused to confirm Robert Bork.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot everyone nominated by the President has received a floor vote in the Senate. Prior to 2017 a nominee could be filibustered once debate on the nomination had begun in the full Senate. A filibuster indefinitely prolongs the debate, preventing a final vote on the nominee. President Lyndon Johnson's nomination of sitting Associate Justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with Fortas's ethics. President Donald Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the seat left vacant by Antonin Scalia's death was the second. Unlike the Fortas filibuster, however, only Democratic Senators voted against cloture on the Gorsuch nomination, citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy, and the Republican majority's prior refusal to take up Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy.[6][7][8] This led the Republican majority to change the rules[9] and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot every Supreme Court nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate. A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs, typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee; this occurred most recently with the nomination of Harriet Miers in 2006 before Committee hearings had begun, citing concerns about Senate requests during her confirmation process for access to internal Executive Branch documents resulting from her position as White House Counsel. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan withdrew the nomination of Douglas H. Ginsburg because of news reports containing marijuana use allegations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Senate may also fail to act on the nomination, which expires at the end of the session. For example, President Dwight Eisenhower's first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November 1954 was not acted on by the Senate; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955, and Harlan was confirmed two months later. Most recently, the Senate failed to act on President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in March 2016 to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia; the nomination expired in January 2017, and the vacancy was later filled by President Donald J. Trump's appointment of Neil Gorsuch.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore 1981 the approval process of Justices was usually rapid. From the Truman through Nixon administrations, Justices were typically approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the present, however, the process has taken much longer. According to the Congressional Research Service, the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days (2.2 months), while the median is 71 days (or 2.3 months).[12][13] Some believe this is because Congress sees Justices as playing a more political role than in the past.[14] The perceived politicization of the process has drawn criticism. For example, columnist George F. Will termed the defeat of Robert Bork's nomination \\"unjust\\" and, more generally, that the nomination process does \\"not delve deeply into the nominee's jurisprudential thinking.\\"[15] Supreme Court nominations have caused media speculation about whether the judge leans to the left, middle, or right.[16] One indication of the politicized selection process is how much time each nominee spends being questioned under the glare of media coverage; before 1925, nominees were never questioned;[17] after 1955, every nominee has been required to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and answer questions; and the hours spent being grilled have lengthened from single digits (before 1980) to double digits today.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing is a table of the approximate number of hours that media sources estimate were spent on the questioning of Supreme Court nominees since 1925:\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the Senate confirms the nomination by an affirmative vote, the Secretary of the Senate attests to a resolution of confirmation and transmits it to the White House.[19]  The President then prepares and signs a commission, and causes the Seal of the United States Department of Justice to be affixed to the document before the new Justice can take office.[20] The date of commission determines a Justice's seniority.[21] A ceremony is held in which the Justice must take the Constitutional Oath, which is used for every federal and state officeholder below the President, and the Judicial Oath used for federal judges before entering into the execution of their office.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution provides that:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\\r\\nThus, when the Senate is in recess, the President may make a temporary appointment to any office requiring Senate approval, including filling vacancies on the Supreme Court, without the Senate's advice and consent. Such a recess appointee to the Supreme Court holds office only until the end of the next Senate session (always less than two years). To continue to serve thereafter and be compensated for his or her service, the nominee must be formally nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Of the ten Justices who have received recess appointments - two Chief Justices and eight Associate Justices - only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed for a regular appointment. No president since Dwight Eisenhower (who made three such appointments) has made a recess appointment to the Supreme Court and the practice has become highly controversial even when applied to lower federal courts. During the 110th Congress, the Democratic leadership of the Senate specifically blocked Republican President George W. Bush from making any recess appointments with the use of pro forma sessions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960 the Senate passed a resolution stating that it was the sense of the Senate that recess appointments to the Supreme Court should not be made except under unusual circumstances.[22] Being a resolution, it has no legally binding effect, but was intended as an expression of the position of the Senate and as a guide to executive actions. The resolution passed by a vote of 48 to 37, mainly along party lines.[22]\\r\\n[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing is a list of recess appointments that have been made to the Supreme Court:[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ability of a president to appoint new justices depends on the occurrence of a vacancy on the Court.  In practice, such vacancies normally occur as the result of an incumbent justices' death, resignation, or retirement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution provides that justices \\"shall hold their offices during good behavior\\", which is understood to mean that confirmed justices may serve for the remainder of their lives, until death.  Justices may also resign or retire from their offices, and any of these circumstances results in a vacancy which must be filled.  Because justices have indefinite tenure, the timing of future vacancies is unpredictable.  Sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession: in September 1971, associate justices Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II both retired, producing two vacancies which were filled in January 1972 by Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist, respectively.  On the other hand, sometimes several years pass between consecutive vacancies.  In August 1994, Harry Blackmun's retirement created a vacancy which was filled by Stephen Breyer.  No further vacancy would occur on the Court until September 2005 when Rehnquist, since promoted to chief justice, died.  This vacancy was filled by current chief justice John Roberts.\\r\\n\\r\\nLess commonly, though with historical precedent, vacancies may occur as a result of Congress changing the size of the Court.  Because the Constitution does not specify the Court's size, it was left to Congress to determine the matter through law, and a small number of statutes have legally changed the size of the Court throughout its history.  Changing the Court's size can have the effect of changing the seats on the Court; a newly created seat brings with it a vacancy which must be filled by an initial officeholder.  The original Judiciary Act of 1789 called for six justices, vacancies promptly filled by the appointments of George Washington, resulting in the Court's first complete composition.  An 1801 act called for the Court to be reduced to five justices upon its next vacancy, but was swiftly obviated by an 1802 act which restored the Court's legal size to six before any such vacancy occurred.  In 1807, the Court's size was increased to seven, creating one new vacancy filled by Thomas Todd.  Again in 1837, the Court's size was increased to nine, the two new vacancies being filled by John Catron and John McKinley.  An 1863 act increased the Court's size to ten, the vacancy being filled by Stephen Johnson Field.  Although an 1866 act provided that the Court's size would be thinned from ten to seven through attrition (and which did result in the elimination of two seats while in effect), a final 1869 act[25] interrupted the plan set forth in 1866: the Court's size shall be nine, the legally prescribed full strength which has stood ever since.  Consequently, one final seat was created and filled by Joseph Bradley.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the Court in 1937, seeking to appoint an additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70?years and 6?months and refused retirement; under Roosevelt's proposal, such appointments would continue until the Court reached a maximum size of 15 justices. Ostensibly, the proposal was made to ease the burdens of the docket on the elderly justices, but Roosevelt's actual purpose was to pack the Court with justices who would support New Deal policies and legislation.[26] This plan, usually called the \\"Court-packing Plan\\", failed in Congress and proved a political disaster for Roosevelt.[27] The balance of the Court shifted with the retirement of Willis Van Devanter and the confirmation of Hugo Black in August 1937. By the end of 1941, Roosevelt had appointed seven Supreme Court justices and elevated Harlan Fiske Stone to chief justice.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is constitutionally possible for a justice to be removed from office through Congressional impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate, another possible situation creating a vacancy.  Only one justiceSamuel Chase, late 1804-early 1805has ever been impeached; however, Chase was acquitted by the Senate, and thus not removed from office.  Removal of a justice through an impeachment process has therefore never taken place.  Less substantial efforts towards impeachment of a sitting justice, not reaching a House vote, have occurred more recently: William O. Douglas was twice the subject of hearings, first in 1953 and again in 1970.  No mechanism presently exists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury, both unable to resign and unable to resume service.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the unpredictability of vacancies, most presidents have successfully appointed at least one justice. The four exceptions are William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Andrew Johnson, and Jimmy Carter. Harrison died a month after taking office, though his successor John Tyler made an appointment during that presidential term. Taylor likewise died early in his term, although his successor Millard Fillmore also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Johnson was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by the 1866 act which reduced the Court's size, mentioned above.  Jimmy Carter is the only president who completed one full term in office without making a nomination to the Court during his presidency.","input":"How many senate votes to confirm supreme court nominee?"},{"output":"in 1982","context":"The International Day of Peace, sometimes unofficially known as World Peace Day, is a United Nations-sanctioned holiday observed annually on 21 September. It is dedicated to world peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, such as might be occasioned by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone for humanitarian aid access. The day was first celebrated in 1982, and is kept by many nations, political groups, military groups, and people. In 2013 the day was dedicated by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to peace education, the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably.[1]\\r\\nTo inaugurate the day, the United Nations Peace Bell is rung at UN Headquarters (in New York City). The bell is cast from coins donated by children from all continents except Africa, and was a gift from the United Nations Association of Japan, as \\"a reminder of the human cost of war\\"; the inscription on its side reads, \\"Long live absolute world peace\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations General Assembly declared, in a resolution sponsored by the United Kingdom and Costa Rica,[3] the International Day of Peace, to be devoted to commemorating and strengthening the ideals of peace.[4] The date initially chosen was the regular opening day of the annual sessions of the General Assembly, the third Tuesday of September. (This was changed in 2001 to the current annual celebration on 21 September each year? see 2001 below.)\\r\\nTuesday 21 September 1982 was the first occurrence of the International Day of Peace.

A new resolution was passed by the General Assembly,[3] sponsored by the United Kingdom (giving credit to Peace One Day) and Costa Rica (the original sponsors of the day), to give the International Day of Peace a fixed calendar date, 21 September, and declare it also as a day of global ceasefire and non-violence.[8]\\r\\nA diplomatic stir occurred when Lions Clubs International sponsored a competition for six posters to be used for International Day of Peace commemorative stamps issued by the UN Postal Administration. A poster by 15-year-old Taiwanese school student Yang Chih-Yuan was announced as one of the winners, but the announcement was withdrawn. Taiwan media reports, Taiwan Lions Club and the government of Taiwan claimed the decision not to use the poster resulted from pressure from China;[9] the rejection of the student's painting on political grounds did not reflect the ideals of the International Day of Peace.[10] The UN issued a statement that, although in the short list of eight designs, \\"due to an internal misunderstanding and miscommunication, Mr. Yang's proof got publicized in error as one of the six stamps intended to be issued.\\"[9] The government of Taiwan (Republic of China) later issued a stamp containing the image.[11]\\r\\nIn 2005, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for the worldwide observance of a 22-hour cease-fire and day of nonviolence to mark the Day.[12]\\r\\nThe Culture of Peace Initiative published an annual report for the International Day of Peace in 2005 describing events in 46 countries:[13] Africa 11; East Asia and Pacific 12; Latin America and Caribbean 4; Europe 14; Middle East 3; North America 2 (22 states, provinces).\\r\\nIn 2006, then Secretary-General Kofi Annan rang the Peace Bell for the last time during his Term in office.

Non-residents who may legally possess firearms in their home state are exempt from this requirement.\\r\\nThe state police issue licenses for the concealed carry of handguns to qualified applicants age 21 or older who pass a 16-hour training course. However, any law enforcement agency can object to an individual being granted a license \\"based upon a reasonable suspicion that the applicant is a danger to himself or herself or others, or a threat to public safety\\". Objections are considered by a Concealed Carry Licensing Review Board, which decides whether or not the license will be issued, based on \\"a preponderance of the evidence\\". Licenses issued by other states are not recognized, except for carry in a vehicle. Open carry is prohibited in most areas. When a firearm is being transported by a person without a concealed carry license, it must be unloaded and enclosed in a case, or broken down in a non-functioning state, or not immediately accessible.\\r\\nThere is a waiting period to take possession after purchasing a firearm  72 hours for a handgun, or 24 hours for a rifle or shotgun. For private sales, the seller must verify the buyer's FOID card, and keep a record of the sale for at least 10 years. Lost or stolen guns must be reported to the police. Possession of automatic firearms, short-barreled shotguns, or suppressors is prohibited. Possession of short-barreled rifles is permitted only for those who have an ATF Curios and Relics license or are a member of a military reenactment group. The state does not restrict the sale or possession of firearms that have been defined as assault weapons, or of magazines that can hold more than a certain number of rounds of ammunition, but some local jurisdictions do restrict them.\\r\\nIllinois has state preemption for certain areas of gun law, which overrides the home rule guideline in those cases. Some local governments have enacted ordinances that are more restrictive than those of the state in areas not covered by state preemption.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo legally possess or purchase firearms or ammunition, Illinois residents must have a Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) card, which is issued by the Illinois State Police.[4] The police must issue FOID cards to eligible applicants. An applicant is disqualified if he or she has been convicted of a felony or an act of domestic violence, is the subject of an order of protection, has been convicted of assault or battery or been a patient in a mental institution within the last five years, has been adjudicated as a mental defective, or is an illegal immigrant.[5] Applicants under the age of 21 must have the written consent of a parent or legal guardian who is also legally able to possess firearms.[6]\\r\\nWhen a firearm is sold or transferred, the buyer is required to present their FOID card. This applies to private sales between individuals as well as to sales by Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders.[7] For firearm sales by an FFL holder, or at a gun show, the seller must perform an automated dial-up check with the State Police, to verify that the FOID card is valid, and to redo the background check of the buyer.[4] This additional checking is known as the Firearm Transfer Inquiry Program (FTIP).[8] For private sales not at a gun show, the seller must also verify the buyer's FOID card with the state police, and receive a transfer approval number, either via a web site or with a phone call.[9][10][11][12][13]\\r\\nThe buyer is also required to present their FOID card when purchasing ammunition.[14]\\r\\nIn 2011, in the case of People v. Holmes, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that non-Illinois residents who are permitted to possess a firearm in their home state are not required to have an Illinois FOID card.[15][16] Non-Illinois residents do not qualify to obtain a FOID card, but the FOID statute does make provisions for applicants who are employed in Illinois as law enforcement officers, armed security officers, or by the U.S. military.[4]\\r\\nA FOID card does not authorize the carrying of a concealed firearm,[17] but having a FOID card is a prerequisite for obtaining a concealed carry license.[18]\\r\\nThe Illinois State Police Department issues licenses for the concealed carry of handguns to qualified applicants age 21 or older who pass a 16-hour training course. Illinois law says that the state police \\"shall issue\\" a license to a qualified applicant. However, any law enforcement agency can object to an individual being granted a license \\"based upon a reasonable suspicion that the applicant is a danger to himself or herself or others, or a threat to public safety\\". Objections are considered by a Concealed Carry Licensing Review Board, which decides whether or not the license will be issued, based on \\"a preponderance of the evidence\\".[18][19][20] Under revised rules implemented in July 2014, the Review Board notifies the applicant by mail of the basis of the objection and identifies the agency that brought it.[21]\\r\\nIn order to apply for a license the applicant must have in their possession the certificate from the required training, a valid drivers license or state ID card, a valid FOID card, a head and shoulder electronic photograph taken in the last 30 days, ten years of documented residency, fingerprints (optional, but submitting an application without prints increases the potential processing time from 90 to 120 days),[22] and the application fee.[23]\\r\\nPermits cost $150 for residents or $300 for non-residents, and are valid for five years. An Illinois resident is defined as someone who qualifies for an Illinois driver's license or state identification card due to establishment of a primary domicile in Illinois.[24] A non-resident is someone who has not resided in Illinois for more than 30 days and resides in another state or territory.[18]\\r\\nNon-residents may apply if their state is on a list of states with laws related to firearm ownership, possession, and carrying, that are \\"substantially similar\\" to the requirements to obtain a carry license in Illinois. A non-resident applicant must also possess a carry license or permit from his or her state of residence, if applicable. Prior to February 2017, the Illinois State Police considered only Hawaii, New Mexico, South Carolina, and Virginia to qualify as substantially similar.[25] In February 2017, the list of substantially similar states changed to Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia.[26] Illinois concealed carry licensees from the three states removed from the list of approved states received letters stating that their Illinois licenses were no longer valid.[27]\\r\\nConcealed carry permits or licenses issued by other states are not recognized, except that non-residents in possession of a carry permit or license from their home state may carry in a vehicle while traveling through Illinois.[18][19]\\r\\nConcealed carry is prohibited on public transportation, at a bar or restaurant that gets more than half its revenue from the sale of alcohol, at a public gathering or special event that requires a permit (e.g. a street fair or festival), at a place where alcohol is sold for special events, and on private property where the owner has chosen not to allow it (and, unless the property is a private residence, has posted an appropriate sign). Concealed carry is also not allowed at any school, college or university, preschool or daycare facility, government building, courthouse, prison, jail, detention facility, hospital, playground, park, Cook County Forest Preserve area, stadium or arena for college or professional sports, amusement park, riverboat casino, off-track betting facility, library, zoo, museum, airport, nuclear facility, or place where firearms are prohibited under federal law. However, concealed carry license holders who are in the parking lot of a prohibited location (except a nuclear facility) are allowed to carry a concealed firearm when they are in their vehicle, and to store their gun locked in their vehicle and out of plain view.[18][19] On February 1, 2018, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the state's ban on possession of a firearm within 1,000 feet of a public park was unconstitutional.[28]\\r\\nWhen a license holder is carrying a concealed handgun, and is asked by a police officer if they are carrying, there is a duty to inform the officer that they are. This can be done with a verbal reply, or by showing their concealed handgun license.[29]\\r\\nIn accordance with federal law, persons who have been convicted of a felony, or of a misdemeanor act of domestic violence, are ineligible to receive a concealed carry license. In Illinois persons who, within the last five years, have been convicted of a misdemeanor involving the use of force or violence, or received two convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or been in residential or court-ordered treatment for substance abuse, are also ineligible to receive a license.[30] There are other conditions that make an applicant ineligible under state law, including having been a patient in a mental health facility in the last five years.[18]\\r\\nIn compliance with the federal Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, off-duty and retired police officers who qualify annually under state guidelines are allowed to carry concealed.[31]\\r\\nOpen carry of firearms is generally illegal, except when hunting, or in a fixed place of business with the owner's permission, or in one's abode.[32]\\r\\nWhen a firearm is being transported it must be (a) unloaded and enclosed in a case, firearm carrying box, shipping box, or other container, or (b) broken down in a non-functioning state, or (c) not immediately accessible, or (d) carried or possessed in accordance with the Firearm Concealed Carry Act by a person with a valid concealed carry license.[33]\\r\\nIllinois was the last state to pass a law to allow the concealed carry of firearms by citizens.[34][35] The state's original handgun carry ban was enacted in 1949, with the ban's most recent revision being enacted in 1962.[36] The pre-existing law forbade concealed carry, and generally prohibited open carry, except in counties that had enacted ordinances allowing open carry. On December 11, 2012, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in the case of Moore v. Madigan, ruled that Illinois' concealed carry ban was unconstitutional, and gave the state 180 days to change its laws.[37] Subsequently, the court granted a 30-day extension of the deadline.[38] On July 9, 2013, Illinois enacted the Firearm Concealed Carry Act, which established a system for the issuing of concealed carry licenses.[39][40] On September 12, 2013, the Illinois Supreme Court, in the case of People v. Aguilar, also ruled that the state's Aggravated Unlawful Use of a Weapon law, which completely prohibited concealed carry, was unconstitutional.[41] On January 5, 2014, the state police began accepting applications for licenses to carry concealed handguns.[42] On February 28, 2014, the state police announced that they had begun issuing concealed carry licenses.[43]\\r\\nArticle 1 section 22 of the Illinois Constitution states, \\"Subject only to the police power, the right of the individual citizen to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\\"[44]\\r\\nWhen purchasing a handgun in Illinois there is a 72-hour waiting period after the sale before the buyer can take possession. The waiting period for a rifle or shotgun is 24 hours.[33]\\r\\nWhen a firearm is sold by a licensed dealer, the seller is required to provide a gun lock, unless the firearm itself includes an integrated locking mechanism.[45]\\r\\nFor private sales, the seller is required to keep a record of the transfer for at least 10 years.[7]\\r\\nLost or stolen guns must be reported to the police within 72 hours.[9][46]\\r\\nA gun owner can be charged with a crime if a minor under the age of 14 gains access to their firearm when it is unsecured (i.e. not locked in a box or secured with a trigger lock) and causes death or great bodily harm.[47]\\r\\nRegarding Title II weapons, the possession of automatic firearms (such as machine guns), short-barreled shotguns, and suppressors is prohibited.[33] Possession of short-barreled rifles is allowed for ATF Curios and Relics license holders, or, if the rifle is historically accurate has an overall length of at least 26 inches, for members of a bona fide military reenactment group.[48] While possession of a large-bore destructive device itself is not prohibited, possession of an artillery projectile, shell or grenade with over 1/4 ounce of explosive is prohibited.[33] There is no prohibition against non-sporting shotguns (such as the Armsel Striker) deemed destructive devices by the ATF, nor is there one for AOWs (Any Other Weapons). There is a specific prohibition against the possession of firearms designed to appear as a wireless telephone.[49]\\r\\nIn Illinois, muzzleloaders and black powder guns are considered firearms.[17]\\r\\nAir guns that are larger than .18 caliber and that have a muzzle velocity greater than 700 feet per second are also regulated as firearms.[50]\\r\\nIllinois has no stand-your-ground law, however there is also no duty to retreat. The use of force is justified when a person reasonably believes that it is necessary \\"to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or another, or the commission of a forcible felony.\\" There are some additional protections for defense against unlawful entry into a dwelling.[51][52]\\r\\nIllinois has state preemption of firearm laws for \\"the regulation, licensing, possession, and registration of handguns and ammunition for a handgun, and the transportation of any firearm and ammunition\\". There is also state preemption for \\"the regulation of the possession and ownership of assault weapons\\", except for laws passed before July 20, 2013, which are grandfathered in.[18] In other areas of gun law, some local governments have passed ordinances that are more restrictive than those of the state.[53]\\r\\nChicago has banned the possession of certain semi-automatic firearms that it defines as assault weapons.[54][55] Chicago residents must \\"immediately\\" report a firearm that is stolen or lost, and must report the transfer of a firearm within 48 hours of such transfer.[56] In a home where a person younger than 18 is present, all guns must be secured with a trigger lock, or stored in a locked container, or secured to the body of the legal owner.[57]\\r\\nChicago formerly prohibited the sale of firearms within city limits, but on January 6, 2014, a federal judge ruled that this was unconstitutional.[58] The judge granted the city's request for six months to pass new laws regulating gun shops.[59] On June 25, 2014, the city council passed a new law, allowing gun stores but restricting them to certain limited areas of the city, requiring that all gun sales be videotaped, and limiting buyers to one gun per 30-day period. Store owners must make their records available to the police, and employees must be trained to identify possible straw purchasers.[60] With the passage of the gun shop ordinance, Chicago also struck a previous ban on the transfer of ammunition.[61] On January 18, 2017, a federal appeals court ruled that the city's revised gun shop law was unconstitutional.[62]\\r\\nCook County has banned the possession of certain semi-automatic firearms that it has defined as assault weapons.[63][64] Residents must report to the county sheriff within 48 hours any firearms that are stolen, lost, destroyed, or sold or otherwise transferred. The sheriff may share this information with other law enforcement agencies.[65][66] Licensed firearms dealers must provide information to the county regarding purchasers and the guns they purchase, and receive approval before conducting sales.[67] An individual may not purchase more than one firearm in a 30-day period.[68] In a home where a person younger than 21 is present, all guns must be secured with a trigger lock, or stored unloaded in a locked container separate from the ammunition, or secured to the body of the legal owner.[69] In Cook County, local laws, such as those of Chicago, take precedence over county laws that regulate similar matters.[70] Cook County imposes a twenty-five dollar tax on the sale of any firearm by a retail dealer, in addition to the usual county sales tax. The county also has a tax on the sale of ammunition  five cents per round for centerfire ammunition and one cent per round for rimfire ammunition.[71]\\r\\nThe possession of firearms that have been variously defined as assault weapons is also illegal in Lincolnwood, Skokie, Evanston, Highland Park, North Chicago, Melrose Park, Riverdale, Dolton, Hazel Crest, Homewood, and the part of Buffalo Grove that's in Cook County. The storage or transportation of assault weapons is restricted in Morton Grove, Winnetka, Country Club Hills, and University Park.[72][73][74][75][76][77][78] Sales and transfers of assault weapons are prohibited in Niles.[79][80][81] In December 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case of Friedman v. Highland Park, a challenge to that city's assault weapons ban.[82] In April 2018 Deerfield changed its pre-existing law that regulated assault weapons to a ban on their possession.[83]\\r\\nOther municipalities have also enacted various firearm restrictions.[84]\\r\\nFormerly some Illinois municipalities had laws restricting the possession of handguns.\\r\\nBy the late 1980s, several Illinois municipalities had banned the possession of handguns. Chicago required the registration of all firearms but did not allow handguns to be registered, which had the effect of outlawing their possession, unless they were grandfathered in by being registered before April 16, 1982.[85][86] Additionally, several Chicago suburbs had enacted outright prohibitions on handgun possession.[87]\\r\\nOn June 26, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Washington, D.C.'s handgun ban in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller.[88] Chicago and the other municipalities came under legal pressure to change their laws.[89][90] In the months following the Heller decision, handgun bans were repealed in the suburbs of Wilmette,[91] Morton Grove,[92] Evanston,[93] and Winnetka,[94] but Chicago and Oak Park kept their laws in effect.[93][95]\\r\\nOn June 28, 2010, in the case of McDonald v. Chicago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the handgun bans of Chicago and Oak Park to be unconstitutional.[96]\\r\\nOn July 12, 2010, a new Chicago city ordinance took effect that allowed the possession of handguns with certain restrictions. Residents were required to obtain a Chicago Firearms Permit. To get the permit they were required to complete a 5-hour firearms training course, pass a background check (including fingerprinting), and pay a $100 permit fee. Chicago's gun registration requirement was retained, with new registrations beling allowed for the first time since 1982.[97][98] Possession of firearms was permitted only inside a dwelling, not in a garage or on the outside grounds of the property. Only one gun at a time was allowed to be kept in a usable state.[97]\\r\\nOn July 19, 2010, Oak Park amended its town ordinance to allow handgun possession in one's home, leaving no remaining town in Illinois that completely banned handguns.[99]\\r\\nOn July 9, 2013, Illinois enacted the Firearm Concealed Carry Act, which set up a permitting system for the concealed carry of firearms. Another provision of this law is state preemption for \\"the regulation, licensing, possession, and registration of handguns and ammunition for a handgun, and the transportation of any firearm and ammunition\\". This invalidated Chicago's requirements for gun registration and for an additional permit for the possession of firearms.[18][100]\\r\\nOn September 11, 2013, the Chicago City Council repealed the law requiring the registration of firearms and the law requiring a city issued firearm owners permit.[100][101] They also changed the law to allow the carrying of firearms on the grounds of one's property outside as well as inside the home.[102]\\r\\nIn Illinois, it is illegal to possess a throwing star or ballistic knife. A knife with a blade more than three inches in length is considered a dangerous weapon, and it is illegal to carry such a knife with an intent to inflict harm on another person's well being.[103][104]\\r\\nSome local governments have knife laws that are more restrictive than those of the state. In Chicago it is illegal to carry a knife with a blade more than two-and-a-half inches in length.[105]","input":"When did concealed carry become legal in illinois?"},{"output":"air pollution control devices that can be used to remove some particulates and/or gases from industrial exhaust streams","context":"Scrubber systems (aka Chemical Scrubbers, Gas Scrubbers) are a diverse group of air pollution control devices that can be used to remove some particulates and/or gases from industrial exhaust streams. The first air scrubber was designed to remove carbon dioxide from the air of an early submarine, the Ictineo I, a role for which they continue to be used till today.[1] Traditionally, the term \\"scrubber\\" has referred to pollution control devices that use liquid to wash unwanted pollutants from a gas stream. Recently, the term has also been used to describe systems that inject a dry reagent or slurry into a dirty exhaust stream to \\"wash out\\" acid gases. Scrubbers are one of the primary devices that control gaseous emissions, especially acid gases. Scrubbers can also be used for heat recovery from hot gases by flue-gas condensation.[2] They are also used for the high flows in solar, PV, or LED processes.[3]\\r\\nThere are several methods to remove toxic or corrosive compounds from exhaust gas and neutralize it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCombustion is sometimes the cause of harmful exhausts, but, in many cases, combustion may also be used for exhaust gas cleaning if the temperature is high enough and enough oxygen is available.[4]\\r\\nThe exhaust gases of combustion may contain substances considered harmful to the environment, and the scrubber may remove or neutralize those. A wet scrubber is used for cleaning air, fuel gas or other gases of various pollutants and dust particles. Wet scrubbing works via the contact of target compounds or particulate matter with the scrubbing solution. Solutions may simply be water (for dust) or solutions of reagents that specifically target certain compounds.\\r\\nProcess exhaust gas can also contain water-soluble toxic and/or corrosive gases like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or ammonia (NH3). These can be removed very well by a wet scrubber.[5]\\r\\nRemoval efficiency of pollutants is improved by increasing residence time in the scrubber or by the increase of surface area of the scrubber solution by the use of a spray nozzle, packed towers or an aspirator. Wet scrubbers may increase the proportion of water in the gas, resulting in a visible stack plume, if the gas is sent to a stack.\\r\\nWet scrubbers can also be used for heat recovery from hot gases by flue-gas condensation.[2] In this mode, termed a condensing scrubber, water from the scrubber drain is circulated through a cooler to the nozzles at the top of the scrubber. The hot gas enters the scrubber at the bottom. If the gas temperature is above the water dew point, it is initially cooled by evaporation of water drops. Further cooling cause water vapors to condense, adding to the amount of circulating water.\\r\\nThe condensation of water releases significant amounts of low temperature heat (more than 2 gigajoules (560?kWh) per ton of water[citation needed]), that can be recovered by the cooler for e.g. district heating purposes.\\r\\nExcess condensed water must continuously be removed from the circulating water.\\r\\nThe gas leaves the scrubber at its dew point, so even though significant amounts of water may have been removed from the cooled gas, it is likely to leave a visible stack plume of water vapor.\\r\\nA dry or semi-dry scrubbing system, unlike the wet scrubber, does not saturate the flue gas stream that is being treated with moisture. In some cases no moisture is added, while in others only the amount of moisture that can be evaporated in the flue gas without condensing is added. Therefore, dry scrubbers generally do not have a stack steam plume or wastewater handling/disposal requirements. Dry scrubbing systems are used to remove acid gases (such as SO2 and HCl) primarily from combustion sources.\\r\\nThere are a number of dry type scrubbing system designs. However, all consist of two main sections or devices: a device to introduce the acid gas sorbent material into the gas stream and a particulate matter control device to remove reaction products, excess sorbent material as well as any particulate matter already in the flue gas.\\r\\nDry scrubbing systems can be categorized as dry sorbent injectors (DSIs) or as spray dryer absorbers (SDAs). Spray dryer absorbers are also called semi-dry scrubbers or spray dryers.\\r\\nDry scrubbing systems are often used for the removal of odorous and corrosive gases from wastewater treatment plant operations. The medium used is typically an activated alumina compound impregnated with materials to handle specific gases such as hydrogen sulfide. Media used can be mixed together to offer a wide range of removal for other odorous compounds such as methyl mercaptans, aldehydes, volatile organic compounds, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide.\\r\\nDry sorbent injection involves the addition of an alkaline material (usually hydrated lime, soda ash, or sodium bicarbonate) into the gas stream to react with the acid gases. The sorbent can be injected directly into several different locations: the combustion process, the flue gas duct (ahead of the particulate control device), or an open reaction chamber (if one exists). The acid gases react with the alkaline sorbents to form solid salts which are removed in the particulate control device. These simple systems can achieve only limited acid gas (SO2 and HCl) removal efficiencies. Higher collection efficiencies can be achieved by increasing the flue gas humidity (i.e., cooling using water spray). These devices have been used on medical waste incinerators and a few municipal waste combustors.\\r\\nIn spray dryer absorbers, the flue gases are introduced into an absorbing tower (dryer) where the gases are contacted with a finely atomized alkaline slurry. Acid gases are absorbed by the slurry mixture and react to form solid salts which are removed by the particulate control device. The heat of the flue gas is used to evaporate all the water droplets, leaving a non-saturated flue gas to exit the absorber tower. Spray dryers are capable of achieving high (80+%) acid gas removal efficiencies. These devices have been used on industrial and utility boilers and municipal waste incinerators.\\r\\nMany chemicals can be removed from exhaust gas also by using absorber material. The flue gas is passed through a cartridge which is filled with one or several absorber materials and has been adapted to the chemical properties of the components to be removed.[6] This type of scrubber is sometimes also called dry scrubber. The absorber material has to be replaced after its surface is saturated.\\r\\nMercury is a highly toxic element commonly found in coal and municipal waste. Wet scrubbers are only effective for removal of soluble mercury species, such as oxidized mercury, Hg2+. Mercury vapor in its elemental form, Hg0, is insoluble in the scrubber slurry and not removed. Therefore, an additional process of Hg0 conversion is required to complete mercury capture. Usually halogens are added to the flue gas for this purpose. The type of coal burned as well as the presence of a selective catalytic reduction unit both affect the ratio of elemental to oxidized mercury in the flue gas and thus the degree to which the mercury is removed.\\r\\nIn July 2015, one study found that some mercury scrubbers installed on coal power plants inadvertently capture PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) emissions as well.[7][8]\\r\\nOne side effect of scrubbing is that the process only moves the unwanted substance from the exhaust gases into a liquid solution, solid paste or powder form. This must be disposed of safely, if it can not be reused.\\r\\nFor example, mercury removal results in a waste product that either needs further processing to extract the raw mercury, or must be buried in a special hazardous wastes landfill that prevents the mercury from seeping out into the environment.\\r\\nAs an example of reuse, limestone-based scrubbers in coal-fired power plants can produce a synthetic gypsum of sufficient quality that can be used to manufacture drywall and other industrial products.[9]\\r\\nPoorly maintained scrubbers have the potential to spread disease-causing bacteria. The problem is a result of inadequate cleaning. For example, the cause of a 2005 outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Norway was just a few infected scrubbers. The outbreak caused 10 deaths and more than 50 cases of infection.[10]","input":"What is the purpose of an air scrubber?"},{"output":"Samuel Pierpont Langley, an aerodynamic pioneer and a former Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution","context":"Langley Air Force Base  (IATA: LFI, ICAO: KLFI, FAA LID: LFI) is a United States Air Force base located adjacent to Hampton and Newport News, Virginia.

The base is one of the oldest facilities of the Air Force, having been established on 30 December 1916, prior to America's entry to World War I by the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps, named for aviation pioneer Samuel Pierpont Langley. It was used during World War I as a flying field, balloon station, observers school, photography school, experimental engineering department, and for aerial coast defense.

Langley began aerodynamic experiments in 1887 and formed a basis for practical pioneer aviation.  He built and saw the first steam model airplane in 1896 and the first gasoline model in 1903.   Both planes were believed to be capable of flight.   He also built the first man-carrying gasoline airplane in 1903, which failed to fly on its first attempt and broke apart and crashed on its second.  It was, after major modification eleven years later, flown \\"successfully\\" by Glenn Curtiss for a little over 3 seconds, traveling 150 feet through the air in 1914.[6]   Langley Field was the first Air Service base built especially for air power, is the oldest continually active air force base in the world, and is the oldest airfield in Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1916, the National Advisory Council for Aeronautics (NACA), predecessor to NASA, established the need for a joint airfield and proving ground for Army, Navy and NACA aircraft. NACA determined that the site must be near water for over-water flying, be flat and relatively clear for expansion and the landing and take-off of aircraft, and near an Army post. The Army appointed a board of officers who searched for a location. The officers sometimes posed as hunters and fishermen to avoid potential land speculation which would arise if the government's interest in purchasing land was revealed. Fifteen locations were scouted before a site near Hampton in Elizabeth City County was selected.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1917, the new proving ground was designated Langley Field for one of America's early air pioneers, Samuel Pierpont Langley. Langley had first made tests with his manned heavier-than-air craft, launched from a houseboat catapult, in 1903. His first attempts failed and he died in 1906, shortly before a rebuilt version of his craft soared into the sky.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraining units assigned to Langley Field:[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral buildings had been constructed on the field by late 1918. Aircraft on the ramp at that time included the JN-4 Curtis Jenny, used by Langley's School of Aerial Photography, and the deHavilland DH-4 bomber, both used during World War I.  Although short-lived, hydrogen-filled dirigibles played an important role in Langley's early history and a portion of the base is still referred to as the LTA (lighter-than-air) area.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1920s, Langley became the site where a new air power concept was tried and proven. Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell led bombing runs from Langley by the 1st Provisional Air Brigade over captured German warships anchored off the coast of Virginia and North Carolina. These first successful tests set the precedent for the airplane's new role of strategic bombardment.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the 1930s Langley Field occupied a principal position in the Army's efforts to strengthen the offensive and defensive posture of its air arm. The small grassy field became a major airfield of the United States Army Air Corps, and many of the brick buildings of today were constructed at that time.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the outbreak of World War II Langley took on a new mission, to develop special detector equipment used in antisubmarine warfare. Langley units played a vital role in the sinking of enemy submarines off the United States coast during the war.[7] The field was also used for training purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 May 1946 the headquarters of the newly formed Tactical Air Command were established at Langley. The command's mission was to organize, train, equip and maintain combat-ready forces capable of rapid deployment to meet the challenges of peacetime air sovereignty and wartime air defense. The arrival of Tactical Air Command and jet aircraft marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the field, and in January 1948 Langley Field officially became Langley Air Force Base.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1976 the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing was transferred to Langley from MacDill Air Force Base, Florida with the mission of maintaining combat capability for rapid global deployment to conduct air superiority operations. To accomplish this mission, the 1st TFW was the first USAF operational wing to be equipped with the F-15 Eagle.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn  1 June 1992, Langley became the headquarters of the newly formed Air Combat Command, as Tactical Air Command was inactivated as part of the Air Force's restructuring.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15 December 2005, the 1st Fighter Wing's 27th Fighter Squadron became the Air Force's first operational F-22 fighter squadron. The wing's complement of 40 F-22s, in the 27th and 94th FS reached Full Operational Capability on 12 December 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nLangley Air Force Base was severely damaged by flooding due to the storm surge from Hurricane Isabel in September 2003 and again during the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic nor'easter. Hurricane Isabel damages to Langley Air Force Base were approximately $147 million. The damages associated with the 2009 nor'easter were approximately $43 million.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo accomplish their mission, the support unit men and women of the 633d Air Base Wing at Langley are housed in the Mission Support Groups and Medical Group and support several tenant units:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOperational squadrons of the 1st Operations Group are: (Tail Code: FF)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wing is composed of the following units worldwide:\\r\\n\\r\\nLangley also hosts the Air Force Command and Control Integration Center field operating agency and Headquarters Air Combat Command (ACC).\\r\\n\\r\\nLangley is also home to the F-22 Raptor Demo Team. This team, who travel all over the world performing different maneuvers used in air combat, is used to help recruit for the United States Air Force.

He played for six different teams, most notably the Cleveland Indians during the 1990s and early 2000s. A prolific power hitter, Thome hit 612 home runs during his careerthe eighth-most all timealong with 2,328 hits, 1,699 runs batted in (RBIs), and a .276 batting average. He was a member of five All-Star teams and won a Silver Slugger Award in 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\nThome grew up in Peoria, Illinois, as part of a large blue-collar family of athletes, who predominantly played baseball and basketball. After attending Illinois Central College, he was drafted by the Indians in 1989 and made his major league debut in 1991. Early in his career, he played third base before eventually becoming a first baseman. With the Indians, Thome was part of a core of players that led the franchise to two World Series appearances in three years during the mid-1990s. He spent over a decade with Cleveland before leaving via free agency after the 2002 season to join the Philadelphia Phillies, with whom he spent the following three seasons. Traded to the Chicago White Sox before the 2006 season, Thome won the American League Comeback Player of the Year Award that year and reached the 500 home run club during his three-season tenure with the team. By this point in his career, back pain limited Thome to being a designated hitter. After stints with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Minnesota Twins, he made brief returns to Cleveland and Philadelphia before ending his career with the Baltimore Orioles. Upon retiring, Thome accepted an executive position with the White Sox.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout his career, Thome's strength was power hitting. In six different seasons, he hit more than 40 home runs, and in 2003, he led the National League in home runs with 47. His career on-base plus slugging (OPS) of .956 is 19th all time. In 2011, he became the eighth MLB player to hit 600 home runs. As of 2017 Thome is the career leader in walk-off home runs with 13.[2] One of Thome's trademarks was his unique batting stance, in which he held the bat out with his right hand and pointed it at right field before the pitcher threw, something he first saw in The Natural. Thome was known for his consistently positive attitude and \\"gregarious\\" personality. An active philanthropist during his playing career, he was honored with two Marvin Miller Man of the Year Awards and a Lou Gehrig Memorial Award for his community involvement. In 2018, Thome was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThome was born in Peoria, Illinois, on August 27, 1970, and is the youngest of five children.[4] Many of the Thome family played sports: Jim's grandmother was hired at a local Caterpillar plant solely to play for the company's softball team; his father built bulldozers for Caterpillar and played slow-pitch softball;[4][5] his aunt Caroline Thome Hart is in the Women's Softball Hall of Fame;[6] and his two older brothers, Chuck III and Randy, played baseball at Limestone High School.[4]  Thome learned to play baseball from his father on a tennis court, and also played basketball in what he described as the \\"ghetto\\" of Peoria, noting that he was the only white kid there but that he earned the respect of his fellow players.[6] One day during his youth, Thome sneaked into the Cubs' clubhouse at Wrigley Field in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain an autograph from his favorite player, Dave Kingman. Though Thome received signatures from several other players, this experience influenced him to be generous with signing autographs for fans during his playing career.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike his older brothers, Thome attended Limestone High School where he achieved all-state honors in basketball and as a baseball shortstop.[4] He played American Legion Baseball for Bartonville Limestone Post 979 in his hometown, as well.[7] Although he had hoped to draw the attention of scouts, at just 175 pounds (79?kg) he was relatively underweight for his 6-foot-2-inch (188?cm) height, meaning that he attracted only passing interestthe average Major League Baseball (MLB) player weighed 195 pounds (88?kg) in 1993.[6][8] Thome graduated in 1988 and, after not being drafted, enrolled at Illinois Central College where he continued his baseball and basketball careers.[4] After one season, he was drafted by MLB's Cleveland Indians as an \\"afterthought\\" in the 13th round of the 1989 MLB draft.[6][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 1989 season, Thome was assigned to the Gulf Coast League Indians, a minor league affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. He finished the year with a .237 batting average, no home runs, and 22 runs batted in (RBIs).[10] After his rookie season, he met \\"hitting guru\\" Charlie Manuel,[11][12] who later became his manager and mentor. Unlike most Indians staff, Manuel saw potential in Thome and worked hard with him, particularly on his hip motion while swinging the bat. Thome later said, \\"[Manuel] saw something in me I didn't.\\" During this work, Manuel suggested to Thome that he point his bat out to center field before the pitch to relax himself like Roy Hobbs did when batting in the baseball film The Natural.[13] The work paid off; in 1990, Thome hit .340 and totaled 16 home runs and 50 RBIs playing at both the Rookie and Class A levels of the minor leagues. Thome spent most of the 1991 season splitting time between Double-A and Triple-A where, in combination, he hit .319 with 7 home runs and 73 RBIs.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThome made his MLB debut on September 4, 1991, as a third baseman against the Minnesota Twins. In the game, he recorded two hits in four at bats (2-for-4).[15][16] He hit his first career home run on October 4.[17] Injuries shortened his 1992 campaign, during which he played for both the Indians and their Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. Across the minor and major leagues that year, he combined to hit .236 with 4 home runs and 26 RBIs in 52 games.[18] In 1993, playing mostly for the Charlotte Knights, the Indians' new Triple-A affiliate, he led the International League with a .332 batting average and 102 RBIs, complemented by 25 home runs. This performance earned him a late season promotion to the major league, where he hit .266 with 7 home runs and 22 RBIs in 47 games.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter seven consecutive seasons with a losing record, \\"a new ballpark and a few offseason acquisitions coupled with rising young stars have made the Indians legitimate contenders\\" for the division title during their 1994 season.[19] The Indians' core of offensive players included Carlos Baerga, Kenny Lofton, Sandy Alomar, Jr., Thome, and Eddie Murray.[19] A \\"promising youngster\\",[19] for the first time in his career, Thome spent the entire 1994 season with Cleveland, playing in 98 games while hitting .268 with 20 home runs and 52 RBIs.[16] With help from the aforementioned core, the Indians held the wild card spot in the American League (AL) and were one game behind the Chicago White Sox in the standings for the AL Central Division lead before the 1994 players' strike forced cancellation of the season's remaining games.[20] During the strike-shortened season, Thome had his first career multi-home run game, hitting two solo home runs on June 22, 1994, against Detroit Tigers' pitcher John Doherty.[17][21] It was not until 1995 that the Indians' success led to a playoff berth.[18] Thome was among the team's leaders at the plate, hitting .314 with 25 home runs and 73 RBIs,[22] and the Indians finished with a 100ÿ44 record to win the AL Central but lost the 1995 World Series to the Atlanta Braves in six games.[22] Thome hit .211 in the World Series with one home run and two RBIs.[18] Preceding the Indians' 1996 season, sportswriters predicted that Thome would be moved up in the batting order and bat in the sixth position (he had hit anywhere from the fifth to the eighth positions during his first two seasons).[21][23][24] During the 1996 season, Thome hit 38 home runs, once hitting a 511-foot (156?m) homer at Cleveland's Jacobs Field, the longest home run ever at a Cleveland ballpark.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore their 1997 season, the Indians moved Thome, originally a third baseman, to first base after acquiring third baseman Matt Williams from the San Francisco Giants.[25][26] That year, Thome helped the Indians set a new franchise single-season record for home runs (220), contributing 40 of them.[27] Thome also totaled an AL-high 120 walks to go along with 102 RBIs. Cleveland returned to the World Series, but they lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games; Thome hit .286 with two home runs and four RBIs in the World Series.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next three seasons were not as successful as the previous three for either Thome or the Indians. In July 1998, Thome hit his 24th home run of that season while helping the Indians end the Yankees' 10-game winning streak.[28][29] An article in Sports Illustrated published in July 1998 commented that despite Thome's early career success (two All-Star Games and appearances in two of the previous three World Series), he was only \\"faintly famous\\" nationally and was not particularly well known outside of Cleveland or his hometown, Peoria. His former teammate Jeromy Burnitz said, \\"You can't really say he's underrated, because everybody considers him one of the top hitters in the American League, but he's surrounded by so many good players, it's hard to stand out on that team.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August, Thome broke a bone in his right hand and spent several weeks on the disabled list, missing 35 games.[18][30][31] He finished the year with 30 home runs and 85 RBIs while posting a .293 batting average. In Game 3 of the AL Championship Series against the New York Yankees, he hit two home runs off Andy Pettitte en route to a 6ÿ1 Cleveland victory.[32] Cleveland subsequently lost the series to the Yankees.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nHeaded into Cleveland's 1999 season, there were high hopes for the Indians; writers expected Thome to bat in the cleanup spot of the batting order.[31] In May 1999, Thome hit a grand slam against Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernndez, which helped Cleveland to a 7ÿ1 victory.[34] In total, his batting average fell to .277, but he increased both his home run and RBI totals to 33 and 108, respectively. In Game 1 of the AL Division Series, Thome hit a game-tying two-run home run off of Derek Lowe that sprung Cleveland's defeat of the Boston Red Sox by a score of 3ÿ2.[35] However, after leading two-games-to-none, Cleveland lost the five-game series.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2000 season, Thome hit .269 with 37 home runs and 106 RBIs.[18] On June 21, he hit his 20th home run of the year against the Chicago White Sox, marking the seventh consecutive season in which he hit 20 or more home runs.[36] On September 29, while in the midst of a tight race for the AL Wild Card spot, Thome led the Indians to an 8ÿ4 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays by hitting a two-run home run. After the game, Thome was quoted as saying, \\"This team has battled all year, so this was nothing new. Here we are, and we're here tomorrow to play another day.\\"[37] Despite finishing with a record of 90ÿ72, the Indians missed the playoffs.[38] For the 2001 Indians' season, he finished second in the AL with 49 home runs.[39] In addition, Thome had 124 RBIs and 111 walks. However, he led the league with 185 strikeouts.[18] He and Juan Gonzlez, who totaled 140 RBIs,[40] powered the Indians to another division title. Despite these numbers, the Indians could once again only reach the AL Division Series, where they lost in five games to the Seattle Mariners.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThome had his best season with Cleveland in 2002, leading the AL in walks (122), slugging percentage (.677) and on-base plus slugging (OPS) (1.122), while batting .304 (16th in AL) with a .445 on-base percentage (second in AL). He also hit a career-high 52 home runs (2nd in AL) and collected 118 RBIs (seventh in AL).[42] The 52 home runs set a new Cleveland Indians' single-season record and made Thome the 21st major league player to join the 50 home run club.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 6, 2002, Thome, who was a free agent, signed a six-year, $85 million contract[45] with the Philadelphia Phillies ÿ he thought the Phillies were closer to winning a championship than the Indians.[46] With the Phillies, Thome's salary rose from $8 million per year to $11 million per year.[16] Thome hit a franchise record 334 home runs in his first stint with the Indians.[46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThome hit 47 home runs in his first season with the Phillies, finishing one behind Mike Schmidt's single-season team record of 48 in 1980, and tied with Alex Rodriguez for the MLB lead in 2003.[48][49] On June 14, 2004 at Citizens Bank Park, Thome hit his 400th career home run, surpassing Al Kaline for 37th on the all-time home run list.[50] He ended the 2004 Phillies season with 42 home runs.[18] In 2004, Thome won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, which is given to players who best exemplify Gehrig's character and integrity both on and off the field.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThome missed a significant portion of the first half of the Phillies' 2005 season due to injury;[52] he compiled only a .207 batting average with 7 home runs and 30 RBIs going into the All-Star break. He had season-ending surgery on his right elbow in August,[53] while his replacement at first base, Ryan Howard, won the NL Rookie of the Year Award.[54] The Phillies traded Thome and cash considerations to the Chicago White Sox on November 25, 2005, for outfielder Aaron Rowand and minor league pitching prospects Gio Gonzlez and Daniel Haigwood.[53] Though the emergence of Howard made Thome more expendable to the squad, another factor in his trade to the White Sox was his family situation ÿ Thome's mother, the \\"go-to lady\\" in his family and his biggest fan,[55] had died a year earlier, and he worried about his father. Since Philadelphia was willing to trade him, Thome waived the no-trade clause in his contract for the good of the team and requested that if possible, they trade him to Chicago so he could be with his father.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThome became Chicago's regular designated hitter in April 2006 and flourished in his first season in Chicago. He set the team record for most home runs in the month of April (10), overtaking Frank Thomas's previous record by one.[57] He also set a major league record by scoring in each of Chicago's first 17 games.[58] For the season, Thome hit 42 home runs, drove in 109 runs, and hit .288, though he struck out in 30% of his plate appearances, the highest percentage in the AL.[59] On May 1, 2006, Thome returned to Cleveland to play against the Indians in his first game as a visitor at Jacobs Field, and received an unenthusiastic reception.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 16, 2007, Thome joined the 500 home run club by hitting a walk-off home run against Los Angeles Angels pitcher Dustin Moseley.[61] Thome became the 23rd major leaguer to reach the milestone and the third in the 2007 MLB season (the others were Frank Thomas and Alex Rodriguez), as well as the first ever to do it with a walk-off home run.[61][62] Several family members including his father were on hand to witness the accomplishment,[63] which occurred at a game during which the White Sox distributed free Thome bobbleheads to fans. Thome celebrated by pointing upward in homage to his late mother as he rounded the bases.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 4, 2008, Thome hit a 464-foot (141?m) home runwhich at the time was the ninth-longest home run in U.S. Cellular Field historyagainst Kansas City Royals pitcher Luke Hochevar in a 6ÿ4 White Sox victory.[65] He hit a solo home run in the AL Central Tiebreaker game, which proved to be the difference as the White Sox defeated the Minnesota Twins, 1ÿ0.[66] Thome's hitting remained strong during Chicago's 2009 season ÿ he hit his 550th career home run.[67] On July 17, 2009, he hit a grand slam and a three-run home run for a single-game career-high seven RBIs.[68] By the conclusion of the season, he had passed Reggie Jackson for 11th place on the all-time home run list with 564 home runs.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 31, 2009, the White Sox traded Thome to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with financial considerations for minor league infielder Justin Fuller.[70] Thome waived his no-trade clause because he thought the Dodgers could win the World Series, something he had never done during his career,[71] but Thome's only appearances with the Dodgers were as a pinch hitter, due to chronic foot injuries that limited his mobility.[72] Thome reunited with former Cleveland teammate Manny Ramirez in Los Angeles.[73] He hit .235 with no home runs and three RBIs while with the Dodgers (4-for-17). After the season, Thome filed for free agency, eventually signing with the Minnesota Twins.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThome hit his first home run with the Twins on April 8, during the Twins' season-opening road trip.[17] The Twins opened Target Field, their new home stadium, on April 12, 2010.[75] This was the third time in Thome's career that his team had opened a new stadium ÿ the 1994 Cleveland Indians when they opened Jacobs Field,[76][77] and the 2004 Philadelphia Phillies when they opened Citizens Bank Park.[78] On July 3, Thome hit two home runs, passing fellow Twin Harmon Killebrew for tenth on the all-time home run list.[79] The game was stopped and the Twins played a pre-recorded message from Killebrew congratulating Thome on the accomplishment, during which Killebrew noted he was happy Thome did it while a member of the Twins.[80][81] Thome hit the first walk-off hit in Target Field on August 17, a 445-foot two-run home run in the bottom of the 10th inning against the White Sox.[82] It was the 12th walk-off home run of his career, tying him for the most all time (a record he subsequently broke).[83] On September 4, Thome again hit two home runs in a single game to tie and then pass Mark McGwire for the ninth spot on the career home run list.[84] Thome surpassed Frank Robinson's home run total on September 11, when he hit his 587th career home run in the top of the 12th inning in Cleveland.[85] Toward the end of the season, Thome commented that playing with the Twins made him feel rejuvenated.[86] He finished the 2010 season with a .283 average, 25 home runs and 59 RBIs.[87] Thome posted his best slugging percentage since 2002.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2011, Thome accepted a one-year, $3 million contract with incentives to continue playing for the Twins.[89] On July 17, Thome hit the longest home run ever at Target Field, a 490-foot (150?m) home run into the upper deck in right-center field.[90] He hit his 599th and 600th career home runs (in two straight at bats) at Comerica Park in Detroit on August 15, making him only the eighth player to achieve that home run total.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 26, 2011, Thome waived his contractual no-trade clause to return to his first team, the Cleveland Indians, in exchange for future considerations for the Twins.[92][93] On September 18, the clubs announced that Minnesota had received $20,000 for him, which Aaron Gleeman of NBC Sports called \\"silly\\" and \\"nothing\\"; Paul Hoynes of The Plain Dealer wrote that ticket and jersey sales alone from re-acquiring Thome covered the money they paid to acquire him.[94][95] On September 23, Cleveland held a ceremony to honor Thome, and revealed plans to erect a statue depicting him in Heritage Park. In the game, he hit a home run that landed near the proposed location for his statue.[96] While with Cleveland in 2011, Thome played in 22 games, predominantly hitting fifth in the batting order, and he posted a .296 batting average with 3 home runs and 10 RBIs.[16] Through 2011, he was second among all active major leaguers in career home runs (604; behind Alex Rodriguez) and RBIs (1,674; Rodriguez), and fifth in career slugging percentage (.556; behind Albert Pujols, Rodriguez, Ryan Braun, and Howard).[97] Thome was the Indians' all-time leader in home runs (337), walks (1,008), and strikeouts (1,400).[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 2011 season, Thome agreed to a one-year, $1.25 million deal that returned him to Philadelphia.[99] He called coming back to Philadelphia a \\"no-brainer\\" in his news conference.[100] He also mentioned that, due to Ryan Howard's Achilles tendon injury, he would \\"spend the offseason preparing himself to play first base once or twice a week\\", despite not having played defensively since 2007.[101] Thome started his first game at first base since 2007 on April 8, 2012, during which he started a 3ÿ6ÿ3 double play.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nThome experienced stiffness in his lower back in the Phillies' game against the Chicago Cubs on April 28,[103] and early in May, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained lower back.[104] At the time, he was batting only .100.[105] Thome returned to the club in early June, and prepared for interleague play against the Baltimore Orioles as the DH. Thome finished the nine-game interleague road trip with four home runs and 14 RBIs.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 17, Thome became the fourth major league player to hit 100 home runs with three different teams, joining Reggie Jackson, Darrell Evans and Rodriguez.[107] Six days later, Thome hit a pinch-hit walk-off home run in the ninth inning off of Jake McGee to beat the Tampa Bay Rays, 7ÿ6. This was Thome's 609th home run, tying Sammy Sosa for seventh all-time in home runs while also setting the new record for most walk-off home runs (13) in the modern era.[108] Thome's last game as a Phillie was an afternoon loss to the Miami Marlins on June 30. After the game (which coincided with Howard's return from the disabled list), the team announced that Thome had been traded to Baltimore to serve as their designated hitter.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Orioles cited Thome's veteran experience on a playoff-bound team as a primary factor in acquiring him.[110][111] Orioles catcher Matt Wieters said of Thome,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I think you look at him and say: This is a guy who loves the game more than anyone. He's the first guy to the park, the first guy to the weight room, the first guy hitting.\\"[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 20, Thome hit his first home run with the Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field.[113] On August 6, Thome was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21.[114] In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox.[115] After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, \\"There's a lot [of] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time.\\"[116] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, \\"I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray when he was in his 40s.\\"[112] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit .133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 2, 2013, Thome joined the White Sox organization as special assistant to the general manager.[118] In the future, Thome aspires to be a manager, an aspiration that White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf wholeheartedly supports; Reinsdorf commented, \\"He can be a batting coach. He'd be a great batting coach, but someday he'll be a manager.\\"[119] In March 2014, Thome clarified that he is not officially retired; while he \\"loves\\" his front office job with the White Sox, he would \\"have to take\\" a call about him playing again.[120] However, on August 2, 2014, he signed a one-day contract with the Cleveland Indians to retire officially as a member of the team.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 24, 2018, Thome was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.[3] He was formally inducted on July 29, 2018, alongside Trevor Hoffman, Vladimir Guerrero, and Chipper Jones.[122] The Indians retired Thome's number 25 on August 18, 2018.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nThome is regarded as a great example of a \\"pure\\" power hitter, as indicated by his .278 Isolated Power (ISO) rating.[124] Thome's consistency was a draw for clubs to continue to sign him, even toward the very end of his 22-year career and after most sluggers' productivity fades.[125] In 2011, he was ranked the sixth-best designated hitter in MLB history by Fox Sports.[126] During his career, he compiled a .284 batting average against fastballs but compiled just a .170 batting average against sliders.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Thome was a pull hitter, opposing teams often employed a defensive shift against him; by playing three infielders on the right side of the field and the outfielders towards his pull side, teams put themselves in better position to field batted balls.[128][129] In 2011, Lindy's Sports described him as an \\"extremely patient veteran slugger who launches cripple fastballs and breaking-ball mistakes to all fields\\", though they did note that he struck out frequently, had poor speed, and should serve only as a designated hitter.[130] During his career, he had strong power numbers; in 15 of his 22 seasons, he had a slugging percentage of over .500.[16] He is an example of a \\"three-true-outcome\\" player; 47.6% of his career plate appearances resulted in either home runs, strikeouts, or walks, the highest of all time by nearly seven percentage points.[131] He is a self-described slow runner, but has said that he always hustled.[131] He stole only 19 bases after 1994.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nThome began his career playing third base and did so until the 1997 season, when he converted to first base to make room at third after the Indians traded for Matt Williams.[133][134] Injuries, however, took their toll and confined him almost exclusively to being a designated hitter in the latter stages of his career.[125] Overall, he spent 10 separate stints on the disabled list, mostly for his back.[135][136][137][138] By the end of Thome's career, his back prevented him from playing the field effectively[139] ÿ he played first base four times with the Phillies in 2012, which marked the first time he played the field since 2007 with the White Sox.[140] By the end of his career, writers described him as being a \\"huge liability in the field\\".[141]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThome was known throughout the baseball world for wearing high socks and for his unique batting stance.[4] In 1997, the Indians wore high socks for his birthday in August, but ended up wearing them for the remainder of the season out of superstition and eventually reached the World Series. Upon his return to the Indians in 2011, the club again sported the high socks as a tribute.[142] His batting stance featured him pointing his bat to center field prior to the pitch.[143] Thome adopted this stance from Charlie Manuel, who was the Indians hitting coach, and since then Ryan Howard has also adopted it.[144] Thome credits his calm demeanor to his role model during his early playing years, Eddie Murray, once commenting, \\r\\n\\"Eddie taught me to play the game exactly the same when you fail and when you succeed. Hit a home run, hey, enjoy the moment, but then let it go. If you strike out with the bases loaded, same thing, let it go. I don't smash helmets when I strike out, because it's not the helmet's fault, it's my fault.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThome's friendly personality has been the subject of much attention. In a 2007 poll of 464 MLB players, he tied with Mike Sweeney for second-friendliest player, behind Sean Casey.[145] After Thome hit his 600th home run, Twins closer Joe Nathan said, \\"He is the world's nicest man.\\"[146] Teammate Michael Cuddyer added, \\"He is the nicest, gentlest, kindest guy you will ever meet?... to everything except the baseball, he still hits that really hard.\\"[146] His kindness comes up in conversations with many MLB players.[143] When he signed with the Phillies in the offseason before the 2012 season, Phillies general manager Rubn Amaro, Jr. cited Thome's constant positive attitude as a main reason for his signing.[147] As an exercise in remaining humble, he annually visited his high school prior to spring training.[5] A Sports Illustrated article said that Thome frequently signs autographs for fans and that he is \\"endlessly patient with requests\\".[4][148] In a piece for Philadelphia magazine discussing Thome's Baseball Hall of Fame prospects, sportswriter Stephen Silver wrote, \\r\\n\\"It's not just the numbers. Thanks to his gregarious personality, Thome is the rare athlete who played in several cities and was beloved everywhere he went. I saw the Twins and Phillies play each other in Philadelphia when Thome was with the Twins, and the same two teams in Minnesota two years later when Thome was a Phillie, and the opposing crowd cheered Thome both times, even when he hit home runs for the road team. Thome was similarly loved in his long stints in Cleveland and Chicago, as well as shorter runs in Los Angeles and Baltimore.\\"[149]\\r\\n\\r\\n A fan poll in The Plain Dealer in 2003 named him the most popular athlete in Cleveland sports history.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite his injuries throughout his later years, Thome totaled, according to Fangraphs, 71.6 Wins Above Replacement (WAR), a sabermetrics baseball statistic intended to quantify a player's total contributions to a team.[151] He was one of few players whose prime was during the steroid era and was not suspected of using steroids; Thome adamantly denies ever using performance-enhancing drugs.[152][153] Soon after the announcement of his front office position (which signified the end of his playing career), writers began to speculate as to whether or not Thome would make it to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and more specifically, whether he would gain entrance in his first year of eligibility in 2018.[154][155] Writers also questioned whether Thome's candidacy would be hindered by his lack of self-promotion and others' tendency to overlook him.[156][157]\\r\\n\\r\\nThome and his wife, Andrea, have two children, Lila Grace and Landon.[158] He has also established funds to put his 10 nieces and nephews through college.[159] During the offseason he lives in Burr Ridge, Illinois.[5] ESPN's SportsCenter reported that shortly after his nephew, Brandon, was paralyzed in an accident, he asked Thome to hit a home run for him; Thome obliged, hitting two in the subsequent game.[160] Thome is also a philanthropist and provided help to the communities surrounding the teams for which he played. In recognition of his community involvement, he was given the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award in 2001 and 2004, and the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award in 2004.[161] In 2013, after the November 17, 2013 tornado outbreak struck Washington, Illinois, just 15 miles from his hometown, he and his wife pledged to donate $100,000 to relief efforts.[162] Among the philanthropic endeavors Thome and his wife heavily support are Children's Home + Aid, which strives to help underprivileged children predominantly with finding care (e.g., foster care, adoption, etc.),[163] and an annual benefit to raise money for the Children's Hospital of Illinois, continuing a tradition his mother started years ago.[164] Moreover, the Thomes try \\"to stay connected with at least one or two organizations in each of the cities\\" that Thome has played.[163]\\r\\n\\r\\nItalics denotes active player","input":"Where did jim thome go to high school?"},{"output":"Xingu River","context":"Aweti??

They have many cultural similarities despite their different ethnologies. Xingu people represent fifteen tribes and all four of Brazil's indigenous language groups, but they share similar belief systems, rituals and ceremonies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Upper Xingu region was heavily populated prior to European and African contact. Densely populated settlements developed from 1200 to 1600 AD.[1] Ancient roads and bridges linked communities that were often surrounded by ditches or moats. The villages were pre-planned and featured circular plazas. Archaeologists have unearthed 19 villages so far.[2]\\r\\nKuikuro oral history says European slavers arrived in the Xingu region around 1750. Xinuguano population was estimated in the tens of thousands but was dramatically reduced by diseases and slavery by Europeans.[2] In the centuries since the penetration of the Europeans into South America, the Xingu fled from different regions to escape modernization and cultural assimilation. Nonetheless settlers made it up as far as the upper run of the Rio Xingu. By the end of the 19th century, about 3,000 natives lived at the Alto Xingu, where their current political status has kept them protected against European intruders. By the mid twentieth century this number had been reduced by foreign epidemic diseases such as flu, measles, smallpox and malaria to less than 1,000. Only an estimated 500 Xingu peoples were alive in the 1950s.[2]\\r\\nThe Brazilian Villas-B?as brothers visited the area beginning in 1946, and pushed for the creation of the Parque Indgena do Xingu, eventually established in 1961. Their story is told in a film, Xingu. The number of Xingu living there in 32 settlements has risen again to over 3000 inhabitants, half of them younger than 15 years.\\r\\nThe Xingu living in this region have similar habits and social systems, despite different languages.

Flash Player can run from a web browser as a browser plug-in or on supported mobile devices. Flash Player was created by Macromedia and has been developed and distributed by Adobe Systems since Adobe acquired Macromedia.\\r\\nFlash Player runs SWF files that can be created by the Adobe Animate and Adobe Flash Professional authoring tools, by Adobe Flash Builder or by third party tools such as FlashDevelop. Flash Player supports vector and raster graphics, 3D graphics, an embedded scripting language called ActionScript, and streaming of video and audio. ActionScript is based on ECMAScript, and supports object-oriented code, and is similar to JavaScript. Flash Player has a wide user base, and is a common format for games, animations, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) embedded in web pages. Adobe stated in 2013 that more than 400 million out of over 1 billion connected desktops update to the new version of Flash Player within six weeks of release.[6]\\r\\nFlash Player is distributed for free and its plug-in versions are available for every major web browser and operating system. Google Chrome comes bundled with the sandboxed Adobe Flash plug-in[7][8] and Windows 8 and later come with their own integrated Flash Player (for Internet Explorer and Edge).[9][10][11]\\r\\nFlash Player has become increasingly criticized for its performance, consumption of battery on mobile devices, the number of security vulnerabilities that had been discovered in the software, and that Flash is a closed platform. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was highly critical of Flash Player, having published an open letter detailing Apple's reasoning for banning the Flash platform from being used on its iOS device family. Its usage has also waned due to modern web standards that allow some of Flash's use cases to be fulfilled without third-party plugins.[12][13][14] In July 2017, Adobe announced[15] that it would end support for Flash Player in 2020, and continued to encourage the use of open HTML5 standards in place of Flash.[16][17] The announcement was coordinated with Apple,[18] Facebook,[19] Google,[20] Microsoft,[21] and Mozilla.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdobe Flash Player is a runtime that executes and displays content from a provided SWF file, although it has no in-built features to modify the SWF file at runtime. It can execute software written in the ActionScript programming language which enables the runtime manipulation of text, data, vector graphics, raster graphics, sound and video. The player can also access certain connected hardware devices, including web cameras and microphones, after permission for the same has been granted by the user.\\r\\nFlash Player is used internally by the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR), to provide a cross-platform runtime environment for desktop applications and mobile applications. AIR supports installable applications on Windows, Linux, macOS, and some mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android. Flash applications must specifically be built for the AIR runtime to use additional features provided, such as file system integration, native client extensions, native window/screen integration, taskbar/dock integration, and hardware integration with connected Accelerometer and GPS devices.[23]\\r\\nFlash Player includes native support for many different data formats, some of which can only be accessed through the ActionScript scripting interface.\\r\\nFlash Player is primarily a graphics and multimedia platform, and has supported raster graphics and vector graphics since its earliest version. It supports the following different multimedia formats which it can natively decode and playback.\\r\\nUntil version 10 of the Flash player, there was no support for GPU acceleration. Version 10 added a limited form of support for shaders on materials in the form of the Pixel Bender API, but still did not have GPU-accelerated 3D vertex processing.[42] A significant change came in version 11, which added a new low-level API called Stage3D (initially codenamed Molehill), which provides full GPU acceleration, similar to WebGL.[43][44] (The partial support for GPU acceleration in Pixel Bender was completely removed in Flash 11.8, resulting in the disruption of some projects like MIT's Scratch, which lacked the manpower to recode their applications quickly enough.[45][46])\\r\\nCurrent versions of Flash Player are optimized to use hardware acceleration for video playback and 3D graphics rendering on many devices, including desktop computers. Performance is similar to HTML5 video playback.[47][48] Also, Flash Player has been used on multiple mobile devices as a primary user interface renderer.[49]\\r\\nAlthough code written in ActionScript 3 executes up to 10 times faster than the prior ActionScript 2,[50] the Adobe ActionScript 3 compiler is a non-optimizing compiler, and produces inefficient bytecode in the resulting SWF, when compared to toolkits such as CrossBridge.[51][52][53][54][55]\\r\\nCrossBridge, a toolkit that targets C++ code to run within the Flash Player, uses the LLVM compiler to produce bytecode that runs up to 10 times faster than code the ActionScript 3 compiler produces, only because the LLVM compiler uses more aggressive optimization.[53][54][55]\\r\\nAdobe has released ActionScript Compiler 2 (ASC2) in Flex 4.7 and onwards, which improves compilation times and optimizes the generated bytecode and supports method inlining, improving its performance at runtime.[56]\\r\\nAs of 2012, the Haxe multiplatform language can build programs for Flash Player that perform faster than the same application built with the Adobe Flex SDK compiler.[57][unreliable source?]\\r\\nFlash Player applications and games can be built in two significantly different methods:\\r\\nIn both methods, developers can access the full Flash Player set of functions, including text, vector graphics, bitmap graphics, video, audio, camera, microphone, and others. AIR also includes added features such as file system integration, native extensions, native desktop integration, and hardware integration with connected devices.\\r\\nAdobe provides five ways of developing applications for Flash Player:\\r\\nThird-party development environments are also available:\\r\\nAdobe offers the free Adobe Gaming SDK, consisting (as of August 2014[update]) of several open-source AS3 libraries built on the Flash Player Stage3D APIs for GPU-accelerated graphics:[65]\\r\\nA few commercial game engines target Flash Player (Stage3D) as run-time environment, such as Unity 3D[66] and Unreal Engine 3.[66][67] Before the introduction of Stage3D, a number of older 2D engines or isometric engines like Flixel saw their heyday.[68]\\r\\nAdobe also developed the CrossBridge toolkit which cross-compiles C/C++ code to run within the Flash Player, using LLVM and GCC as compiler backends, and high-performance memory-access opcodes in the Flash Player (termed \\"Domain Memory\\") to work with in-memory data quickly.[69] CrossBridge is targeted toward the game development industry,[70] and includes tools for building, testing, and debugging C/C++ projects in Flash Player.\\r\\nNotable online video games developed in Flash include Angry Birds, FarmVille and FarmVille 2, and AdventureQuest (started in 2002, and still active as of 2011).[71]\\r\\nThe latest version of Flash Player is available for Windows XP and later, Mac OS X 10.6 and later and Linux.\\r\\nAdobe Flash Player is available in four flavors:\\r\\nOn February 22, 2012, Adobe announced that it would no longer release new versions of NPAPI Flash plugins for Linux, although Flash Player 11.2 would continue to receive security updates.[73][74][75] In August 2016 Adobe announced that, beginning with version 24, it will resume offering of Flash Player for Linux for other browsers.[76]\\r\\nThe Extended Support Release (ESR) of Flash Player on macOS and Windows was a version of Flash Player kept up to date with security updates, but none of the new features or bug fixes available in later versions. It has been on version 11.7 as of July 9, 2013,[77] version 13 as of May 13, 2014,[78] and version 18 as of August 11, 2015.[79] Adobe has decided to discontinue the ESR branch and instead focus solely on the standard release as of August 2016.[80]\\r\\nIn 2011, Flash Player had emerged as the de facto standard for online video publishing on the desktop, with adaptive bitrate video streaming, DRM, and fullscreen support.[31][32] On mobile devices however, after Apple refused to allow the Flash Player within the inbuilt iOS web browser, Adobe changed strategy, enabling Flash content to be delivered as native mobile applications using the Adobe Integrated Runtime.\\r\\nUp until 2012, Flash Player 11 was available for the Android (ARM Cortex-A8 and above),[84][85] although in June 2012, Google announced that Android 4.1 (codenamed Jelly Bean) would not support Flash by default. Starting in August 2012, Adobe no longer updates Flash for Android.[86] In spite of this, Adobe Flash is still available to install on Android devices via Adobe's update archives (up to Android 4.3).\\r\\nFlash Player is certified to be supported on a select range of mobile and tablet devices, from Acer, BlackBerry 10, Dell, HTC, Lenovo, Logitech, LG, Motorola, Samsung, Sharp, SoftBank, Sony (and Sony Ericsson), and Toshiba.[87][88][89] As of 2012, Adobe has stopped browser-based Flash Player development for mobile browsers in favor of HTML5,[90][91] however Adobe continues to support Flash content on mobile devices with the Adobe Integrated Runtime, which allows developers to publish content that runs as native applications on certain supported mobile phone platforms.\\r\\nVersion 9 is the most recent version currently available for the Linux/ARM-based Nokia 770/N800/N810 Internet tablets running Maemo OS2008, classic Mac OS and Windows 95/NT.[92] Version 10 can be run under Windows 98/Me using KernelEx. HP offers Version 6 of the player for HP-UX.[93] Other versions of the player have been available at some point for OS/2, Symbian OS, Palm OS, BeOS and IRIX.[94] The Kodak Easyshare One includes Flash Player.[95]\\r\\nAdobe said it will optimize Flash for use on ARM architecture (ARMv7 and ARMv6 architectures used in the Cortex-A series of processors and in the ARM11 family) and release it in the second half of 2009. The company also stated it wants to enable Flash on NVIDIA Tegra, Texas Instruments OMAP 3 and Samsung ARMs.[96][97] Beginning 2009, it was announced that Adobe would be bringing Flash to TV sets via Intel Media Processor CE 3100 before mid-2009.[98] ARM Holdings later said it welcomes the move of Flash, because \\"it will transform mobile applications and it removes the claim that the desktop controls the Internet.\\"[99] However, as of May 2009, the expected ARM/Linux netbook devices had poor support for Web video and fragmented software base.[100]\\r\\nAmong other devices, LeapFrog Enterprises provides Flash Player with their Leapster Multimedia Learning System and extended the Flash Player with touch-screen support.[101] Sony has integrated Flash Player 6 into the PlayStation Portable's web browser via firmware version 2.70 and Flash Player 9 into the PlayStation 3's web browser in firmware version 2.50.[102] Nintendo has integrated Flash Lite 3.1, equivalent to Flash 8, in the Internet Channel on the Wii.\\r\\nThe following table documents Flash Player and AIR support on mobile operating systems:\\r\\nSome CPU emulators have been created for Flash Player, including Chip8,[114] Commodore 64,[115] ZX Spectrum[116] and the Nintendo Entertainment System.[117] They enable video games created for such platforms to run within Flash Player.\\r\\nAdobe has taken steps to reduce or eliminate Flash licensing costs. For instance, the SWF file format documentation is provided free of charge[118] after they relaxed the requirement of accepting a non-disclosure agreement to view it in 2008.[119] Adobe also created the Open Screen Project which removes licensing fees and opens data protocols for Flash.\\r\\nAdobe has also open-sourced many components relating to Flash.\\r\\nHowever, Adobe has not been willing to make complete source code of the Flash Player available for free software development. Free and open source alternatives to the Adobe Flash Player such as Shumway and Gnash have been built, but are no longer under active development[128] and therefore not a viable alternative. The only fully functional open-source third-party Flash Player is the commercially available Scaleform GFx Player, which is game development middleware designed for integration into non-Flash video games.\\r\\nIn some browsers, prior Flash versions have had to be uninstalled before an updated version could be installed.[129][130] However, as of version 11.2 for Windows, there are now automatic updater options.[131] Linux is partially supported, as Adobe is cooperating with Google to implement it via Chrome web browser on all Linux platforms.[132]\\r\\nMixing Flash applications with HTML leads to inconsistent behavior with respect to input handling (keyboard and mouse not working as they would in an HTML-only document). This is often done in web sites[133] and can lead to poor user experience with the site.\\r\\nThe February 20, 2014 update to 12.0.0.70 introduced a reported bug, producing green video with sound only. This defect is related to hardware acceleration and may be overcome by disabling hardware acceleration via the Adobe settings in Firefox (accessed by right clicking within the video) or in Internet Explorer (within the Tools settings).[134] This defect may be related to widely used graphics hardware, AMD Radeon HD video cards, and similar visual defects have occurred in earlier Flash updates, with the same workaround.\\r\\nFlash Player supports persistent local storage of data (also referred to as Local Shared Objects), which can be used similarly to HTTP cookies or Web Storage in web applications. Local storage in Flash Player allows websites to store non-executable data on a user's computer, such as authentication information, game high scores or saved games, server-based session identifiers, site preferences, saved work, or temporary files. Flash Player will only allow content originating from exactly the same website domain to access data saved in local storage.[135]\\r\\nBecause local storage can be used to save information on a computer that is later retrieved by the same site, a site can use it to gather user statistics, similar to how HTTP cookies and Web Storage can be used. With such technologies, the possibility of building a profile based on user statistics is considered by some a potential privacy concern. Users can disable or restrict use of local storage in Flash Player through a \\"Settings Manager\\" page.[136][137] These settings can be accessed from the Adobe website or by right-clicking on Flash-based content and selecting \\"Global Settings\\".\\r\\nLocal storage can be disabled entirely or on a site-by-site basis. Disabling local storage will block any content from saving local user information using Flash Player, but this may disable or reduce the functionality of some websites, such as saved preferences or high scores and saved progress in games.\\r\\nFlash Player 10.1 and upward honor the privacy mode settings in the latest versions of the Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari web browsers, such that no local storage data is saved when the browser's privacy mode is in use.[138]\\r\\nAdobe security bulletins and advisories announce security updates, but Adobe Flash Player release notes do not disclose the security issues addressed when a release closes security holes, making it difficult to evaluate the urgency of a particular update. A version test page allows the user to check if the latest version is installed, and uninstallers may be used to ensure that old-version plugins have been uninstalled from all installed browsers.\\r\\nIn February 2010, Adobe officially apologized[139] for not fixing a known vulnerability for over a year. In June 2010 Adobe announced a \\"critical vulnerability\\" in recent versions, saying there are reports that this vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild against both Adobe Flash Player, and Adobe Reader and Acrobat.[140][141] Later, in October 2010, Adobe announced[142] another critical vulnerability, this time also affecting Android-based mobile devices. Android users have been recommended to disable Flash or make it only on demand.[143] Subsequent security vulnerabilities also exposed Android users, such as the two critical vulnerabilities published in February 2013[144] or the four critical vulnerabilities published in March 2013,[145] all of which could lead to arbitrary code execution.\\r\\nSymantec's Internet Security Threat Report[146] states that a remote code execution in Adobe Reader and Flash Player[147] was the second most attacked vulnerability in 2009. The same report also recommended using browser extensions to disable Flash Player usage on untrusted websites. McAfee predicted that Adobe software, especially Reader and Flash, would be primary target for attacks in 2010.[148] Adobe applications had become, at least at some point, the most popular client-software targets for attackers during the last quarter of 2009.[149] The Kaspersky Security Network published statistics for the third quarter of 2012 showing that 47.5% of its users were affected by one or more critical vulnerabilities.[150] The report also highlighted that \\"Flash Player vulnerabilities enable cybercriminals to bypass security systems integrated into the application.\\"[150]\\r\\nSteve Jobs criticized the security of Flash Player, noting that \\"Symantec recently highlighted Flash for having one of the worst security records in 2009\\".[151] Adobe responded by pointing out that \\"the Symantec Global Internet Threat Report for 2009, found that Flash Player had the second lowest number of vulnerabilities of all Internet technologies listed (which included both web plug-ins and browsers).\\"[152][153]\\r\\nApril 7, 2016, Adobe released a Flash Player patch for a zero-day memory corruption vulnerability CVE-2016-1019 that could be used to deliver malware via the Magnitude exploit kit. The vulnerability could be exploited for remote code execution.[154][155]\\r\\nFlash Player 11.2 does not play certain kinds of content unless it has been digitally signed by Adobe, following a license obtained by the publisher directly from Adobe.[156]\\r\\nThis move by Adobe, together with the abandonment of Flex to Apache was criticized as a way to lock out independent tool developers, in favor of Adobe's commercial tools.[157][158][159]\\r\\nThis has been resolved as of January 2013, after Adobe no longer requires a license or royalty from the developer. All premium features are now classified as general availability, and can be freely used by Flash applications.[160]\\r\\nIn April 2010, Steve Jobs, at the time CEO of Apple Inc. published an open letter explaining why Apple would not support Flash on the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.[151] In the letter he blamed problems with the \\"openness\\", stability, security, performance, and touchscreen integration of the Flash Player as reasons for refusing to support it. He also claimed that when one of Apple's Macintosh computers crashes, \\"more often than not\\" the cause can be attributed to Flash, and described Flash as \\"buggy\\".[161] Adobe's CEO Shantanu Narayen responded by saying, \\"If Flash [is] the number one reason that Macs crash, which I'm not aware of, it has as much to do with the Apple operating system.\\"[162]\\r\\nSteve Jobs also claimed that a large percentage of the video on the Internet is supported on iOS, since many popular video sharing websites such as YouTube have published video content in an HTML5 compatible format, enabling videos to playback in mobile web browsers even without Flash Player.[163]","input":"What is adobe flash player plugin used for?"},{"output":"The base","context":"A food web (or food cycle) is a natural interconnection of food chains and a graphical representation (usually an image) of what-eats-what in an ecological community. Another name for food web is consumer-resource system. Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels: 1) the autotrophs, and 2) the heterotrophs. To maintain their bodies, grow, develop, and to reproduce, autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances, including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide. These chemical reactions require energy, which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis, although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs. A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere, to mixotrophs (such as carnivorous plants) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere, and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter. The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory, carnivory, scavenging and parasitism. Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as sugars, provides energy. Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes, from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods, and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales.\\r\\nCharles Elton pioneered the concept of food cycles, food chains, and food size in his classical 1927 book \\"Animal Ecology\\"; Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text. Elton organized species into functional groups, which was the basis for Raymond Lindeman's classic and landmark paper in 1942 on trophic dynamics. Lindeman emphasized the important role of decomposer organisms in a trophic system of classification. The notion of a food web has a historical foothold in the writings of Charles Darwin and his terminology, including an \\"entangled bank\\", \\"web of life\\", \\"web of complex relations\\", and in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms he talked about \\"the continued movement of the particles of earth\\". Even earlier, in 1768 John Bruckner described nature as \\"one continued web of life\\".\\r\\nFood webs are limited representations of real ecosystems as they necessarily aggregate many species into trophic species, which are functional groups of species that have the same predators and prey in a food web. Ecologists use these simplifications in quantitative (or mathematical) models of trophic or consumer-resource systems dynamics. Using these models they can measure and test for generalized patterns in the structure of real food web networks. Ecologists have identified non-random properties in the topographic structure of food webs. Published examples that are used in meta analysis are of variable quality with omissions. However, the number of empirical studies on community webs is on the rise and the mathematical treatment of food webs using network theory had identified patterns that are common to all. Scaling laws, for example, predict a relationship between the topology of food web predator-prey linkages and levels of species richness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLinks in food webs map the feeding connections (who eats whom) in an ecological community. Food cycle is an obsolete term that is synonymous with food web. Ecologists can broadly group all life forms into one of two trophic layers, the autotrophs and the heterotrophs. Autotrophs produce more biomass energy, either chemically without the sun's energy or by capturing the sun's energy in photosynthesis, than they use during metabolic respiration. Heterotrophs consume rather than produce biomass energy as they metabolize, grow, and add to levels of secondary production. A food web depicts a collection of polyphagous heterotrophic consumers that network and cycle the flow of energy and nutrients from a productive base of self-feeding autotrophs.[3][4][5]\\r\\nThe base or basal species in a food web are those species without prey and can include autotrophs or saprophytic detritivores (i.e., the community of decomposers in soil, biofilms, and periphyton). Feeding connections in the web are called trophic links. The number of trophic links per consumer is a measure of food web connectance. Food chains are nested within the trophic links of food webs. Food chains are linear (noncyclic) feeding pathways that trace monophagous consumers from a base species up to the top consumer, which is usually a larger predatory carnivore.[6][7][8]\\r\\nLinkages connect to nodes in a food web, which are aggregates of biological taxa called trophic species. Trophic species are functional groups that have the same predators and prey in a food web. Common examples of an aggregated node in a food web might include parasites, microbes, decomposers, saprotrophs, consumers, or predators, each containing many species in a web that can otherwise be connected to other trophic species.[9][10]\\r\\nFood webs have trophic levels and positions. Basal species, such as plants, form the first level and are the resource limited species that feed on no other living creature in the web. Basal species can be autotrophs or detritivores, including \\"decomposing organic material and its associated microorganisms which we defined as detritus, micro-inorganic material and associated microorganisms (MIP), and vascular plant material.\\"[11]:94 Most autotrophs capture the sun's energy in chlorophyll, but some autotrophs (the chemolithotrophs) obtain energy by the chemical oxidation of inorganic compounds and can grow in dark environments, such as the sulfur bacterium Thiobacillus, which lives in hot sulfur springs. The top level has top (or apex) predators which no other species kills directly for its food resource needs. The intermediate levels are filled with omnivores that feed on more than one trophic level and cause energy to flow through a number of food pathways starting from a basal species.[12]\\r\\nIn the simplest scheme, the first trophic level (level 1) is plants, then herbivores (level 2), and then carnivores (level 3). The trophic level is equal to one more than the chain length, which is the number of links connecting to the base. The base of the food chain (primary producers or detritivores) is set at zero.[3][13] Ecologists identify feeding relations and organize species into trophic species through extensive gut content analysis of different species. The technique has been improved through the use of stable isotopes to better trace energy flow through the web.[14] It was once thought that omnivory was rare, but recent evidence suggests otherwise. This realization has made trophic classifications more complex.[15]\\r\\nThe trophic level concept was introduced in a historical landmark paper on trophic dynamics in 1942 by Raymond L. Lindeman. The basis of trophic dynamics is the transfer of energy from one part of the ecosystem to another.[13][16] The trophic dynamic concept has served as a useful quantitative heuristic, but it has several major limitations including the precision by which an organism can be allocated to a specific trophic level. Omnivores, for example, are not restricted to any single level. Nonetheless, recent research has found that discrete trophic levels do exist, but \\"above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores.\\"[15]\\r\\nA central question in the trophic dynamic literature is the nature of control and regulation over resources and production. Ecologists use simplified one trophic position food chain models (producer, carnivore, decomposer). Using these models, ecologists have tested various types of ecological control mechanisms. For example, herbivores generally have an abundance of vegetative resources, which meant that their populations were largely controlled or regulated by predators. This is known as the top-down hypothesis or 'green-world' hypothesis. Alternatively to the top-down hypothesis, not all plant material is edible and the nutritional quality or antiherbivore defenses of plants (structural and chemical) suggests a bottom-up form of regulation or control.[17][18][19] Recent studies have concluded that both \\"top-down\\" and \\"bottom-up\\" forces can influence community structure and the strength of the influence is environmentally context dependent.[20][21] These complex multitrophic interactions involve more than two trophic levels in a food web.[22]\\r\\nAnother example of a multi-trophic interaction is a trophic cascade, in which predators help to increase plant growth and prevent overgrazing by suppressing herbivores. Links in a food-web illustrate direct trophic relations among species, but there are also indirect effects that can alter the abundance, distribution, or biomass in the trophic levels. For example, predators eating herbivores indirectly influence the control and regulation of primary production in plants. Although the predators do not eat the plants directly, they regulate the population of herbivores that are directly linked to plant trophism. The net effect of direct and indirect relations is called trophic cascades. Trophic cascades are separated into species-level cascades, where only a subset of the food-web dynamic is impacted by a change in population numbers, and community-level cascades, where a change in population numbers has a dramatic effect on the entire food-web, such as the distribution of plant biomass.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nFood webs depict energy flow via trophic linkages. Energy flow is directional, which contrasts against the cyclic flows of material through the food web systems.[26] Energy flow \\"typically includes production, consumption, assimilation, non-assimilation losses (feces), and respiration (maintenance costs).\\"[5]:5 In a very general sense, energy flow (E) can be defined as the sum of metabolic production (P) and respiration (R), such that E=P+R.\\r\\nBiomass represents stored energy. However, concentration and quality of nutrients and energy is variable. Many plant fibers, for example, are indigestible to many herbivores leaving grazer community food webs more nutrient limited than detrital food webs where bacteria are able to access and release the nutrient and energy stores.[27][28] \\"Organisms usually extract energy in the form of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These polymers have a dual role as supplies of energy as well as building blocks; the part that functions as energy supply results in the production of nutrients (and carbon dioxide, water, and heat). Excretion of nutrients is, therefore, basic to metabolism.\\"[28]:1230ÿ1231 The units in energy flow webs are typically a measure mass or energy per m2 per unit time. Different consumers are going to have different metabolic assimilation efficiencies in their diets. Each trophic level transforms energy into biomass. Energy flow diagrams illustrate the rates and efficiency of transfer from one trophic level into another and up through the hierarchy.[29][30]\\r\\nIt is the case that the biomass of each trophic level decreases from the base of the chain to the top. This is because energy is lost to the environment with each transfer as entropy increases. About eighty to ninety percent of the energy is expended for the organisms life processes or is lost as heat or waste. Only about ten to twenty percent of the organisms energy is generally passed to the next organism.[31] The amount can be less than one percent in animals consuming less digestible plants, and it can be as high as forty percent in zooplankton consuming phytoplankton.[32] Graphic representations of the biomass or productivity at each tropic level are called ecological pyramids or trophic pyramids. The transfer of energy from primary producers to top consumers can also be characterized by energy flow diagrams.[33]\\r\\nA common metric used to quantify food web trophic structure is food chain length. Food chain length is another way of describing food webs as a measure of the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from the plants to top predators.[34]:269 There are different ways of calculating food chain length depending on what parameters of the food web dynamic are being considered: connectance, energy, or interaction.[34] In its simplest form, the length of a chain is the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the web. The mean chain length of an entire web is the arithmetic average of the lengths of all chains in a food web.[35][12]\\r\\nIn a simple predator-prey example, a deer is one step removed from the plants it eats (chain length = 1) and a wolf that eats the deer is two steps removed from the plants (chain length = 2). The relative amount or strength of influence that these parameters have on the food web address questions about:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a pyramid of numbers, the number of consumers at each level decreases significantly, so that a single top consumer, (e.g., a polar bear or a human), will be supported by a much larger number of separate producers. There is usually a maximum of four or five links in a food chain, although food chains in aquatic ecosystems are more often longer than those on land. Eventually, all the energy in a food chain is dispersed as heat.[4]\\r\\nEcological pyramids place the primary producers at the base. They can depict different numerical properties of ecosystems, including numbers of individuals per unit of area, biomass (g/m2), and energy (k cal m?2 yr?1). The emergent pyramidal arrangement of trophic levels with amounts of energy transfer decreasing as species become further removed from the source of production is one of several patterns that is repeated amongst the planets ecosystems.[2]\\\\[3][38] The size of each level in the pyramid generally represents biomass, which can be measured as the dry weight of an organism.[39] Autotrophs may have the highest global proportion of biomass, but they are closely rivaled or surpassed by microbes.[40][41]\\r\\nPyramid structure can vary across ecosystems and across time. In some instances biomass pyramids can be inverted. This pattern is often identified in aquatic and coral reef ecosystems. The pattern of biomass inversion is attributed to different sizes of producers. Aquatic communities are often dominated by producers that are smaller than the consumers that have high growth rates. Aquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of secondary growth as exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.[42] Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted. Energy pyramids, however, will always have an upright pyramid shape if all sources of food energy are included and this is dictated by the second law of thermodynamics.[4][43]\\r\\nMany of the Earth's elements and minerals (or mineral nutrients) are contained within the tissues and diets of organisms. Hence, mineral and nutrient cycles trace food web energy pathways. Ecologists employ stoichiometry to analyze the ratios of the main elements found in all organisms: carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P). There is a large transitional difference between many terrestrial and aquatic systems as C:P and C:N ratios are much higher in terrestrial systems while N:P ratios are equal between the two systems.[44][45][46] Mineral nutrients are the material resources that organisms need for growth, development, and vitality. Food webs depict the pathways of mineral nutrient cycling as they flow through organisms.[4][16] Most of the primary production in an ecosystem is not consumed, but is recycled by detritus back into useful nutrients.[47] Many of the Earth's microorganisms are involved in the formation of minerals in a process called biomineralization.[48][49][50] Bacteria that live in detrital sediments create and cycle nutrients and biominerals.[51] Food web models and nutrient cycles have traditionally been treated separately, but there is a strong functional connection between the two in terms of stability, flux, sources, sinks, and recycling of mineral nutrients.[52][53]\\r\\nFood webs are necessarily aggregated and only illustrate a tiny portion of the complexity of real ecosystems. For example, the number of species on the planet are likely in the general order of 107, over 95% of these species consist of microbes and invertebrates, and relatively few have been named or classified by taxonomists.[54][55][56] It is explicitly understood that natural systems are 'sloppy' and that food web trophic positions simplify the complexity of real systems that sometimes overemphasize many rare interactions. Most studies focus on the larger influences where the bulk of energy transfer occurs.[17] \\"These omissions and problems are causes for concern, but on present evidence do not present insurmountable difficulties.\\"[3]:669\\r\\nThere are different kinds or categories of food webs:\\r\\nWithin these categories, food webs can be further organized according to the different kinds of ecosystems being investigated. For example, human food webs, agricultural food webs, detrital food webs, marine food webs, aquatic food webs, soil food webs, Arctic (or polar) food webs, terrestrial food webs, and microbial food webs. These characterizations stem from the ecosystem concept, which assumes that the phenomena under investigation (interactions and feedback loops) are sufficient to explain patterns within boundaries, such as the edge of a forest, an island, a shoreline, or some other pronounced physical characteristic.[59][60][61]\\r\\nIn a detrital web, plant and animal matter is broken down by decomposers, e.g., bacteria and fungi, and moves to detritivores and then carnivores.[62] There are often relationships between the detrital web and the grazing web. Mushrooms produced by decomposers in the detrital web become a food source for deer, squirrels, and mice in the grazing web. Earthworms eaten by robins are detritivores consuming decaying leaves.[63]\\r\\n\\"Detritus can be broadly defined as any form of non-living organic matter, including different types of plant tissue (e.g. leaf litter, dead wood, aquatic macrophytes, algae), animal tissue (carrion), dead microbes, faeces (manure, dung, faecal pellets, guano, frass), as well as products secreted, excreted or exuded from organisms (e.g. extra-cellular polymers, nectar, root exudates and leachates, dissolved organic matter, extra-cellular matrix, mucilage). The relative importance of these forms of detritus, in terms of origin, size and chemical composition, varies across ecosystems.\\"[47]:585\\r\\nEcologists collect data on trophic levels and food webs to statistically model and mathematically calculate parameters, such as those used in other kinds of network analysis (e.g., graph theory), to study emergent patterns and properties shared among ecosystems. There are different ecological dimensions that can be mapped to create more complicated food webs, including: species composition (type of species), richness (number of species), biomass (the dry weight of plants and animals), productivity (rates of conversion of energy and nutrients into growth), and stability (food webs over time). A food web diagram illustrating species composition shows how change in a single species can directly and indirectly influence many others. Microcosm studies are used to simplify food web research into semi-isolated units such as small springs, decaying logs, and laboratory experiments using organisms that reproduce quickly, such as daphnia feeding on algae grown under controlled environments in jars of water.[36][64]\\r\\nWhile the complexity of real food webs connections are difficult to decipher, ecologists have found mathematical models on networks an invaluable tool for gaining insight into the structure, stability, and laws of food web behaviours relative to observable outcomes. \\"Food web theory centers around the idea of connectance.\\"[65]:1648 Quantitative formulas simplify the complexity of food web structure. The number of trophic links (tL), for example, is converted into a connectance value:\\r\\nwhere, S(S-1)/2 is the maximum number of binary connections among S species.[65] \\"Connectance (C) is the fraction of all possible links that are realized (L/S2) and represents a standard measure of food web complexity...\\"[66]:12913 The distance (d) between every species pair in a web is averaged to compute the mean distance between all nodes in a web (D)[66] and multiplied by the total number of links (L) to obtain link-density (LD), which is influenced by scale dependent variables such as species richness. These formulas are the basis for comparing and investigating the nature of non-random patterns in the structure of food web networks among many different types of ecosystems.[66][67]\\r\\nScaling laws, complexity, choas, and patterned correlates are common features attributed to food web structure.[68][69]\\r\\nFood webs are complex. Complexity is a measure of an increasing number of permutations and it is also a metaphorical term that conveys the mental intractability or limits concerning unlimited algorithmic possibilities. In food web terminology, complexity is a product of the number of species and connectance.[70][71][72] Connectance is \\"the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network\\".[73]:12917 These concepts were derived and stimulated through the suggestion that complexity leads to stability in food webs, such as increasing the number of trophic levels in more species rich ecosystems. This hypothesis was challenged through mathematical models suggesting otherwise, but subsequent studies have shown that the premise holds in real systems.[70][74]\\r\\nAt different levels in the hierarchy of life, such as the stability of a food web, \\"the same overall structure is maintained in spite of an ongoing flow and change of components.\\"[75]:476 The farther a living system (e.g., ecosystem) sways from equilibrium, the greater its complexity.[75] Complexity has multiple meanings in the life sciences and in the public sphere that confuse its application as a precise term for analytical purposes in science.[72][76] Complexity in the life sciences (or biocomplexity) is defined by the \\"properties emerging from the interplay of behavioral, biological, physical, and social interactions that affect, sustain, or are modified by living organisms, including humans\\".[77]:1018\\r\\nSeveral concepts have emerged from the study of complexity in food webs. Complexity explains many principals pertaining to self-organization, non-linearity, interaction, cybernetic feedback, discontinuity, emergence, and stability in food webs. Nestedness, for example, is defined as \\"a pattern of interaction in which specialists interact with species that form perfect subsets of the species with which generalists interact\\",[78]:575 \\"that is, the diet of the most specialized species is a subset of the diet of the next more generalized species, and its diet a subset of the next more generalized, and so on.\\"[79] Until recently, it was thought that food webs had little nested structure, but empirical evidence shows that many published webs have nested subwebs in their assembly.[80]\\r\\nFood webs are complex networks. As networks, they exhibit similar structural properties and mathematical laws that have been used to describe other complex systems, such as small world and scale free properties. The small world attribute refers to the many loosely connected nodes, non-random dense clustering of a few nodes (i.e., trophic or keystone species in ecology), and small path length compared to a regular lattice.[73][81] \\"Ecological networks, especially mutualistic networks, are generally very heterogeneous, consisting of areas with sparse links among species and distinct areas of tightly linked species. These regions of high link density are often referred to as cliques, hubs, compartments, cohesive sub-groups, or modules...Within food webs, especially in aquatic systems, nestedness appears to be related to body size because the diets of smaller predators tend to be nested subsets of those of larger predators (Woodward & Warren 2007; YvonDurocher et al. 2008), and phylogenetic constraints, whereby related taxa are nested based on their common evolutionary history, are also evident (Cattin et al. 2004).\\"[82]:257 \\"Compartments in food webs are subgroups of taxa in which many strong interactions occur within the subgroups and few weak interactions occur between the subgroups. Theoretically, compartments increase the stability in networks, such as food webs.\\"[58]\\r\\nFood webs are also complex in the way that they change in scale, seasonally, and geographically. The components of food webs, including organisms and mineral nutrients, cross the thresholds of ecosystem boundaries. This has led to the concept or area of study known as cross-boundary subsidy.[59][60] \\"This leads to anomalies, such as food web calculations determining that an ecosystem can support one half of a top carnivore, without specifying which end.\\"[61] Nonetheless, real differences in structure and function have been identified when comparing different kinds of ecological food webs, such as terrestrial vs. aquatic food webs.[83]\\r\\nFood webs serve as a framework to help ecologists organize the complex network of interactions among species observed in nature and around the world. One of the earliest descriptions of a food chain was described by a medieval Afro-Arab scholar named Al-Jahiz: \\"All animals, in short, cannot exist without food, neither can the hunting animal escape being hunted in his turn.\\"[84]:143 The earliest graphical depiction of a food web was by Lorenzo Camerano in 1880, followed independently by those of Pierce and colleagues in 1912 and Victor Shelford in 1913.[85][86] Two food webs about herring were produced by Victor Summerhayes and Charles Elton[87] and Alister Hardy[88] in 1923 and 1924. Charles Elton subsequently pioneered the concept of food cycles, food chains, and food size in his classical 1927 book \\"Animal Ecology\\"; Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text.[89] After Charles Elton's use of food webs in his 1927 synthesis,[90] they became a central concept in the field of ecology. Elton[89] organized species into functional groups, which formed the basis for the trophic system of classification in Raymond Lindeman's classic and landmark paper in 1942 on trophic dynamics.[16][37][91] The notion of a food web has a historical foothold in the writings of Charles Darwin and his terminology, including an \\"entangled bank\\", \\"web of life\\", \\"web of complex relations\\", and in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms he talked about \\"the continued movement of the particles of earth\\". Even earlier, in 1768 John Bruckner described nature as \\"one continued web of life\\".[3][92][93][94]\\r\\nInterest in food webs increased after Robert Paine's experimental and descriptive study of intertidal shores[95] suggesting that food web complexity was key to maintaining species diversity and ecological stability. Many theoretical ecologists, including Sir Robert May[96] and Stuart Pimm,[97] were prompted by this discovery and others to examine the mathematical properties of food webs.","input":"Where are producers located on the food chain?"},{"output":"during the 20th century","context":"A wedding ring or wedding band is a finger ring that indicates that its wearer is married.[1] It is usually forged from metal, and traditionally is forged of gold or another precious metal.[2]\\r\\nThe earliest examples of wedding rings are from Ancient Egypt. Western customs for wedding rings can be traced to ancient Rome and Greece, and were transmitted to the present through Christendom in Europe, which adapted the ancient customs.\\r\\nDepending on culture, a wedding ring is typically worn on the base of the left or right ring finger. Many spouses wear their wedding rings day and night, causing an indentation in the skin that is visible even when the ring is removed. Another indication of their cultural importance is that wedding rings are among the few items that prison inmates and visitors are permitted to wear[where?].[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is commonly believed that the first examples of wedding rings were found in ancient Egypt. Relics dating to 6,000 years ago, including papyrus scrolls, are evidence of the exchange of braided rings of hemp or reeds between spouses. Ancient Egypt considered the circle to be a symbol of eternity, and the ring served to signify the perpetual love of the spouses. This was also the origin of the custom of wearing the wedding ring on the ring finger of the left hand, because the ancient Egyptians believed that this finger enclosed a special vein that was connected directly to the heart,[5] denominated in Latin the \\"Vena amoris\\".\\r\\nThe Western traditions of wedding rings can be traced to ancient Rome and Greece, and were first associated with the marital dowry and later with a promise of fidelity. The modern exchange of rings derived from the customs of Europe in the Middle Ages as part of Christendom.[6] In the United States, wedding rings were initially only worn by wives, but became customary for both husbands and wives during the 20th century.[7]\\r\\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, European husbands bestowed a gimmel ring upon their wives. Similar to the puzzle ring, the gimmel ring consisted of two interlocking bands. The bride and groom both wore one of these bands after their engagement, and the two bands were reunited during the wedding ceremony. Subsequently, the wife wore the combined ring.[5]\\r\\nThe poesy ring was a style of ring that was popular during the Renaissance era. It was a band of sterling silver inscribed with a poem or \\"poesy\\".[5]\\r\\nDifferent cultures used many other historical styles of wedding ring. For example, see the image below of the Byzantine ring depicting Christ uniting bride and groom. Also, in the Middle East the puzzle ring was a historical custom: this ring consisted of several pieces that joined together into a cohesive band when worn properly. The object of this style of ring was to render it very difficult to put on the finger properly such that, if the wife removed it, her husband would know. The fede ring, being a band consisting of two hands clasped in betrothal, is another historical custom of Europe that ostensibly dates from antiquity.\\r\\nIn 1942 during the Second World War, British wartime restrictions on the manufacture of jewelry resulted in \\"utility\\" wedding rings that were limited to a maximum mass of two pennyweights, being slightly heavier than 3 grams, and were forged of 9 carat gold rather than the traditional 22 carat.[8] The Regional Assayer Office hallmarked these rings, which guaranteed their gold content and compliance with the wartime regulations with a special utility mark adjacent to the mark for the year on the inside of the band; the hallmark resembled a capital \\"U\\" with the bottom curve absent or two parentheses enclosing a space, i. e., \\"( )\\".\\r\\nThe double-ring ceremony describes the exchange of wedding rings by and for both spouses. In several European nations such as the Nordic countries, it is common to exchange plain engagement rings of the same form for both sexes, and typically, an additional, more precious, and bejeweled wedding ring is given to the bride. In the nuptials, the groom's ring becomes a wedding ring also, and can be bestowed anew by the bride as a part of the wedding ceremony. The engagement is commonly a matter of agreement between the two, and the wedding rings are chosen together. Both engagement and wedding rings are worn on the left hand, the bride having both rings together. Occasionally, the groom receives a separate wedding ring. In Germany and Austria, both parties use engagement rings worn on the left hand. At the nuptials, a wedding ring is placed on the right hand, as in several east European nations, including Bulgaria, Poland, and Russia. This can be a new ring for the bride or both, or reusing the engagement rings. Any engagement rings can then remain on the left hand or be transferred to the right hand. In Germany, in has been customary for both the bride and the groom to wear a wedding ring since at least the 1870s[9] and mentions of couples exchange rings during the wedding ceremony in the Netherlands can be found at least as far back as 1815.[10] In Brazil, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Spain both sexes also wear engagement rings, and the groom's ring often becomes a wedding ring in the nuptial exchange ceremony.\\r\\nIn Western nations, wedding rings are often forged of rose, white, or yellow gold; palladium, platinum, argentium silver, or, more recently, silicone.[11][12] The perpetuity of noble metals symbolizes the permanence of the marriage. Common engravings on the inside of the ring include the name of one's spouse, the names of both spouses, the date of the wedding, and/or a phrase of significance to the spouses.[13] In many nations the engagement rings are plain while the bride's wedding ring commonly is bejeweled.\\r\\nSome customs include the wedding ring as the final of a series of gifts, which also may include the engagement ring, traditionally given as a betrothal present. This custom was practiced in ancient Rome and is possibly much older.[14]\\r\\nIn several traditions, the best man or maid of honour has the duty of keeping track of a couple's wedding rings and to produce them at the symbolic moment of the giving and receiving of the rings during the traditional marriage ceremony. In more elaborate weddings, a ring bearer (who is often part of the family of the bride or groom) may assist in the ceremonial parading of the rings into the ceremony, sometimes on a special cushion.\\r\\nAmong Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Christians, the exchange of rings is not technically part of the wedding service, but rather are exchanged at the betrothal. It is always a two-ring set given to her by the priest or by the best man.[14] The orthodox Christian Church of Greece has recently stopped performing betrothal blessings separately, as these were often non-committing, and now a betrothal ceremony is the initial part of the wedding service. In many families an informal blessing is now performed by the betrothed ones' parents in a family dinner that formalizes the betrothal. The ceremony of betrothal is now possibly performed immediately before the wedding (or \\"crowning\\" as it is more properly called), and the actual symbolic act of marriage is not the exchange of rings, but the crowning.\\r\\nHistorically, the wedding ring was connected to the exchange of valuables at the moment of the wedding rather than a symbol of eternal love and devotion, a sign of \\"earnest money\\". According to the 1549 edition of the Book of Common Prayer: after the words 'with this ring I thee wed' follow the words 'This gold and silver I give thee', at which point the groom was supposed to hand a leather purse filled with gold and silver coins to the bride.[15] It is a relic of the times when marriage was a contract between families, not individual lovers. Both families were then eager to ensure the economic safety of the young couple. Sometimes it went as far as being a conditional exchange as this old (and today outdated) German formula shows: 'I give you this ring as a sign of the marriage which has been promised between us, provided your father gives with you a marriage portion of 1000 Reichsthalers'.[15]\\r\\nModernly, after marriage the wedding ring is worn on the hand on which it had been placed during the ceremony. By wearing rings on their fourth fingers, married spouses symbolically declare their life-long love for and fidelity to each other. This symbol has public utility, and is presently expected as a matter of tradition and etiquette, so much so that its absence is often interpreted as meaning that the person is single. Many spouses wear their wedding rings day and night. When needed because of hygiene or to avoid damage, they commonly wear their rings on a necklace.\\r\\nSome cultures exchange additional rings: In some parts of India, Hindu women may wear a toe ring or \\"bichiya\\" instead of a finger ring, but the bichiya is increasingly worn in addition to a finger ring. In eastern India, primarily in West Bengal, women wear an iron bangle denominated a \\"loha\\". Increasingly, this bangle is plated with gold or silver to improve its appearance. In Romania, spouses celebrate their silver wedding anniversary, i. e., twenty-fifth anniversary, by exchanging silver wedding rings, which are worn on the fourth finger of the left hands along with their original, and usually gold, wedding rings.[16][17]","input":"When did man first start wearing wedding rings?"},{"output":"527,438","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nFresno\\r\\n\\r\\nFresno (/?fr?zno?/ FREZ-noh; Spanish for \\"ash tree\\") is a city in California, United States, and the county seat of Fresno County.

It lies approximately 220 miles (350?km) north of Los Angeles, 170 miles (270?km) south of the state capital, Sacramento, and 185 miles (300?km) southeast of San Francisco. Yosemite National Park is about 60 miles (100?km) to the north, Kings Canyon National Park is 60 miles (100?km) to the east, and Sequoia National Park is 75 miles (120?km) to the southeast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original inhabitants of the San Joaquin Valley region were the Yokuts people and Miwok people, who engaged in trading with other Californian tribes of Native Americans including coastal peoples such as the Chumash of the Central California coast, with whom they are thought to have traded plant and animal products.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first European to enter the San Joaquin Valley was Pedro Fages in 1772.[14] The county of Fresno was formed in 1856 after the California Gold Rush. It was named for the abundant ash trees (Spanish: fresno) lining the San Joaquin River. The county was much larger than it is today as part of Tulare County, comprising its current area plus all of what became Madera County and parts of what are now San Benito, Kings, Inyo, and Mono counties.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMillerton, then on the banks of the free-flowing San Joaquin River and close to Fort Miller, became the county seat after becoming a focal point for settlers. Other early county settlements included Firebaugh's Ferry, Scottsburg and Elkhorn Springs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe San Joaquin River flooded on December 24, 1867, inundating Millerton. Some residents rebuilt, others moved. Flooding also destroyed the town of Scottsburg on the nearby Kings River that winter. Rebuilt on higher ground, Scottsburg was renamed Centerville.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1867, Anthony \\"McQeen\\" Easterby purchased land bounded by the present Chestnut, Belmont, Clovis and California avenues, that today is called the Sunnyside district. Unable to grow wheat for lack of water, he hired sheep man Moses J. Church in 1871 to create an irrigation system.[citation needed] Building new canals and purchasing existing ditches, Church then formed the Fresno Canal and Irrigation Company, a predecessor of the Fresno Irrigation District.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1872, the Central Pacific Railroad established a station near Easterby'sby now a hugely productive wheat farmfor its new Southern Pacific line. Soon there was a store around the station and the store grew into the town of Fresno Station, later called Fresno. Many Millerton residents, drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding, moved to the new community. Fresno became an incorporated city in 1885. By 1931 the Fresno Traction Company operated 47 streetcars over 49 miles of track.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1877, William Helm made Fresno his home with a five-acre tract of land at the corner of Fresno and R streets. Helm was the largest individual sheep grower in Fresno County. In carrying his wool to market at Stockton, he used three wagons, each drawn by ten mules, and spent twelve days in making the round trip.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years after the station was established, county residents voted to move the county seat from Millerton to Fresno. When the Friant Dam was completed in 1944, the site of Millerton became inundated by the waters of Millerton Lake. In extreme droughts, when the reservoir shrinks, ruins of the original county seat can still be observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the nineteenth century, with so much wooden construction and in the absence of sophisticated firefighting resources, fires often ravaged American frontier towns. The greatest of Fresno's early-day fires, in 1882, destroyed an entire block of the city. Another devastating blaze struck in 1883.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1909, Fresno's first and oldest synagogue, Temple Beth Israel, was founded.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresno entered the ranks of the 100 most populous cities in the United States in 1960 with a population of 134,000. Thirty years later, in the 1990 census, it moved up to 47th place with 354,000, and in the census of 2000, it achieved 37th place with 428,000.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fresno Municipal Sanitary Landfill was the first modern landfill in the United States, and incorporated several important innovations to waste disposal, including trenching, compacting, and the daily covering of trash with dirt. It was opened in 1937 and closed in 1987. Today, it has the unusual distinction of being a National Historic Landmark as well as a Superfund site.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore World War II, Fresno had many ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Armenia, German Town, Little Italy, and Chinatown. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported Fresno's population as 94.0% white, 3.3% black and 2.7% Asian.[20] (Incongruously, Chinatown was primarily a Japanese neighborhood and today Japanese-American businesses still remain). During 1942, Pinedale, in what is now North Fresno, was the site of the Pinedale Assembly Center, an interim facility for the relocation of Fresno area Japanese Americans to internment camps.[21] The Fresno Fairgrounds were also utilized as an assembly center.\\r\\n\\r\\nRow crops and orchards gave way to urban development particularly in the period after World War II; this transition was particularly vividly demonstrated in locations such as the Blackstone Avenue corridor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1958, Bank of America launched a new product called BankAmericard in Fresno. After a troubled gestation during which its creator resigned, BankAmericard went on to become the first successful credit card; that is, a financial instrument that was usable across a large number of merchants and also allowed cardholders to revolve a balance (earlier financial products could do one or the other but not both). In 1976, BankAmericard was renamed and spun off into a separate company known today as Visa Inc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dance style commonly known as popping evolved in Fresno in the 1970s.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1970s, the city was the subject of a song, \\"Walking Into Fresno\\", written by Hall Of Fame guitarist Bill Aken and recorded by Bob Gallion of the world-famous \\"WWVA Jamboree\\" radio and television show in Wheeling, West Virginia. Aken, adopted by Mexican-American movie actress Lupe Mayorga, grew up in the neighboring town of Madera and his song chronicled the hardships faced by the migrant farm workers he saw as a child. Aken also made his first TV appearance playing guitar on the old country-western show at The Fresno Barn.\\r\\n\\r\\nFictional residents of the town were portrayed in a 1986 comedic miniseries titled \\"Fresno\\", featuring Carol Burnett, Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr and Charles Grodin, along with numerous other celebrities. The mini series was presented as a parody of the prime time soap operas popular in the 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Operation Rezone sting resulted in several prominent Fresno and Clovis politicians being charged in connection with taking bribes in return for rezoning farmland for housing developments. Before the sting brought a halt to it, housing developers could buy farmland cheaply, pay off council members to have it rezoned, and make a large profit building and selling inexpensive housing. Sixteen people were eventually convicted as a result of the sting.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nFresno is at 364452N 1194621W? / ?36.74778N 119.77250W? / 36.74778; -119.77250.[24] having a total area of 112.3 square miles (291?km2) with 99.69% land covering 112.0 square miles (290?km2), and 0.31% water, 0.4 square miles (1.0?km2).\\r\\n\\r\\nFresno's location, very near the geographical center of California, places the city a comfortable distance from several of the major recreation areas and urban centers in the state. Just 60?mi (97?km) south of Yosemite National Park, it is the nearest major city to the park. Likewise, Sierra National Forest is 40?mi (64?km), Kings Canyon National Park is 60?mi (97?km) and Sequoia National Park is 75?mi (121?km). The city is located near some beautiful Sierra Nevada lakes including Bass Lake, Shaver Lake, and Huntington Lake. Fresno is also only two and a half hours from Monterey, Carmel, Big Sur and the central coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Fresno sits at the junction of Highways 41 and 99 (41 is Yosemite National Park's southern access road, and 99 branches east from Interstate 5 to serve the urban centers of the San Joaquin Valley), the city is a major gateway for Yosemite visitors coming from Los Angeles. The city also serves as an entrance into Sierra National Forest via highway 168, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks via Highway 180.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresno has three large public parks, two in the city limits and one in county land to the southwest. Woodward Park, which features the Shinzen Japanese Gardens, numerous picnic areas and several miles of trails, is in North Fresno and is adjacent to the San Joaquin River Parkway. Roeding Park, near Downtown Fresno, is home to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo, and Rotary Storyland and Playland. Kearney Park is the largest of the Fresno region's park system and is home to historic Kearney Mansion and plays host to the annual Civil War Revisited, the largest reenactment of the Civil War in the west coast of the U.S.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land, a national land conservation organization, reported that Fresno had the worst park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities.[27] The survey measures median park size, park acres as percent of city area, residents' access to parks, spending on parks per resident, and playgrounds per 10,000 residents.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresno was born with the establishment of the then Central Pacific Railroad Depot in 1872. In 1889 Southern Pacific Railroad, which had acquired Central Pacific, constructed a new depot on the original depot site. The brick Queen Anne style depot was a jewel for the city and is currently one of Fresno's oldest standing buildings. In 1971, 99 years after it first opened for business on its current site, the Depot closed its rail operations due to the decline in business.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the 1880s and World War II, Downtown Fresno flourished, filled with electric Street Cars,[29] and contained some of the San Joaquin Valley's most beautiful architectural buildings.[30] Among them, the original Fresno County Courthouse (demolished), the Fresno Carnegie Public Library (demolished), the Fresno Water Tower, the Bank of Italy Building, the Pacific Southwest Building, the San Joaquin Light and Power Building (currently known as the Grand 1401), and the Hughes Hotel (burned down), to name a few.\\r\\n\\r\\nFulton Street in Downtown Fresno was Fresno's main financial and commercial district before being converted into one of the nation's first pedestrian malls in 1964.[31] Renamed the Fulton Mall, the area contains the densest collection of historic buildings in Fresno. While the Fulton Mall corridor has suffered a sharp decline from its heyday, the Mall includes some of the finest public art pieces in the country, including a casting of Pierre-Auguste Renoir's bronze \\"The Washer Woman\\", reportedly the only one of the six castings that one can walk up to and touch. Current plans call for the reopening of the Fulton Mall to automobile traffic. The public art pieces will be restored and placed near their current locations and will feature wide sidewalks (up to 28' on the east side of the street) to continue with the pedestrian friendly environment of the district.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood of Sunnyside is on Fresno's far southeast side, bounded by Chestnut Avenue to the West. Its major thoroughfares are Kings Canyon Avenue and Clovis Avenue. Although parts of Sunnyside are within the City of Fresno, much of the neighborhood is a \\"county island\\" within Fresno County. Largely developed in the 1950s through the 1970s, it has recently experienced a surge in new home construction. It is also the home of the Sunnyside Country Club, which maintains a golf course designed by William P. Bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popular neighborhood known as the Tower District is centered around the historic Tower Theatre, which is included on the National List of Historic Places.[33] The theater was built in 1939 and is at Olive and Wishon Avenues in the heart of the Tower District. (The name of the theater refers to a well-known landmark water tower, which is actually in another nearby area). The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper, and one-half mile south of Fresno City College.[34] Although the neighborhood was previously known as a residential area, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II. The character of small local businesses largely remains today. To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School, (later renamed California State University at Fresno). In 1916 the college moved to what is now the site of Fresno City College one-half mile north[35] of the Tower District.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis vibrant and culturally diverse area of retail businesses and residences experienced a renewal after a significant decline in the late 1960s and 1970s.[citation needed] After decades of neglect and suburban flight, the neighborhood revival followed the re-opening of the Tower Theatre in the late 1970s, which at that time showed second and third run movies, along with classic films. Roger Rocka's Dinner Theater & Good Company Players also opened nearby in 1978,[36] at Olive and Wishon Avenues. Fresno native Audra McDonald performed in the leading roles of Evita and The Wiz at the theater while she was a high school student. McDonald subsequently became a leading performer on Broadway in New York City and a Tony award-winning actress. Also in the Tower District is Good Company Players' 2nd Space Theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tower District is a hub for community events such as Jamaica My Weekend, Mardi Gras in February, Gay Pride Parade, car shows, A Taste of The Tower, Halloween in the Tower, and the Farmer's Market opened on the North-West Corner of Olive and Van Ness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood features restaurants, live theater and nightclubs, as well as several independent shops and bookstores, currently operating on or near Olive Avenue, and all within a few hundred feet of each other. Since renewal, the Tower District has become an attractive area for restaurant and other local businesses. Today, the Tower District is also known as the center of Fresno's LGBT and hipster Communities.;[37] Additionally, Tower District is also known as the center of Fresno's local punk/goth/deathrock and heavy metal community.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area is also known for its early twentieth century homes, many of which have been restored in recent decades. The area includes many California Bungalow and American Craftsman style homes, Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture, Mediterranean Revival Style architecture, Mission Revival Style architecture, and many Storybook houses designed by Fresno architects, Hilliard, Taylor & Wheeler. The residential architecture of the Tower District contrasts with the newer areas of tract homes urban sprawl in north and east areas of Fresno.\\r\\n\\r\\nHomes from the early 20th century line this boulevard in the heart of the historic Alta Vista Tract. The section of Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately homes. The original development of this area began circa 1910, on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field. The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the city in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the city, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes. This rapid development was no doubt hastened by the Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surrounding streets, Kerckhoff and Balch Avenues (which are part of the original Alta Vista tract), have homes from the Arts and Crafts era, which, like the downtown, are being renovated and brought back to their historic roots. During Christmas, the homes along the boulevard are adorned with lights and decorations. The nation's tallest living Christmas Tree, at Huntington and 6th Street, is the highlight of the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuntington Boulevard has been referred to as Fresno's \\"anti-gated community\\".[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth of Shaw Avenue, Van Ness continues as the Van Ness Extension, between Marks Avenue and West Avenue. Van Ness Extension is considered the most prestigious neighborhood in the city, and boasts some of Fresno's most elaborate homes and most affluent citizens.  Residents include many notable doctors, business owners, entrepreneurs, and stock traders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"West Side\\" of Fresno, also often called \\"Southwest Fresno\\", is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city. The neighborhood lies southwest of the 99 freeway (which divides it from Downtown Fresno), west of the 41 freeway and south of Nielsen Ave (or the newly constructed 180 Freeway), and extends to the city limits to the west and south. The neighborhood is traditionally considered to be the center of Fresno's African-American community. It is culturally diverse and also includes significant Mexican-American and Asian-American (principally Hmong or Laotian) populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighborhood includes Kearney Boulevard, named after early 20th century entrepreneur and millionaire M. Theo Kearney, which extends from Fresno Street in Southwest Fresno about 20?mi (32?km) west to Kerman, California. A small, two-lane rural road for most of its length, Kearney Boulevard is lined with tall palm trees. The roughly half-mile stretch of Kearney Boulevard between Fresno Street and Thorne Ave was at one time the preferred neighborhood for Fresno's elite African-American families. Another section, Brookhaven, on the southern edge of the West Side south of Jensen and west of Elm, was given the name by the Fresno City Council in an effort to revitalize the neighborhood's image. The isolated subdivision was for years known as the \\"Dogg Pound\\" in reference to a local gang, and as of late 2008 was still known for high levels of violent crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile many homes in the neighborhood date back to the 1930s or before, the neighborhood is also home to several public housing developments built between the 1960s and 1990s by the Fresno Housing Authority. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development has also built small subdivisions of single-family homes in the area for purchase by low-income working families. There have been numerous attempts to revitalize the neighborhood, including the construction of a modern shopping center on the corner of Fresno and B streets, an aborted attempt to build luxury homes and a golf course on the western edge of the neighborhood, and some new section 8 apartments have been built along Church Ave west of Elm St. Cargill Meat Solutions and Foster Farms both have large processing facilities in the neighborhood, and the stench from these (and other small industrial facilities) has long plagued area residents. The Fresno Chandler Executive Airport is also on the West Side. Due to its position on the edge of the city and years of neglect by developers, it is not a true \\"inner-city\\" neighborhood, and there are many vacant lots, strawberry fields and vineyards throughout the neighborhood. The neighborhood has very little retail activity, aside from the area near Fresno Street and State Route 99 Freeway (Kearney Palm Shopping Center, built in the late 1990s) and small corner markets scattered throughout.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the north eastern part of Fresno, Woodward Park was founded by the late Ralph Woodward, a long-time Fresno resident. He bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park and bird sanctuary in Northeast Fresno. The park lies on the South bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road. The initial 235 acres (0.95?km2), combined with additional acres acquired later by the city, brings the park to a sizable 300 acres (1.2?km2).[39] Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley. The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing. The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3?km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8?km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover 22 miles (35?km) between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life. The park's amphetheatre was renovated in 2010, and has hosted performances by acts such as Deftones, Tech N9ne, and Sevendust as well as numerous others. The park is open April through October, 6am to 10pm and November through March, 6am to 7pm.  Woodward Park is home to the annual CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) State Championship cross country meet, which takes place in late November. It is also the home of the Woodward Shakespeare Festival which began performances in the park in 2005.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormed in 1946, Sierra Sky Park Airport is a residential airport community born of a unique agreement in transportation law to allow personal aircraft and automobiles to share certain roads. Sierra Sky Park was the first aviation community to be built[citation needed] and there are now numerous such communities across the United States and around the world. Developer William Smilie created the nation's first planned aviation community. Still in operation today, the public use airport provides a unique neighborhood that spawned interest and similar communities nationwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresno is marked by a semi-arid climate (K?ppen BSk/BSh), with mild, moist winters and very hot, dry summers, thus displaying Mediterranean characteristics.[41] December and January are the coldest months, and average around 46.5?F (8.1?C), and there are 14 nights with freezing lows annually, with the coldest night of the year typically bottoming out around 30?F (?1.1?C).[42] July is the warmest month, averaging 83.0?F (28.3?C); normally, there are 32 days of 100?F (37.8?C)+ highs and 106 days of 90?F (32.2?C)+ highs, and in July and August, there are only three or four days where the high does not reach 90?F (32.2?C). Summers provide considerable sunshine, with July exceeding 96 percent of the total possible sunlight hours; conversely, January is the lowest with only 46 percent of the daylight time in sunlight because of tule fog. However, the year averages 81% of possible sunshine, for a total of 3550 hours.[43] Average annual precipitation is around 11.5 inches (292.1?mm), which, by definition, would classify the area as a semidesert. Most of the wind rose direction occurrences derive from the northwest, as winds are driven downward along the axis of the California Central Valley; in December, January and February there is an increased presence of southeastern wind directions in the wind rose statistics.[44] Fresno meteorology was selected in a national U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study for analysis of equilibrium temperature for use of ten-year meteorological data to represent a warm, dry western United States locale.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official record high temperature for Fresno is 115?F (46.1?C), set on July 8, 1905, while the official record low is 17?F (?8?C), set on January 6, 1913.[50] The average windows for temperatures to exceed 100?F (37.8?C) are June 1 through September 13; for temperatures in excess of 90?F (32.2?C), April 26 through October 9; and for freezing temperatures, December 10 through January 28, although  no freeze occurred during the 1983/1984 winter season.[50] Annual rainfall has ranged from 23.57 inches (598.7?mm) in the \\"rain year\\" from July 1982 to June 1983 down to 4.43 inches (112.5?mm) from July 1933 to June 1934. The most rainfall in one month was 9.54 inches (242.3?mm) in November 1885 and the most rainfall in 24 hours 3.55 inches (90.2?mm) on November 18, 1885. Measurable precipitation falls on an average of 48 days annually. Snow is a rarity; the heaviest snowfall at the airport was 2.2 inches (0.06?m) on January 21, 1962.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nFresno is the larger principal city of the Fresno-Madera CSA, a Combined Statistical Area that includes the Fresno (Fresno County) and Madera (Madera County) metropolitan areas,[55][56] which had a combined population of 922,516 at the 2000 census.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2010 United States Census[57] reported that Fresno had a population of 494,665.

The word \\"biochemist\\" is a portmanteau of \\"biological chemist\\".\\r\\nBiochemists also research how certain chemical reactions happen in cells and tissues and observe and record the effects of products in food additives and medicines. The main function of a biochemist is to focus on improving the qualities of lives.[1]\\r\\nBiochemist researchers focus on planning and conducting research experiments, mainly for developing new products, updating existing products and analyzing said products. It is also the responsibility of a biochemist to present their research findings and create grant proposals to obtain funds for future research.[2]\\r\\nBiochemists study aspects of the immune system, the expressions of genes, isolating, analyzing, and synthesizing different products, mutations that lead to cancers, and manage laboratory teams and monitor laboratory work. Biochemists also have to have the capabilities of designing and building laboratory equipment and devise new methods of producing correct results for products.[3]\\r\\nThe most common industry role is the development of biochemical products and processes. Identifying substances' chemical and physical properties in biological systems is of great importance, and can be carried out by doing various types of analysis. Biochemists must also prepare technical reports after collecting, analyzing and summarizing the information and trends found.\\r\\nIn biochemistry, researchers often break down complicated biological systems into their component parts. They study the effects of foods, drugs, allergens and other substances on living tissues; they research molecular biology, the study of life at the molecular level and the study of genes and gene expression; and they study chemical reactions in metabolism, growth, reproduction, and heredity, and apply techniques drawn from biotechnology and genetic engineering to help them in their research. About 75% work in either basic or applied research; those in applied research take basic research and employ it for the benefit of medicine, agriculture, veterinary science, environmental science, and manufacturing. Each of these fields allows specialization; for example, clinical biochemists can work in hospital laboratories to understand and treat diseases, and industrial biochemists can be involved in analytical research work, such as checking the purity of food and beverages.\\r\\nBiochemists in the field of agriculture research the interactions between herbicides with plants. They examine the relationships of compounds, determining their ability to inhibit growth, and evaluate the toxicological effects surrounding life.\\r\\nBiochemists also prepare pharmaceutical compounds for commercial distribution.\\r\\nModern Biochemistry is considered a sub-discipline of the Biological Sciences, due to its increased reliance on, and training, in accord with modern Molecular Biology. Historically, even before the term Biochemist was formally recognized, initial studies were performed by those trained in basic Chemistry, but also by those trained as Physicians.\\r\\nSome of the job skills and abilities that one needs to attain to be successful in this field of work include science, mathematics, reading comprehension, writing, and critical thinking. These skills are critical because of the nature of the experimental techniques that are used as well as the need to convey orally and written the trends found in research.\\r\\nBiochemists also need to understand inductive reasoning to take different concept and information to make develop theories, conclusions and finding a correlation between events that have no relation. With this biochemist must understand deductive reasoning as well. This means taking general information and piecing it together to arrive to a logical conclusion.\\r\\nA degree in biochemistry or a related science such as chemistry is the minimum requirement for any work in this field. This is sufficient for a position as a technical assistant in industry or in academic settings. A Ph.D. (or equivalent) is generally required to pursue or direct independent research. To advance further in commercial environments, one may need to acquire skills in management.\\r\\nBiochemists must pass a qualifying exam or a preliminary exam to continue their studies when receiving a Ph.D. in biochemistry. (Biochemistry Training Programs and Requirements)\\r\\nBiochemistry requires an understanding of organic and inorganic chemistry. All types of chemistry are required, with emphasis on biochemistry, organic chemistry and physical chemistry. Basic classes in biology, including microbiology, molecular biology, molecular genetics, cell biology, and genomics, are focused on. Some instruction in experimental techniques and quantification is also part of most curricula.\\r\\nIn the private industries for businesses, it is imperative to possess strong business management skills as well as communication skills. Biochemists must also be familiar with regulatory rules and management techniques.[4]\\r\\nDue to the reliance on most principles of the basic science of Biochemistry, early contemporary Physicians were informally qualified to perform research on their own in mainly this (today also related Biomedical sciences) field.\\r\\nBiochemists are typically employed in the life sciences, where they work in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry in a research role. They are also employed in academic institutes, where in addition to pursuing their research they may also be involved with teaching undergraduates, training graduate students, and collaborating with post-doctoral fellows.\\r\\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that jobs in the biochemist, combined with the statistics of biophysicists, field would increase by 31% between 2004 and 2014 because of the demand in medical research and development of new drugs and products, and the preservation of the environment.\\r\\nBecause of a biochemists' background in both biology and chemistry, they may also be employed in the medical, industrial, governmental, and environmental fields. Slightly more than half of the biological scientists are employed by the Federal State and local governments. The field of medicine includes nutrition, genetics, biophysics, and pharmacology; industry includes beverage and food technology, toxicology, and vaccine production; while the governmental and environmental fields includes forensic science, wildlife management, marine biology, and viticulture.\\r\\nThe average income of a biochemist was $68,950 in May 2004. The National Association of Colleges and Employers reports that the beginning salary offers in July 2005 averaged $31,258 a year for bachelor's degree recipients in biological and life sciences.

The company was founded in 1893 in Steckborn, Switzerland, by a Swiss inventor Fritz Gegauf. The company develops, manufactures, and sells goods and services for the textile market, primarily household sewing-related products in the fields of embroidery, quilting, home textiles, garment sewing, and crafting.[2] The origins of the company lie in the invention of the hemstitch sewing machine, invented in 1893 by a Swiss inventor and entrepreneur Karl Friedrich Gegauf. Currently, the company's products include sewing machines, embroidery machines, serger/overlocker machines, and computer software for embroidery design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present-day Bernina International AG was founded by Karl Friedrich Gegauf in 1893, when he decided to pursue an apprenticeship as a mechanic instead of studying medicine. After completing his apprenticeship, he worked in the Baum embroidery machine factory in Rorschach. In 1890, Karl Friedrich Gegauf set up his own business in Steckborn, Switzerland, opening an embroidery and mechanical workshop for the manufacture of his own invention, a monogram embroidery machine. Together with his brother Georg, a salesman, Karl Friedrich ran the Gebrder Gegauf (Bros. Gegauf) company. Through his involvement in the textile industry, he noticed how laborious it was to produce hemstitching, which until then could only be done manually. Consequently, in 1893, Karl Friedrich Gegauf invented the worlds first hemstitch sewing machine, capable of sewing 100 stitches per minute.[3] In 1895, the Bros. Gegauf workshop was completely destroyed by fire, except for the prototype of the hemstitch sewing machine, which was the only thing that could be rescued. Karl Friedrich built a new workshop in an old barn, where the focus was no longer on embroidery, but on the construction of the hemstitch sewing machine. About 70 people were employed in the serial production of the hemstitch sewing machine. The mechanical production of hemstitching, whether as embellishment for handkerchiefs, tablecloths, or bedspreads, was commonly referred to as \\"gegaufing\\", because the name Gegauf became famous in the industry.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1919, Fritz Gegauf, one of Karls sons, together with his father, filed a patent application for the \\"Wotan\\" hemstich sewing machine, which became another international success for the company, which changed its name to \\"Fritz Gegauf\\". After being in Paris selling the companys tin openers, which had no market in Switzerland, he returned to his home town. His brother Gustav and he took control of the factory after their fathers death in 1926.[5] During the Great Depression, Fritz Gegauf joined forces with the embroidery factory, Brtsch & Sohn in St. Gallen, which was also operating in the red. By the end of 1932, they had developed the company's first household sewing machine, which they named Bernina. The Bernina was soon being produced as furniture-cum-sewing-machine, which required the building of a new, attached furniture factory in Steckborn. As of October 26, 1937, a total of 20,000 machines had left the factory in Steckborn. In 1937, he introduced the first Bernina zigzag machine and in 1945 the worlds first portable zigzag machine on the market. In 1947, Gustav Gegauf left the company. By mid-1963, one million Bernina zigzag sewing machines had been manufactured in Steckborn. Since then, the company has commonly been called Bernina, although, since 1947, its official name has been \\"Fritz Gegauf Aktiengesellschaft, Bernina N?hmaschinenfabrik\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1959, Odette Ueltschi, Fritz Gegauf's daughter, took the lead role at Bernina.[6] She took over the management after the death of her brother in 1965. In 1963, the first Bernina sewing machine with a patented knee-activated presser foot lifter, the 730, appeared on the market. From 1963 onwards, the subsequent model, the 730, was produced, and in the same year, the millionth Bernina sewing machine was manufactured. The top-seller of all the models was the 830 class, which came into production in 1971 and continued until 1981. In 1981, the company took a further step in the development of household sewing machines. The 930 model was the first machine with a stretch-stitch function. It was followed by the 1130, the first fully automated sewing machine, the 1130, launched in 1986. The enduring mark which Odette Gegauf-Ueltschi left on the company is reflected in the name of the bernette sewing machine line, formed by a combination of the first half of the brand name and the second half of her given name.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nHanspeter Ueltschi took over the management of Fritz Gegauf AG in 1988 from his mother Odette Gegauf-Ueltschi, and  currently runs the company as owner and chairman of the board of directors. After studying business administration at the University of St. Gallen, Ueltschi spent seven years gaining professional experience in the USA before getting into the leadership of the family company in Switzerland. Ueltschi further expanded the leading position of the company in the sewing machine technology sector, brought down manufacturing costs, and promoted product innovations and marketing. He ushered the computer age into the business with the artista 180, Berninas first sewing computer, and ensured the continuous development and optimization of computer technology in the sewing sphere, as shown by the successive models of the artista, as well as the aurora series. In doing so, he made strides toward his declared goal of making sewing more appealing and more popular worldwide. Under the chairmanship of Hanspeter Ueltschi, a manufacturing outlet was set up in Thailand, in addition to the parent factory in Steckborn. He is also largely responsible for establishing the US as a key market and expansion to the new markets in Eastern Europe, Russia, South America, and India, as well as in the Middle East. He renamed \\"Fritz Gegauf AG\\" to \\"Bernina International AG\\"  to accommodate the trend toward globalization and the success of the company brand and at the same time, Ueltschi incorporated the flag of Switzerland into the company logo as a sign of patriotism. Linking to the 830, the most successful Bernina model from the 1970s, the new B830, in 2008 and its sister model, the B820, in 2009, were introduced as the most advanced sewing machines of the brand to date, with a total of 15 patents filed for the new B830.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bernina Textile Group is a globally active group of 15 companies doing business in 80 countries. The company operates in the product categories such as household sewing and embroidery machines, household overlocker machines, longarm quilting machines, multineedle embroidery machines, accessories (presser foot, embroidery hoops and other accessories for sewing, quilting and overlocking), and computer software for embroidery design.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsidiaries are established in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the USA.

The second invasion achieved more: the Romans installed a king, Mandubracius, who was friendly to Rome, and they forced the submission of Mandubracius's rival, Cassivellaunus. No territory was conquered and held for Rome; instead, all Roman-occupied territory was restored to the allied Trinovantes, along with the promised tribute of the other tribes in what is now eastern England.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBritain had long been known to the classical world as a source of tin. The coastline had been explored by the Greek geographer Pytheas in the 4th century BC, and may have been explored even earlier, in the 5th, by the Carthaginian sailor Himilco. But to many Romans, the island, lying as it did beyond the Ocean at what was to them the edge of the \\"known world,\\" was a land of great mystery. Some Roman writers even insisted that it did not exist,[2] and dismissed reports of Pytheas's voyage as a hoax.[3]\\r\\nBritain during the reign of Julius Caesar had an Iron Age culture, with an estimated population of between one and four million. Archaeological research shows that its economy was broadly divided into lowland and highland zones. In the lowland southeast, large areas of fertile soil made possible extensive arable farming, and communication developed along trackways, such as the Icknield Way, the Pilgrims' Way and the Jurassic Way, and navigable rivers such as the Thames. In the highlands, north of the line between Gloucester and Lincoln, arable land was available in only isolated pockets, so pastoralism, supported by garden cultivation, was more common than settled farming, and communication was more difficult. Settlements were generally built on high ground and fortified, but in the southeast, oppida had begun to be established on lower ground, often at river crossings, suggesting that trade was becoming more important. Commercial contact between Britain and the continent had increased since the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul in 124 BC, and Italian wine was being imported via the Armorican peninsula, much of it arriving at Hengistbury Head in Dorset.[4]\\r\\nCaesar's written account of Britain says that the Belgae of northeastern Gaul had previously conducted raids on Britain, establishing settlements in some of its coastal areas, and that within living memory Diviciacus, king of the Suessiones, had held power in Britain as well as Gaul.[5] British coinage from this period shows a complicated pattern of intrusion. The earliest Gallo-Belgic coins that have been found in Britain date to before 100 BC, perhaps as early as 150 BC, were struck in Gaul, and have been found mainly in Kent. Later coins of a similar type were struck in Britain and are found all along the south coast as far west as Dorset. It appears that Belgic power was concentrated on the southeastern coast, although their influence spread further west and inland, perhaps through chieftains establishing political control over the native population.[6]\\r\\nCaesar claimed that, in the course of his conquest of Gaul, the Britons had supported the campaigns of the mainland Gauls against him, with fugitives from among the Gallic Belgae fleeing to Belgic settlements in Britain,[7] and the Veneti of Armorica, who controlled seaborne trade to the island, calling in aid from their British allies to fight for them against Caesar in 56 BC.[8] Strabo says that the Venetic rebellion in 56 BC had been intended to prevent Caesar from travelling to Britain and disrupting their commercial activity,[9] suggesting that the possibility of a British expedition had already been considered by then.\\r\\nIn late summer, 55 BC, even though it was late in the campaigning season, Caesar decided to make an expedition to Britain. He summoned merchants who traded with the island, but they were unable or unwilling to give him any useful information about the inhabitants and their military tactics, or about harbours he could use, presumably not wanting to lose their monopoly on cross-channel trade. He sent a tribune, Gaius Volusenus, to scout the coast in a single warship. He probably examined the Kent coast between Hythe and Sandwich, but was unable to land, since he \\"did not dare leave his ship and entrust himself to the barbarians\\",[10] and after five days returned to give Caesar what intelligence he had managed to gather.\\r\\nBy then, ambassadors from some of the British states, warned by merchants of the impending invasion, had arrived promising their submission. Caesar sent them back, along with his ally Commius, king of the Gallic Atrebates, to use their influence to win over as many other states as possible.\\r\\nHe gathered a fleet consisting of eighty transport ships, sufficient to carry two legions (Legio VII and Legio X), and an unknown number of warships under a quaestor, at an unnamed port in the territory of the Morini, almost certainly Portius Itius (Boulogne). Another eighteen transports of cavalry were to sail from a different port, probably Ambleteuse.[11] These ships may have been triremes or biremes, or may have been adapted from Venetic designs Caesar had seen previously, or may even have been requisitioned from the Veneti and other coastal tribes. Clearly in a hurry, Caesar himself left a garrison at the port and set out \\"at the third watch\\" ÿ well after midnight ÿ on 23 August[12] with the legions, leaving the cavalry to march to their ships, embark, and join him as soon as possible. In light of later events, this was either a tactical mistake or (along with the fact that the legions came over without baggage or heavy siege gear)[13] confirms the invasion was not intended for complete conquest.\\r\\nCaesar initially tried to land at Dubris (Dover), whose natural harbour had presumably been identified by Volusenus as a suitable landing place. However, when he came in sight of shore, the massed forces of the Britons gathered on the overlooking hills and cliffs dissuaded him from landing there, since the cliffs were so close to the shore that javelins could be thrown down from them onto anyone landing there.[14] After waiting there at anchor \\"until the ninth hour\\" (about 3pm) waiting for his supply ships from the second port to come up and meanwhile convening a council of war, he ordered his subordinates to act on their own initiative and then sailed the fleet about 7 miles (11 kilometres) along the coast to an open beach. In the absence of archaeological evidence at the landing point, this beach was most probably at Walmer, which is the right distance up the coast from the White Cliffs.[15] It was thought in the 19th century to be near Deal Castle, a house there named SPQR, but is now thought to be 1?2?mi (800?m) further south, where it is now marked by a concrete memorial.\\r\\nHaving been tracked all the way along the coast by the British cavalry and chariots, the landing was opposed. To make matters worse, the loaded Roman ships were too low in the water to go close inshore and the troops had to disembark in deep water, all the while attacked by the enemy from the shallows. The troops were reluctant, but according to Caesar's account were led by the aquilifer (standard bearer) of the 10th legion who jumped in first as an example, shouting:\\r\\nThe British were eventually driven back with catapultae and slings fired from the warships into the exposed flank of their formation and the Romans managed to land and drive them off. The cavalry, delayed by adverse winds, still had not arrived, so the Britons could not be pursued and finished off, and Caesar could not enjoy what he calls, in his usual self-promoting style, his \\"accustomed success\\".[17]\\r\\nThe Romans established a camp of which no archaeological trace has been found, received ambassadors and had Commius, who had been arrested as soon as he had arrived in Britain, returned to them. Caesar claims he was negotiating from a position of strength and that the British leaders, blaming their attacks on him on the common people, were in only four days awed into giving hostages, some immediately, some as soon as they could be brought from inland, and disbanding their army. However, after his cavalry had come within sight of the beachhead but then been scattered and turned back to Gaul by storms, and with food running short, Caesar, a native of the Mediterranean, was taken by surprise by high British tides and a storm. His beached warships filled with water, and his transports, riding at anchor, were driven against each other. Some ships were wrecked, and many others were rendered unseaworthy by the loss of rigging or other vital equipment, threatening the return journey.\\r\\nRealising this and hoping to keep Caesar in Britain over the winter and thus starve him into submission, the Britons renewed the attack, ambushing one of the legions as it foraged near the Roman camp. The foraging party was relieved by the remainder of the Roman force and the Britons were again driven off, only to regroup after several days of storms with a larger force to attack the Roman camp. This attack was driven off fully, in a bloody rout, with improvised cavalry that Commius had gathered from pro-Roman Britons and a Roman scorched earth policy.\\r\\nThe British once again sent ambassadors and Caesar, although he doubled the number of hostages, realised he could not hold out any longer and dare not risk a stormy winter crossing, Caesar had set out late in the campaigning season and the winter was approaching, and so allowed them to be delivered to him in Gaul, to which he returned with as many of the ships as could be repaired with flotsam from the wrecked ships. Even then, only two tribes felt sufficiently threatened by Caesar to actually send the hostages, and two of his transports were separated from the main body and made landfall elsewhere.\\r\\nIn short, the campaign had not been a success. If it had been intended as a full-scale campaign, invasion or occupation, it had failed, and even if it is seen as a reconnaissance-in-force or a show of strength to deter further British aid to the Gauls, it had fallen short. Nonetheless, going to Britain at all carried such kudos for a Roman that the Senate decreed a supplicatio (thanksgiving) of twenty days when they received Caesar's report.\\r\\nCaesar's pretext for the invasion was that \\"in almost all the wars with the Gauls succors had been furnished to our enemy from that country\\". This is plausible, although it may also have been a cover for investigating Britain's mineral resources and economic potential: afterwards, Cicero refers to the disappointing discovery that there was no gold or silver in the island;[18] and Suetonius reports that Caesar was said to have gone to Britain in search of pearls.[19]\\r\\nA second invasion was planned in the winter of 55ÿ54 for the summer of 54 BC. Cicero wrote letters to his friend Gaius Trebatius Testa and his brother Quintus, both of whom were serving in Caesar's army, expressing his excitement at the prospect. He urged Trebatius to capture him a war chariot, and asked Quintus to write him a description of the island. Trebatius, as it turned out, did not go to Britain, but Quintus did, and wrote him several letters from there ÿ as did Caesar himself.[20]\\r\\nDetermined not to make the same mistakes as the previous year, Caesar gathered a larger force than on his previous expedition with five legions as opposed to two, plus two-thousand cavalry, carried in ships which he designed, with experience of Venetic shipbuilding technology, to be more suitable to a beach landing than those used in 55 BC being broader and lower for easier beaching. This time he names Portus Itius as the departure point.[21]\\r\\nLabienus was left at Portus Itius to oversee regular food transports from there to the British beachhead. The military ships were joined by a flotilla of trading ships captained by Romans and provincials from across the empire, and local Gauls, hoping to cash in on the trading opportunities. It seems more likely that the figure Caesar quotes for the fleet (800 ships) include these traders and the troop-transports, rather than the troop-transports alone.\\r\\nCaesar landed at the place he had identified as the best landing-place the previous year. The Britons did not oppose the landing, apparently, as Caesar states, intimidated by the size of the fleet, but equally this may have been a strategic ploy to give them time to gather their forces, or may reflect their lack of concern.\\r\\nUpon landing, Caesar left Quintus Atrius in charge of the beach-head and made an immediate night march 12?mi (19?km) inland, where he encountered the British forces at a river crossing, probably somewhere on the River Stour. The Britons attacked but were repulsed, and attempted to regroup at a fortified place in the forests, possibly the hillfort at Bigbury Wood, Kent,[22] but were again defeated and scattered. As it was late in the day and Caesar was unsure of the territory, he called off the pursuit and made camp.\\r\\nHowever, the next morning, as he prepared to advance further, Caesar received word from Atrius that, once again, his ships at anchor had been dashed against each other in a storm and suffered considerable damage. About forty, he says, were lost. The Romans were unused to Atlantic and Channel tides and storms, but nevertheless, considering the damage he had sustained the previous year, this was poor planning on Caesar's part. However, Caesar may have exaggerated the number of ships wrecked to magnify his own achievement in rescuing the situation.[23] He returned to the coast, recalling the legions that had gone ahead, and immediately set about repairing his fleet. His men worked day and night for approximately ten days, beaching and repairing the ships, and building a fortified camp around them. Word was sent to Labienus to send more ships.\\r\\nCaesar was on the coast on 1 September, from where he wrote a letter to Cicero. News must have reached him at this point of the death of his daughter Julia, as Cicero refrained from replying \\"on account of his mourning\\".[24]\\r\\nCaesar then returned to the Stour crossing and found the Britons had massed their forces there. Cassivellaunus, a warlord from north of the Thames, had previously been at war with most of the British tribes. He had recently overthrown the king of the powerful Trinovantes and forced his son, Mandubracius, into exile, but now the Britons had appointed him to lead their combined forces. After several indecisive skirmishes, during which a Roman tribune, Quintus Laberius Durus, was killed, the Britons attacked a foraging party of three legions under Gaius Trebonius, but were repulsed and routed by the pursuing Roman cavalry.\\r\\nCassivellaunus realised he could not defeat Caesar in a pitched battle. Disbanding the majority of his force and relying on the mobility of his 4,000 chariots and superior knowledge of the terrain, he used guerrilla tactics to slow the Roman advance. By the time Caesar reached the Thames, the one fordable place available to him had been fortified with sharpened stakes, both on the shore and under the water, and the far bank was defended. Second Century sources state that Caesar used a large war elephant, which was equipped with armour and carried archers and slingers in its tower, to put the defenders to flight. When this unknown creature entered the river, the Britons and their horses fled and the Roman army crossed over and entered Cassivellaunus' territory.[25]\\r\\nThe Trinovantes, whom Caesar describes as the most powerful tribe in the region, and who had recently suffered at Cassivellaunus' hands, sent ambassadors, promising him aid and provisions. Mandubracius, who had accompanied Caesar, was restored as their king, and the Trinovantes provided grain and hostages. Five further tribes, the Cenimagni, Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci and Cassi, surrendered to Caesar, and revealed to him the location of Cassivellaunus' stronghold, possibly the hill fort at Wheathampstead,[26] which he proceeded to put under siege.\\r\\nCassivellaunus sent word to his allies in Kent, Cingetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus and Segovax, described as the \\"four kings of Cantium\\",[27] to stage a diversionary attack on the Roman beach-head to draw Caesar off, but this attack failed, and Cassivellaunus sent ambassadors to negotiate a surrender. Caesar was eager to return to Gaul for the winter due to growing unrest there, and an agreement was mediated by Commius. Cassivellaunus gave hostages, agreed an annual tribute, and undertook not to make war against Mandubracius or the Trinovantes. Caesar wrote to Cicero on 26 September, confirming the result of the campaign, with hostages but no booty taken, and that his army was about to return to Gaul.[28] He then left, leaving not a single Roman soldier in Britain to enforce his settlement. Whether the tribute was ever paid is unknown.\\r\\nCommius, Caesar's Atrebatian ally, later switched sides, fighting in Vercingetorix's rebellion. After a number of unsuccessful engagements with Caesar's forces, he cut his losses and fled to Britain. Sextus Julius Frontinus, in his Strategemata, describes how Commius and his followers, with Caesar in pursuit, boarded their ships. Although the tide was out and the ships still beached, Commius ordered the sails raised. Caesar, still some distance away, assumed the ships were afloat and called off the pursuit.[29] Archaeologist John Creighton[30] believes that this anecdote was a legend, and that Commius was sent to Britain as a friendly king as part of his truce with Mark Antony.[31] Commius established a dynasty in the Hampshire area, known from coins of Gallo-Belgic type. Verica, the king whose exile prompted Claudius's conquest of AD 43, styled himself a son of Commius.\\r\\nAs well as noting elements of British warfare, particularly the use of chariots, which were unfamiliar to his Roman audience, Caesar also aimed to impress them by making further geographical, meteorological and ethnographic investigations of Britain. He probably gained these by enquiry and hearsay rather than direct experience, as he did not penetrate that far into the interior, and most historians would be wary of applying them beyond the tribes with whom he came into direct contact.\\r\\nCaesar's first-hand discoveries were limited to east Kent and the Thames Valley, but he was able to provide a description of the island's geography and meteorology. Though his measurements are not wholly accurate, and may owe something to Pytheas, his general conclusions even now seem valid:\\r\\nNo information about harbours or other landing-places was available to the Romans before Caesar's expeditions, so Caesar was able to make discoveries of benefit to Roman military and trading interests. Volusenus's reconnaissance voyage before the first expedition apparently identified the natural harbour at Dubris (Dover), although Caesar was prevented from landing there and forced to land on an open beach, as he did again the following year, perhaps because Dover was too small for his much larger forces. The great natural harbours further up the coast at Rutupiae (Richborough), which were used by Claudius for his invasion 100 years later, were not used on either occasion. Caesar may have been unaware of them, may have chosen not to use them, or they may not have existed in a form suitable for sheltering and landing such a large force at that time. Present knowledge of the period geomorphology of the Wantsum Channel that created that haven is limited.\\r\\nBy Claudius' time Roman knowledge of the island would have been considerably increased by a century of trade and diplomacy, and four abortive invasion attempts. However, it is likely that the intelligence gathered in 55 and 54 BC would have been retained in the now-lost state records in Rome, and been used by Claudius in the planning of his landings.\\r\\nThe Britons are defined as typical barbarians, with polygamy and other exotic social habits, similar in many ways to the Gauls,[34] yet as brave adversaries whose crushing can bring glory to a Roman:\\r\\nIn addition to infantry and cavalry, the Britons employed chariots, a novelty to the Romans, in warfare. Caesar describes their use as follows:\\r\\nDuring the civil war, Caesar made use of a kind of boat he had seen used in Britain, similar to the Irish currach or Welsh coracle. He describes them thus:\\r\\nCaesar not only investigates this for the sake of it, but also to justify Britain as a rich source of tribute and trade:\\r\\nThis reference to the 'midland' is inaccurate as tin production and trade occurred in the southwest of England, in Cornwall and Devon, and was what drew Pytheas and other traders. However, Caesar only penetrated to Essex and so, receiving reports of the trade whilst there, it would have been easy to perceive the trade as coming from the interior.\\r\\nCaesar made no conquests in Britain, but his enthroning of Mandubracius marked the beginnings of a system of client kingdoms there, thus bringing the island into Rome's sphere of political influence. Diplomatic and trading links developed further over the next century, opening up the possibility of permanent conquest, which was finally begun by Claudius in AD 43. In the words of Tacitus:","input":"Where did the romans first land in england?"},{"output":"Season 8","context":"Dr. Mark Greene is a fictional medical doctor from the television series ER, portrayed by the actor Anthony Edwards. For most of his time on the series, Greene's role was that of a mediator and occasional authority figure, and he was considered the main character of the series for the first eight seasons.  Mark was also the only original character to die, and his death at the end of Season 8 marked one of the biggest turning points in the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nMark Greene, an only child, was raised by his mother, Ruth, and father, David. David Greene served in the United States Navy, and thus the family moved frequently and lived all over the country, including: Jacksonville, Florida, Norfolk, Virginia, Corpus Christi, Texas, Washington D.C.,[1] Kings Bay, Georgia,[2] and Hawaii, where they spent three years, David's longest assignment.[3] Mark had a very strained relationship with his father, and was decidedly closer to his mother. He would often act out in an attempt to upset his father, and aimed his goals in the opposite of what his father wanted. Mark thought his father's Navy career mattered more to him than his family, only to later learn that David was on track to be an Admiral and turned down the chance in order to come home and help Mark with a bully. The most memorable time of his childhood was when his family was in Hawaii, a time he would later recreate with daughter Rachel during the last few weeks of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile still in high school, Mark met and soon after developed a romantic relationship with Jennifer (Jen). Presumably their relationship lasted the duration of their time in college, and at some point around the time Greene was at medical school, he married Jennifer. His daughter, Rachel was born shortly afterwards. While in medical school, he met future colleague Peter Benton. He then completed his internship and residency in the Emergency Department of County General Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, from there he was awarded the position of Chief Resident of the Emergency Department. While there, Mark developed close friendships with Dr. Doug Ross, a pediatrician, Dr. Susan Lewis, an ER resident, and nurse manager, Carol Hathaway. Although Mark enjoys working the ER, the many nights on call, and the long hours, in addition to Jen's decision to complete law school, have strained their marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the pilot episode, which takes place on St. Patrick's Day 1994, Dr. Greene is awakened in the first scene to help his long-time friend Doug, the ER resident who often comes in to sober up on his nights off. Also, his close friendship with Susan is shown as they confide in each other about their personal lives while on break. During the same episode, Jen gets Mark to visit a private practice near the hospital to explore the possibility of leaving his job at the ER and get more family-friendly hours. Mark decides the \\"clean\\" medicine isn't his cup of tea. Back at the ER, Mark removes a hangnail from an older woman, who wanted him to remove it despite the fact she'd be charged $180. Later during the night, Mark has to urge everyone to get back to work when Carol is rushed into the ER after a shocking suicide attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first season, Dr. Greene's marriage becomes increasingly shaky. When offered an attending physician's position by David Morgenstern, Mark readily accepts, much to Jen's chagrin. As a newly admitted member of the bar, Jen has been clerking for a judge in Milwaukee, and becomes increasingly tired of commuting and living separately to accommodate Mark's job. She begins an affair with a coworker, and the marriage soon ends, with Rachel and Jen leaving Chicago first for Milwaukee and later for St. Louis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn \\"Love's Labor Lost\\", Mark makes miscalculations in treating a pregnant woman that lead to her death in childbirth, and the after-effects of this case linger long into Season 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn \\"A Miracle Happens Here\\", a Christmas episode, Mark explains that he is the son of an agnostic Jew and a lapsed Catholic. He lights a Hanukkah candle for a Holocaust survivor.[4] Mark understands some Yiddish.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMark's career becomes more difficult as he needs to make decisions that periodically alienate his friends, such as selecting Dr. Kerry Weaver for Chief Resident over another applicant, which angers Susan Lewis because the other applicant is a good friend of hers  and because she bristles under Kerry's demanding, sometimes harsh leadership style. Mark's friendship with Dr. Ross becomes strained as his administrative tasks often put him at odds with Doug's wild ways and he is disgusted by Doug's personal problems to the point where he briefly overrules and belittles Doug's abilities as a physician before reconciling with his friend. His love life takes a more drastic downward spin when his feelings for Dr. Lewis increase, but she leaves the hospital for a job in Phoenix, Arizona. He suffers emotionally again after he is attacked in the ER men's room in the episode \\"Random Acts\\". The attack is initially believed to be retaliatory act to avenge the death of a patient who may have been \\"mistreated\\" by Dr. Greene because of the patient's race. Later, though, it is strongly implied that his assailant was a psychotic individual who was randomly attacking doctors. Mark buys a gun and uses it to scare  a crowd of punks on a train but tosses the gun in the river soon afterwards. He struggles through a large part of Season 4 but comes to terms with his attack in Season 5 when he helps Nigerian-born janitor Mobilage Ekabo reveal his memories of torture by talking about the attack with him, allowing him to obtain political asylum and avoid deportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the passing of Doug's father comes the re-entrance of Mark's parents. He and Doug travel to California to settle Doug's father's affairs (Doug's father and new wife were both killed in a car wreck) and take a side trip to visit Mark's parents, who live in another part of California. His relationship with his father David is still strained, and his mother suffers from a string of medical conditions associated with aging. Mark also finds out that his mother viewed his birth as a mistake, as she didn't know his father well and got married quickly when she got pregnant. Mark's distrust of the Navy puts him at odds with David when he and Mark fight over whether Ruth should be treated in a base hospital or a civilian hospital. Ruth eventually dies and Mark goes to her funeral, leaving him on edge when he clashes with Kerry Weaver over Robert Romano's successful drive for the chief of staff position.\\r\\n\\r\\nMark's personal life after his marriage is tumultuous. He takes after Doug, having several flings and an affair with Nurse Chuny Marquez, and setting up three dates in one day. He has a brief relationship with a needy desk clerk, Cynthia Hooper (played by Mariska Hargitay in season 4). Hooper leaves him after she finds out Mark doesn't really love her. Mark eventually meets a British surgeon, Elizabeth Corday. Corday is in Chicago on an exchange program, under the guidance of Dr. Romano. Romano's advances on Corday fail, as does her relationship with Peter Benton. Eventually, Mark and Elizabeth begin dating in Season 5, finally forming a stable and happy relationship. During Season 6, Mark discovers that his father is suffering from advanced lung cancer. After David loses his wife and develops end stage lung cancer, he realises that he can no longer live alone, and he moves to Chicago and stays with Mark; after an awkward first meeting, he warms up to Elizabeth very quickly. After an emotional bonding that heals their difficult relationship from Mark's youth, David dies.\\r\\n\\r\\nMark and Elizabeth begin a more serious relationship and move in together. Mark later buys a house, and he and Elizabeth get married and have a daughter, Ella. Their happiness is threatened, though, when the abusive father of a patient goes on a killing rampage after losing his son to social workers. In a bid to get his son back, he kills and injures a number of people and attempts to go after Elizabeth and Ella. After being shot by an armed bystander, he is brought to the ER. During his treatment, Mark takes him aboard an elevator to go to an operating room. The patient goes into arrest when alone in the elevator with Mark, who withholds defibrillation and allows him to go into vfib and die.  He later falsifies records to show that he did attempt to save the patient. Elizabeth suspects what Mark did but lets the matter drop. Later, Rachel appears in Chicago unannounced, citing arguments with her mother, and moves in with Mark and a very reluctant Elizabeth. She sneaks out of the house at night and uses drugs, which clouds her relationship with Elizabeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile suturing a patient's wound, Mark loses control of his faculties and is temporarily unable to speak. After a CT scan and a biopsy, he is diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, that is thought to be inoperable. Embarrassed, Greene briefly tries to hide his condition, but his cover is blown when he has a seizure while arguing with Carter. With little time, Mark seeks a second opinion from an eminent New York City neurosurgeon, Dr. Burke. Mark is told that the tumor is near a critical section of his brain but hasn't \\"invaded\\" it yet and they can perform an operation on New Year's Eve 2000. Mark's surgery is performed by Burke and things appear to be positive, although it takes him a while to return to his old self. A year or so later, however, Mark finds out his tumor has returned, and Dr. Burke both confirms this and says he cannot operate again because the tumor regrowth is now in part of his brain where an operation would render Mark completely vegetative.  While chemo treatment will only allow Mark to live for another 5ÿ6 months, Burke points out: \\"You should have been dead a year ago, Mark.  You got married, saw your daughter be born - I'd say that was time well spent.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, Rachel has run away from Jenn in St. Louis and is staying with Mark and Elizabeth.  Though she vehemently denies it, her recreational drug use becomes apparent when her baby sister Ella gets hold of some ecstasy in her backpack and nearly dies after ingesting it in the episode \\"Damage is Done\\".  When Rachel shows up, Mark can barely control his anger at her, berating her for repeatedly lying to him and for putting Ella in danger.  However, he sees her remorse and fear for Ella are genuine; knowing Elizabeth is angry enough for both of them, he hugs Rachel when she starts to cry.  When Mark refuses to throw Rachel out of the house, Elizabeth says she won't return home with Ella as long as Rachel is there and leaves home with Ella and moves into a hotel. Unwilling to tell Elizabeth about his condition, Mark stays with Susan during the course of his chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Elizabeth later finds out the truth and wants to come home, but Mark tells her she shouldn't pretend to be his wife just because he's sick; however, she returns anyway and begins helping Mark as his terminal illness advances.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, however, he resigns himself to his fate and decides to halt the debilitating chemo, deciding he would rather have three good final months than twice that suffering from his treatments. On his last day in the ER, he meets with the same older woman that viewers saw on the first episode of ER. She again has a hangnail, and complains about how painful it is. Mark tells her that he has an inoperable tumor, asks another doctor to treat her, and tells the patient not to return to the ER again. He leaves the ER, stops his chemotherapy treatments, tells John Carter that he will now \\"set the tone\\" and takes Rachel on a last-minute trip to Hawaii to rebuild his relationship with her and relive happier times.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter several moves around the island and some conflict with a surly Rachel, Mark suffers from increased symptoms, prompting Rachel to call Elizabeth, who comes to Hawaii with Ella. One night, Rachel comes to her father's room while he sleeps. Mark awakens and smiles at Rachel, telling her with slurred speech that he was just dreaming of her and how she used to love balloons. He tells her that he was trying to think of a piece of advice that every father should tell his daughter, and tells her to be generous with her time, her love, and her life. Rachel tells her father that she remembers a lullaby that Mark used to sing her when she was a baby and slips a pair of headphones on his head and plays Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's rendition of \\"Over The Rainbow\\" for him as he smiles and falls back asleep. While the song plays, he is seen walking through an empty ER. The next morning, Elizabeth discovers that he has died.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the episode \\"The Letter,\\" Carter discovers two faxes that had arrived earlier, both sent by Elizabeth. He reads the first one to the staff. It is a letter that Mark had written about his sentiments about the Chicago County ER where he had worked for many years, and the staff he had worked with throughout the years. They begin happily discussing his letter until someone notices that Carter is holding the second fax, visibly upset. He informs them that the second is a brief letter written by Elizabeth, notifying them that Mark had died that morning around 6 A.M., \\" at sunrise, his favorite time of the day.\\" She explains that she sent the first letter to show the staff at the ER what he thought of them. As the staff responds sadly to this news, Frank asks if he should post the second fax on the staff bulletin board, and Carter tells him to post both of them. The letter and the news of his passing sends many of the ER's staff that day into emotional turmoil, with Kerry Weaver going from second-guessing Abby's posting of the letter (she quickly changes her mind and says it should stay up) to crying and stating her regrets to Sandy Lopez that she's lost a friend. This portion of the episode closely models the scene at the end of the film Mister Roberts, when Jack Lemmon's character, Ensign Pulver, reads two similar letters connected with the title character's death. It was also revealed in the episode by Susan Lewis that he died at the age of 38, making his birth year end 1963 or 1964. At the close of the episode, as the staff rush out to the ambulance bay to handle incoming casualties, the wind blowing through the open door tears one page of Mark's letter off the bulletin board.\\r\\n\\r\\nMark's body is returned to Chicago, where he is buried. Many of his friends and colleagues come to the funeral: John Carter, Peter Benton, Kerry Weaver, Abby Lockhart, Luka Kova?, Susan Lewis, Jing-Mei Chen, Robert Romano, Jerry Markovic, Lydia Wright, Frank Martin, Donald Anspaugh, William \\"Wild Willy\\" Swift (played by Michael Ironside in 1994), Haleh Adams, Michael Gallant, Cleo Finch, Jen, Rachel, Ella, and Elizabeth. After the funeral, Rachel asks Elizabeth if she can visit to see Ella; Elizabeth responds \\"Of course, she's your sister.\\" Rachel then suddenly asks the driver to pull over: she walks to a bunch of balloons attached to a fence, takes a purple one and slowly lets go of it, watching it rise toward the sky. Rachel goes back to living with her mother in St. Louis, but later returns to Chicago when the time comes to select a college, as well as asking a bemused Elizabeth to help her acquire effective birth control pills. In the April 2009 ER series finale, she returns to County General to interview for a spot as a med student, showing that she has become a responsible young woman and followed in Mark's footsteps.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Mark Greene was written out of the series because actor Anthony Edwards had decided that he wanted to move on to other opportunities. Greene was shown in an old Christmas photo in Season 10's \\"Freefall,\\" alongside Abby and Drs. Lewis, Carter, and Kovac. He also appears in photos included in the slideshow shown at Dr. Carter's farewell party in the Season 11 episode \\"The Show Must Go On\\". Greene was also heard in a voice-over telling Carter that he needed to \\"set the tone\\" in the ER (which, incidentally, was what Dr. Morgenstern told Dr. Greene in the pilot episode). In the Season 12 episode \\"Body and Soul,\\" he is mentioned during a flashback to 2002, when Dr. Pratt tells his patient, Nate Lennox (James Woods), that the reason the ER has few staff working is because they are at Greene's funeral. In Season 14's \\"Blackout,\\" Nurse Chuny Marquez says that she can't believe the ER is going to be led by Pratt and Morris and says how she remembers when Mark Greene and Doug Ross used to run the place. Nurse Sam Taggart then says, \\"Who?\\", since she started working in the ER long after they had left.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, ER producers announced that Edwards would reprise his role for the series' final season, with Dr. Greene appearing in flashbacks in the episode \\"Heal Thyself\\" shedding light on Dr. Catherine Banfield's (played by Angela Bassett) past.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 13, 2008, over 6 years after his exit from the show, Anthony Edwards returned as Dr. Mark Greene. The flashback episode took place in 2002, just months before Greene's death and revealed an encounter he had with Catherine Banfield, 6 years before she began working in that same emergency room. He was treating Banfield's son Darryl who had a debilitating disease which turned out to be leukemia. The story appeared to take place at the point in Season 8 when Mark and Elizabeth were reconciling after she learned his tumor had recurred. Mark takes on the mysterious case to save the 5 year old. He has a run-in with Kerry Weaver and Robert Romano about putting this case ahead of his chemo treatment which took a toll on him throughout that day. Darryl dies in the ER but it was Mark's heroic actions that triggered Catherine in the present day to help save a young girl from drowning, and may have also inspired her to work full-time at County. During their encounter, Cate kept pressing Mark, who told her to stop being a doctor and to start being a mother. Cate gave the same advice to the young girl's mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the season 15 episode The Book of Abby, long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Among them, the tag \\"Greene\\" can be seen.","input":"What season of er did mark greene died?"},{"output":"twenty-seven themed resort hotels","context":"Coordinates: 282307N 813350W? / ?28.385233N 81.563874W? / 28.385233; -81.563874\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Resort, commonly known as Walt Disney World, or often just as Disney World, is an entertainment complex in Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, Florida, near Orlando and Kissimmee, Florida.

The property covers 27,258 acres (43?sq?mi; 110?km2), featuring four theme parks, two water parks, twenty-seven themed resort hotels, nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center Disney Springs.\\r\\nDesigned to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955, the complex was developed by Walt Disney in the 1960s. \\"The Florida Project\\", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its own diverse set of attractions. Walt Disney's original plans also called for the inclusion of an \\"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\\" (EPCOT), a planned community intended to serve as a test bed for new city living innovations. After extensive lobbying, the government of Florida created the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special government district that essentially gave The Walt Disney Company the standard powers and autonomy of an incorporated city. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during construction of the complex. Without Disney spearheading the construction, the company created a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning experimental concepts for a planned community. Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by Epcot in 1982, Disney's Hollywood Studios in 1989, and the most recent, Disney's Animal Kingdom in 1998.\\r\\nToday, Walt Disney World is the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of over 52 million.[2] The resort is the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise, and has become a popular staple in American culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1959, Walt Disney Productions began looking for land to house a second resort to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955. Market surveys at the time revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the Mississippi River, where 75% of the population of the United States lived. Additionally, Walt Disney disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland and wanted more control over a larger area of land in the next project.[3]\\r\\nWalt Disney flew over a potential site in Orlando, Florida ÿ one of many ÿ in November 1963. After witnessing the well-developed network of roads and taking the planned construction of both Interstate 4 and Florida's Turnpike into account, with McCoy Air Force Base (later Orlando International Airport) to the east, Disney selected a centrally-located site near Bay Lake.[4] To avoid a burst of land speculation, Walt Disney World Company used various dummy corporations to acquire 30,500 acres (48?sq?mi; 123?km2) of land.[4] In May 1965, some of these major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of Orlando in Osceola County. In addition, two large tracts totaling $1.5 million were sold, and smaller tracts of flatlands and cattle pastures were purchased by exotically-named companies such as the \\"Ayefour Corporation\\", \\"Latin-American Development and Management Corporation\\" and the \\"Reedy Creek Ranch Corporation\\". Some are now memorialized on a window above Main Street, U.S.A. in Magic Kingdom. The smaller parcels of land acquired were called \\"outs\\". They were 5-acre (2?ha) lots platted in 1912 by the Munger Land Company and sold to investors. Most of the owners in the 1960s were happy to get rid of the land, which was mostly swamp at the time. Another issue was the mineral rights to the land, which were owned by Tufts University. Without the transfer of these rights, Tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals. Eventually, Disney's team negotiated a deal with Tufts to buy the mineral rights for $15,000.[5]\\r\\nWorking strictly in secrecy, real estate agents unaware of their client's identity began making offers to landowners in April 1964 in parts of southwest Orange and northwest Osceola counties. The agents were careful not to reveal the extent of their intentions, and they were able to negotiate numerous land contracts with some including large tracts of land for as little as $100 an acre.[6] With the understanding that the recording of the first deeds would trigger intense public scrutiny, Disney delayed the filing of paperwork until a large portion of the land was under contract.[7]\\r\\nEarly rumors and speculation about the land purchases assumed possible development by NASA in support of the nearby Kennedy Space Center, as well as references to other famous investors such as Ford, the Rockefellers, and Howard Hughes.[7] An Orlando Sentinel news article published weeks later on May 20, 1965, acknowledged a popular rumor that Disney was building an \\"East Coast\\" version of Disneyland. However, the publication denied its accuracy based on an earlier interview with Disney at Kennedy Space Center, in which he claimed a $50 million investment was in the works for Disneyland, and that he had no interest in building a new park.[7] In October 1965, editor Emily Bavar from the Sentinel visited Disneyland during the park's 10th-anniversary celebration. In an interview with Disney, she asked him if he was behind recent land purchases in Central Florida; Bavar later described that Disney \\"looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face\\" before denying the story.[7] His reaction, combined with other research obtained during her Anaheim visit, led Bavar to author a story on October 21, 1965, where she predicted that Disney was building a second theme park in Florida.[7] Three days later after gathering more information from various sources, the Sentinel published another article headlined, \\"We Say: 'Mystery Industry' Is Disney\\".[7]\\r\\nWalt Disney had originally planned to publicly reveal Disney World on November 15, 1965, but in light of the Sentinel story, Disney asked Florida Governor Haydon Burns to confirm the story on October 25. His announcement called the new theme park \\"the greatest attraction in the history of Florida\\".[7] The official reveal was kept on the previously-planned November 15 date, and Disney joined Burns in Orlando for the event.[7]\\r\\nWalt Disney died from circulatory collapse caused by lung cancer on December 15, 1966, before his vision was realized. His brother and business partner, Roy O. Disney, postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase.\\r\\nOn February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a press conference at the Park Theatres in Winter Park, Florida. The role of EPCOT was emphasized in the film that was played. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the Reedy Creek Improvement District with two cities inside it, Bay Lake and Reedy Creek, now Lake Buena Vista. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include the issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections.[3] The legislation forming the district and the two cities was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967.[8] The Supreme Court of Florida then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district, despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions.\\r\\nThe district soon began construction of drainage canals, and Disney built the first roads and the Magic Kingdom. The Contemporary Resort Hotel and Polynesian Village were also completed in time for the park's opening on October 1, 1971.[9][10] The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before, while Fort Wilderness opened a month later. 24 days after the park opened, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as \\"Walt Disney World\\" in his brother's honor. In his own words: \\"Everyone has heard of Ford cars. But have they all heard of Henry Ford, who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here.\\" After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, Lillian, what she thought of Walt Disney World. According to biographer Bob Thomas, she responded, \\"I think Walt would have approved.\\" Roy Disney died at age 78 on December 20, 1971, less than three months after the property opened.[11]\\r\\nAdmission prices in 1971 were $3.50 for adults, $2.50 for juniors under age 18, and one dollar for children under twelve.[9]\\r\\nMuch of Walt Disney's plans for his Progress City were abandoned after his death and after the company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city. The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, EPCOT Center,which opened in 1982 (renamed EPCOT in 1996). While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, the park is closer to a world's fair than a \\"community of tomorrow\\". One of EPCOT's main attractions is their world's showcase which highlights 11 countries across the globe. Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of Celebration much later. The resort's third theme park, Disney-MGM Studios (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989 and is inspired by show business. The resort's fourth theme park, Disney's Animal Kingdom, opened in 1998.\\r\\nGeorge Kalogridis was named president of the resort in December 2012, replacing Meg Crofton, who had overseen the site since 2006.\\r\\nOn January 21, 2016, the resort's management structure was changed, with general managers within a theme park being in charge of an area or land, instead of on a functional basis as previously. Theme parks have already had a vice-president overseeing them. Disney Springs and Disney Sports were also affected. Now hotel general managers manage a single hotel instead of some managing multiple hotels.[12]\\r\\nOn October 18, 2017, it was announced that resort visitors could bring dogs to Disneys Yacht Club Resort, Disney Port Orleans Resort ÿ Riverside, Disneys Art of Animation Resort and Disneys Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground.[13]\\r\\nThe resort has a number of expansion projects planned or ongoing, including:\\r\\nThe Florida resort is not within Orlando city limits but is southwest of Downtown Orlando. Much of the resort is in southwestern Orange County, with the remainder in adjacent Osceola County. The property includes the cities of Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake which are governed by the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The site is accessible from Central Florida's Interstate 4 via Exits 62B (World Drive), 64B (US 192 West), 65B (Osceola Parkway West), 67B (SR 536 West), and 68 (SR 535 North), and Exit 8 on SR 429, the Western Expressway. At its founding, the park occupied approximately 30,500 acres (48?sq?mi; 123?km2). Portions of the property have since been sold or de-annexed, including land now occupied by the Disney-built community of Celebration. Now the resort occupies 27,258 acres (43?sq?mi; 110?km2),[17] about the size of San Francisco, or twice the size of Manhattan.\\r\\nCinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom\\r\\nSpaceship Earth at Epcot\\r\\nThe Chinese Theatre at Disney's Hollywood Studios\\r\\nTree of Life at Disney's Animal Kingdom\\r\\nDisney's property includes four golf courses. The three 18-hole golf courses are Disney's Palm (4.5 stars), Disney's Magnolia (4 stars), and Disney's Lake Buena Vista (4 stars). There is also a nine-hole walking course (no electric carts allowed) called Oak Trail, designed for young golfers. The Magnolia and Palm courses played home to the PGA Tour's Children's Miracle Network Hospitals Classic. Arnold Palmer Golf Management manages the Disney golf courses.[20]\\r\\nAdditionally, there are two themed miniature golf complexes, each with two courses, Fantasia Gardens and Winter Summerland.[21] The two courses at Fantasia Gardens are Fantasia Garden and Fantasia Fairways. The Garden course is a traditional miniature-style course based on the \\"Fantasia\\" movies with musical holes, water fountains and characters. Fantasia Fairways is a traditional golf course on miniature scale having water hazards and sand traps.[22]\\r\\nThe two courses at Winter Summerland are Summer and Winter, both themed around Santa. Summer is the more challenging of the two 18-hole courses.[22]\\r\\nOf the thirty-four resorts and hotels on the Walt Disney World property, twenty-eight are owned and operated by Walt Disney Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products. These are classified into four categories? Deluxe, Moderate, Value, and Disney Vacation Club Villas? and are located in one of five resort areas: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Wide World of Sports, Animal Kingdom, or Disney Springs resort areas.\\r\\nWhile all of the Deluxe resort hotels have achieved an AAA Four Diamond rating, Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa is considered the highest tier flagship luxury resort on the Walt Disney World Resort complex.[25]\\r\\nThe Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, Walt Disney World's flagship resort\\r\\nDisney's Polynesian Resort, a deluxe level resort\\r\\nCaribbean Beach Resort, the first moderate resort at Walt Disney World\\r\\nFort Wilderness, Disney's campground and cabin resort\\r\\nDisney's All Star Movies Resort, one of five value resorts\\r\\nShades of Green Resort, owned and operated by the United States Military\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Dolphin\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Swan\\r\\nThe Hilton at Walt Disney World, located at Hotel Plaza Boulevard\\r\\nGuests with a Disney Resort reservation (excluding the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin) that arrive at Orlando International Airport can be transported to their resort from the airport using the complimentary Disney Magical Express service, which is operated by Mears Destination Services. Guests can also have their bags picked up and transported to their resort for them through a contract with BAGS Incorporated on participating airlines. Many resorts feature Airline Check-in counters for guests returning to the airport. Here their bags will be checked all the way through to their final destination and they can also have boarding passes printed for them. Some participating airlines are Delta, United, American, Jet Blue, and Alaska Airlines.\\r\\nIn 2014, the resort's four theme parks all ranked in the top 8 on the list of the 25 most visited theme parks in the world; (1st) Magic Kingdom - 19,332,000 visitors, (6th) Epcot - 11,454,000 visitors, (7th) Disney's Animal Kingdom - 10,402,000 visitors, and (8th) Disney's Hollywood Studios - 10,312,000 visitors.[27]\\r\\nThe Walt Disney World Resort is serviced by Disney Transport, a complimentary mass transportation system allowing guest access across the property. The Walt Disney World Monorail System provides free transportation at Walt Disney World. Guests can aboard the monorail from select on property resorts including The Grand Floridian and The Polynesian. The system operates on three routes that interconnect at the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC), adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. A fleet of Disney-operated buses on property, branded Disney Transport, is also complimentary for guests.\\r\\nDisney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from water taxis, up to the ferries that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center. Disney Transport is also responsible for maintaining the fleet of parking lot trams that are used for shuttling visitors between the various theme park parking lots and their respective main entrances.\\r\\nWalt Disney World previously had its own small airport: the Walt Disney World Airport which was also known as the Lake Buena Vista STOLport. During the early 1970s, scheduled passenger service was operated by Shawnee Airlines with small de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter commuter turboprops which had STOL (short take off and landing) capabilities on flights to Tampa and Orlando.[38][39] The airport is no longer in operation.\\r\\nWhen the Magic Kingdom opened in 1971, the site employed about 5,500 \\"cast members\\".[40] Today, Walt Disney World employs more than 74,000 cast members,[41] spending more than $1.2 billion on payroll and $474 million on benefits each year. The largest single-site employer in the United States,[42][43] Walt Disney World has more than 3,700 job classifications. The resort also sponsors and operates the Walt Disney World College Program, an internship program that offers American college students (CP's) the opportunity to live about 15 miles (24?km) off-site in four Disney-owned apartment complexes and work at the resort, and thereby provides much of the theme park and resort \\"front line\\" cast members. There is also the Walt Disney World International College Program, an internship program that offers international college students (ICP's) from all over the world the same opportunity.\\r\\nWalt Disney Worlds corporate culture uses jargon based on theatrical terminology.[44][45] For example, park visitors are always guests, employees are called cast members, rides are attractions or adventures, cast members costumed as famous Disney characters in a way that does not cover their faces are known as face characters, jobs are roles, and public and nonpublic areas are respectively labeled onstage and backstage.[44][45]\\r\\nDisney's security personnel are generally dressed in typical security guard uniforms, though some of the personnel are dressed as tourists in plain clothes. Since September 11, 2001, uniformed security has been stationed just outside each Disney park in Florida to search guests' bags as they enter the parks.\\r\\nThe land where Walt Disney World resides is part of the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID), a governing jurisdiction created in 1967 by the State of Florida at the request of Disney. RCID provides 911 services, fire, environmental protection, building code enforcement, utilities and road maintenance but does not provide law enforcement services. The approximately 800 security staff are instead considered employees of the Walt Disney Company. Arrests and citations are issued by the Florida Highway Patrol along with the Orange County and Osceola County sheriffs deputies who patrol the roads. Disney security does maintain a fleet of security vans equipped with flares, traffic cones, and chalk commonly used by police officers. These security personnel are charged with traffic control by the RCID and may only issue personnel violation notices to Disney and RCID employees, not the general public.[46][47]\\r\\nDespite the appearance of the uniformed security personnel, they are not considered a legal law enforcement agency. Disney and The Reedy Creek Improvement District were sued for access to Disney Security records by Bob and Kathy Sipkema following the death of their son at the resort in 1994. The court characterized Disney security as a \\"night watchman\\" service not a law enforcement agency and was not subject to Florida's open records laws. An appeals court later upheld the lower court's ruling.[48]\\r\\nIn late 2015, Disney confirmed the addition of randomized secondary screenings and dogs trained to detect body-worn explosives within parks, in addition to metal detectors at entrances. It has also increased the number of uniformed security personnel at Walt Disney World and Disneyland properties.[49]\\r\\nDisney Security personnel in Florida have investigated traffic accidents and issued accident reports. The forms used by Disney Security may be confused with official, government forms by some.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Orange County Sheriff maintains an office on Disney property, but this is primarily to process guests accused of shoplifting by Disney security personnel.[50]","input":"How many resorts are at walt disney world?"},{"output":"separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas","context":"The decision to effect the Partition of Bengal (Bengali: ????????) was announced on 19 July 1905 by the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon. The partition took place on 16 October 1905 and separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas. The Hindus of West Bengal who dominated Bengal's business and rural life complained that the division would make them a minority in a province that would incorporate the province of Bihar and Orissa.[1] Hindus were outraged at what they recognised as a \\"divide and rule\\" policy,[2] where the colonisers turned the native population against itself in order to rule, even though Curzon stressed it would produce administrative efficiency. The partition animated the Muslims to form their own national organization on communal lines. Bengal was reunited by Lord Hardinge in 1911 in an effort to appease Bengali sentiment. It was reunited for the following reasons: 1. Swadeshi movement riots protested against it. 2. Hindus thought the east Bengal would have their own courts and policies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provincial state of Bengal had an area of 189,000?mi2 and a population of nearly 78.5?million. It comprised to West Bengal with a Hindu majority and East Bengal and Assam with a Muslim majority. It included the Hindi-speaking regions of Bihar, the Odia-speaking regions of Odisha as well as the Assamese-speaking region of Assam, making it a huge administrative entity. Moreover, the capital, Calcutta, was also the capital of the entire British India. With the growing efforts of the Indian freedom fighters to secure the independence of India, Lord Curzon decided to address both these problems by partitioning Bengal into two entities, which would result in a Muslim-majority in the eastern half, and a Hindu-majority in the western half. This he hoped would reduce the administrative pressures.\\r\\nThe government announced the idea for partition in January 1904. The idea was opposed by Henry John Stedman Cotton, Chief Commissioner of Assam (1896ÿ1902).\\r\\nThe partition was made on 16 October, by Viceroy Curzon, and Cayan Uddin Ahmet, the Chief Secretary of Bengal. The former province of Bengal was divided into two new provinces \\"Bengal\\" (comprising western Bengal as well as the province of Bihar and Orissa) and Eastern Bengal and Assam with Dacca as the capital of the latter.[3] Partition was promoted for administrative reasons since Bengal was geographically as large as France and had a significantly larger population. Curzon stated the eastern region was neglected and under-governed. By splitting the province, an improved administration could be established in the east, where subsequently, the population would benefit from new schools and employment opportunities.\\r\\nThe partition was generally supported by the Muslims of East Bengal by both their poor economic conditions in East Bengal and the perceived dominance of the Hindu businessmen and landlords in West Bengal over the governance of Bengal. Most of the factories and mills in Bengal were established in and around Calcutta, while many sources of raw materials for these factories were in East Bengal. Furthermore, most of the educational institutions of the Province were in Calcutta, including the lone university in Bengal.\\r\\nThe scars resulting from the partition of Bengal have never completely healed and can still be seen today.\\r\\nGiven below is the proclamation of partition:\\r\\n\\"The Governor-General is pleased to constitute the territories at present under the administration of the Chief Commissioner of Assam to be for the purposes of the Indian Councils Act 1861... a province to which the provisions of that Act touching the making of laws and regulations for the peace and good order of the presidencies of Fort St. George and Bombay shall be applicable and to direct that the said province shall be called and known as the province of Eastern Bengal and Assam.... The Governor-General in Council is pleased to specify the sixteenth day of October, 1905 as the period at which the said provisions shall take effect and 15th as the number of councilors whom the Lieutenant-Governor may nominate for his assistance in making laws and regulations. The Governor-General in Council is further pleased to declare and appoint that upon the constitution of the said province of Eastern Bengal and Assam, the districts of Dacca, Mymensingh, Faridpur, Backergunge, Tippera, Noakhali, Chittagong, the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Rajashahi, Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Rangpur, Bogra, Pabna, and Malda which now form part of the Bengal Division of the Presidency of Fort William shall cease to be subject to or included within the limits of that Division, and shall thenceforth be subject to and included within the limits of the Lieutenant-Governorship of the province of Eastern Bengal and Assam.\\"\\r\\nThe reason behind the partition that was officially announced was that the Bengal province was too large to be administered by a single governor and so it would be partitioned on administrative purpose. The real reason behind the partition was political and not administrative. East Bengal was dominated by the Muslims and West Bengal by the Hindus. Partition was yet another part of the divide and rule policy. The following excerpts from Curzon's letter of 2 February 1905 to St. John Brodrick, Secretary of State for India, give an idea of his aims in partitioning Bengal:\\r\\n\\"Calcutta is the centre from which the Congress Party is manipulated throughout the whole of Bengal, and indeed the whole of India. Its best wire pullers and its most frothy orators all reside here. The perfection of their machinery, and the tyranny which it enables them to exercise are truly remarkable. They dominate public opinion in Calcutta; they affect the High Court; they frighten the local Government, and they are sometimes not without serious influence on the Government of India. The whole of their activity is directed to creating an agency so powerful that they may one day be able to force a weak government to give them what they desire. Any measure in consequence that would divide the Bengali-speaking population; that would permit independent centres of activity and influence to grow up; that would dethrone Calcutta from its place as the center of successful intrigue, or that would weaken the influence of the lawyer class, who have the entire organisation in their hands, is intensely and hotly resented by them. The outcry will be loud and very fierce, but as a native gentleman said to me?ÿ 'my countrymen always howl until a thing is settled; then they accept it'.\\"\\r\\nPartition sparked an extremely major political crisis along religious lines. Hindu resistance exploded as the Indian National Congress began the Swadeshi movement that included boycotting British goods and public institutions, meetings and processions, forming committees, propaganda through press, and diplomatic pressure. Hitherto untouched sections of Indian society participated in these movements, providing base for later movements. Richness of the movement extended to culture, science and literature. Masses were educated for a bolder form of politics and colonial hegemony was undermined. The Muslims in East Bengal hoped that a separate region would give them more control over education and employment, hence, they opposed those movements.[4] Rabindranath Tagore wrote Banglar Mati Banglar Jol as a rallying cry for proponents of annulment of Partition.[5]\\r\\nOpposition to the partition was supported by Henry John Stedman Cotton who had been Chief Commissioner of Assam, but Curzon was not to be moved. Later, Cotton, now Liberal MP for Nottingham East coordinated the successful campaign to oust the first lieutenant- governor of East Bengal, Sir Bampfylde Fuller.\\r\\nDue to these political protests, the two parts of Bengal were reunited on 12 December 1911. A new partition which divided the province on linguistic, rather than religious grounds followed, with the Hindi, Oriya and Assamese areas separated to form separate administrative units: Bihar and Orissa Province was created to the west, and Assam Province to the east. The administrative capital of British India was moved from Calcutta to New Delhi as well.\\r\\nIn 1909, separate elections were established for Muslims and Hindus. Before this, many members of both communities had advocated national solidarity of all Bengalis. With separate electorates, distinctive political communities developed, with their own political agendas. Muslims, too, dominated the Legislature, due to their overall numerical strength of roughly twenty two to twenty eight million. Nationally, Hindus and Muslims began to demand the creation of two independent states, one to be formed in majority Hindu and one in majority Muslim areas.[6]\\r\\nIn 1947, Bengal was partitioned for the second time, solely on religious grounds, as part of the Partition of India following the formation of the nations India and Pakistan.[7] In 1947, East Bengal became East Pakistan, and in 1971 became the independent state of Bangladesh after a successful war of independence with West Pakistan.[8]\\r\\nThe partition left a significant impact on the people of Bengal as well as the political scene of the Indian subcontinent. This event also created a sense of political awareness among the Muslims of East Bengal. To mollify the people of East Bengal, Lord Curzon declared that a university as a center of excellence would be established in Dacca (which would later be named as University of Dhaka) and formed a committee in this regard consisting Khwaja Salimullah, A. K. Fazlul Huq and others. The decision was severely criticised by some Hindu leaders in West Bengal. The most significant impact of this event was greater communal dissonance between the Hindus and Muslims of Bengal.","input":"What was the result of the partition of bengal?"},{"output":"Mark Jackson","context":"\\r\\nThe Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in Oakland, California. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. The Warriors play their home games at the Oracle Arena in Oakland. The Warriors have reached nine NBA Finals, winning five NBA championships in 1947,[b] 1956, 1975, 2015 and 2017. Golden State's five NBA championships are tied for fourth-most in NBA history with the San Antonio Spurs, and behind only the Boston Celtics (17), Los Angeles Lakers (16) and Chicago Bulls (6). As of 2017, the Warriors are the third most valuable NBA franchise according to Forbes, with an estimated value of $2.6?billion.[6]\\r\\nThe team was established in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a founding member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1962, the franchise relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area and was renamed the San Francisco Warriors. In 1971, the team changed its geographic moniker to Golden State, California's state nickname.[7][c] The team is nicknamed the Dubs as a shortening of \\"W's\\".[8][9]\\r\\nWilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry have both been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the Warriors, for a total of three MVP awards. 18 Hall of Famers have played for the Warriors, while four have coached the team. Golden State holds the NBA records for best regular season with 73ÿ9 and most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined) with 88 in 2015-16, as well as best postseason with 16ÿ1 (.941 winning percentage) in 2016-17.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America. They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League.[10] Tyrrell hired Eddie Gottlieb, a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager.[11] The owners named the team after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in 1925.[12]\\r\\nLed by early scoring sensation Joe Fulks, the team won the championship in the league's inaugural 1946ÿ47 season by defeating the Chicago Stags, four games to one. The NBA, which was created by a 1949 merger, officially recognizes that as its own first championship.[b] Gottlieb bought the team in 1951.\\r\\nThe Warriors won its other championship in Philadelphia in the 1955ÿ56 season, defeating the Fort Wayne Pistons four games to one. The Warrior stars of this era were future Hall of Famers Paul Arizin, Tom Gola and Neil Johnston. In 1959, the team signed draft pick Wilt Chamberlain. Known as \\"Wilt the Stilt\\", he led the team in scoring six times, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the NBA style of play forever. On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior \\"home\\" game played on a neutral court in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain scored 100 points against the New York Knicks, a single-game record the NBA ranks among its finest moments.[13]\\r\\nIn 1962, Franklin Mieuli purchased the majority shares of the team and relocated the franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area, renaming them the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City (the facility lies just south of the San Francisco city limits) from 1962 to 1964 and the San Francisco Civic Auditorium from 1964 to 1966, though occasionally playing home games in nearby cities such as Oakland and San Jose.\\r\\nPrior to the 1963ÿ64 NBA season, the Warriors drafted big man Nate Thurmond to go along with Chamberlain. The Warriors won the Western Division crown that season, but lost the 1964 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics, four games to one. In the 1964ÿ65 season, the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the Philadelphia 76ers for Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer, Paul Neumann and $150,000 and won only 17 games. In 1965, they drafted Rick Barry in the first round who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the NBA finals in the 1966ÿ67 season, losing (four games to two) to Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the 76ers.\\r\\nAngered by management's failure to pay him certain incentive bonuses he felt were due him, Barry sat out the 1967ÿ68 season and signed with the Oakland Oaks of the rival American Basketball Association for the following year, but after four seasons in the ABA rejoined the Warriors in 1972. During Barry's absence, the Warriors were no longer title contenders, and the mantle of leadership fell to Thurmond, Jeff Mullins and Rudy LaRusso. They began scheduling more home games in Oakland with the opening of the Oakland Coliseum Arena in 1966 and the 1970ÿ71 season would be the team's last as the San Francisco Warriors.\\r\\nThe franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the 1971ÿ72 season, in order to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California.[7][c] Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City. Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971.\\r\\nThe Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on the West Coast in 1974ÿ75. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored Washington Bullets but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior Al Attles, and led on the court by Rick Barry and Jamaal Wilkes. Barry was named MVP of the finals.[14]\\r\\nAt 59-23, the Warriors had the league's best record during the 1975ÿ76 season. They were upset, however, by the 42-40 Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\\r\\nBecause of the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll. In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent Bernard King, but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson, whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric \\"Sleepy\\" Floyd, and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson. (Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets).\\r\\nThe departure of these players for various reasons symbolized the franchise's futility during this period, as head coach Attles moved up to the front office as general manager in 1980 and the team made several coaching changes. New owners Jim Fitzgerald and Dan Finane finally managed to return the team to respectability by hiring former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach George Karl as head coach in 1986 after selecting St. John's small forward Chris Mullin in the 1985 NBA draft.\\r\\nAfter a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers which is still shown on TV in the NBA's Greatest Games series. In the game, Warriors' All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd's performance in the second half still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors.\\r\\nThe \\"Sleepy Floyd game\\" was a catalyst for increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area which was furthered by new coach Don Nelson, who engineered another successful string of wins in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the high-scoring trio of point guard Tim Hardaway, guard Mitch Richmond and forward Chris Mullin (collectively known as \\"Run TMC\\" after the rap group Run-D.M.C.). But \\"Run TMC\\" stayed together for only two seasons (winning only one playoff series), when coach Nelson, in a move to get a promising young front-court player to complement his run-and-gun system, sent Richmond to the Sacramento Kings for rookie power forward Billy Owens. Nelson had been brought to the Warriors from the Milwaukee Bucks by Jim Fitzgerald, who along with Dan Finnane owned the team between 1986 and 1995. In 1993ÿ94, with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year power forward Chris Webber playing alongside off-guard Latrell Sprewell, the Warriors made the playoffs.\\r\\nAt the start of the next season, however, a rift formed between Webber and Sprewell on the one hand and Nelson on the other. All three soon left the team, and the organization went into a tailspin. 1994ÿ95 was the first season under new team owner Chris Cohan, who had bought out Fitzgerald and Finnane. The Warriors selected power forward prospect Joe Smith as their first overall draft pick in 1995 and hired Rick Adelman as the new head coach. They sent Tim Hardaway and Chris Gatling to the Miami Heat for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles midway through the 1995ÿ96 season, and ended up with a 36ÿ46 record, three wins short of making the playoffs. While their home court, the Oakland Coliseum Arena, was being extensively renovated, the 1996ÿ97 Warriors played their home games in the San Jose Arena and struggled to a 30ÿ52 finish.[15]\\r\\nLongtime Seton Hall college coach P. J. Carlesimo, who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers, replaced Adelman as head coach for 1997ÿ98. Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the 1997ÿ98 season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline \\"WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM\\" and the declaration by GM Garry St. Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again. He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.\\r\\nSt. Jean had become the new Warriors' GM in July 1997; he and his predecessor Dave Twardzik received much of the blame for the Warriors' struggles early in Cohan's turbulent tenure as owner in addition to Cohan himself.[16] St. Jean brought in players such as Terry Cummings, John Starks and Mookie Blaylock who were well past their primes. Twardzik drafted several flops, such as Todd Fuller (while Kobe Bryant was still available as well as Steve Nash and Jermaine O'Neal) and Steve Logan (who never played an NBA game). In the following draft, the team selected Adonal Foyle while Tracy McGrady was still available. St. Jean did, however, draft future two-time NBA slam dunk champion off-guard Jason Richardson (from Michigan State), a Warriors' star scorer through the 2006ÿ07 season.\\r\\nFor a few years, with rising stars Richardson, small forward Antawn Jamison and point guard Gilbert Arenas leading the team, the Warriors seemed like a team on the rise; but the young Warriors did not have enough in the competitive Western Conference to make the playoffs. After the 2002ÿ03 season, St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like Danny Fortson, Adonal Foyle and Erick Dampier were painfully felt by Warriors' fans when the team was unable to re-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars. Chris Mullin succeeded St. Jean with the title of Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations in 2004. He hoped to build a winning team around Jason Richardson, Mike Dunleavy Jr and Troy Murphy, and drafted 7-foot center Andris Biedri?? from Latvia (11th overall). At the 2005 trading deadline, he bolstered to the team with the acquisition of point guard Baron Davis, bringing to the team its first superstar since Mullin himself. The Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005ÿ06 season, entering the new year with a plus .500 winning percentage for the first time since 1994, but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries. Davis often found himself at odds with new head coach Mike Montgomery (used to dealing with college players in his long tenure at Stanford) and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, 2006, the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention in a 114ÿ109 overtime loss to the Hornets, extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons.\\r\\nEntering the 2006ÿ07 season, the Warriors held the active record (12) for the most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance (see Active NBA non-playoff appearance streaks). During the 2006 off-season, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of coach Montgomery's contract and hired previous Golden State and former Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson to take over for him. During training camp, small forward Matt Barnes established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, the Warriors traded the disappointing Murphy and Dunleavy with promising young power forward Ike Diogu and Keith McLeod to the Indiana Pacers for forward Al Harrington, forward/guard Stephen Jackson, guard ?arnas Jasikevi?ius and forward Josh Powell.[17] This trade allowed the Warriors to \\"run and gun\\" their way to the playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. On March 4, 2007, the Warriors suffered a 106ÿ107 loss in Washington, the Wizards handing them their 6th straight loss when former Warrior Arenas hit a technical free throw with less than one second remaining after Nelson had protested a controversial call with the Warriors ahead by a slim margin. The loss dropped them to 26ÿ35.\\r\\nMarch 4 marked the turning point for the Warriors. The Warriors closed out the regular season (42ÿ40) at 16ÿ5 in their last 21 games.[18] \\"We Believe\\" became the Warriors' slogan for the last two months of the season and the playoffs.[19]\\r\\nLed by a healthy Baron Davis, an ever-improving Jason Richardson and young future star off-guard Monta Ellis as well as center Biedri??, the Warriors immediately dashed the highly favored top-seed Dallas Mavericks' expectations of a short and easy series win with a Game 1 victory in Dallas thanks to Davis' frantic style of play. The Mavericks came back to win Game 2 easily to tie the series at a game apiece, but the Warriors won both Games 3 & 4 with a huge lift from the home crowd at Oracle Arena. A close Game 5 saw the Mavericks eke out a 118ÿ112 victory with a last-minute surge led by superstar forward Dirk Nowitzki to send the series back to California at 3ÿ2. In Game 6, the Warriors engineered a third-quarter 18ÿ0 run to eliminate the Mavericks and become the NBA's first No.?8 seed to beat a No.?1 seed in a seven-game series (and the first NBA No.?8 seed to beat the top seed since 1999 when the New York Knicks eliminated the Miami Heat). It was an upset in name only, given the fact that the Warriors had swept the Mavericks in the regular season series.\\r\\nThe Warriors went on to play the Utah Jazz in the second round of the 2006ÿ07 playoffs, where they dropped two close games at EnergySolutions Arena to open the series. The series then shifted to the Oracle Arena, where the Warriors won Game 3 in a convincing blowout. Davis scored 32 points and electrified the crowd with a monster dunk on Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko late in the fourth quarter, but they lost Game 4 at home, their first loss in Oakland in well over a month and the Jazz closed them out in Game 5 in Salt Lake City.\\r\\nThe Warriors faced early difficulties in their attempt to return to the playoffs. Richardson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for rookie Brandan Wright. To make things even worse, Jackson was suspended for seven games over a firearm incident. They opened the 2007ÿ08 season with six straight losses, but Ellis' rise, Davis' solid injury-free season (21.6 points, 8 assists, 4.6 rebounds per game),[20] and an overall improvement in team chemistry brought them back to playoff contention; but in the end the Warriors failed to make the playoffs despite a 48ÿ34 season, which is the best record in NBA history for a non-playoff team since the NBA playoffs had expanded to eight teams per conference. The Western Conference was very strong that season; every playoff team won 50 games, leaving the Warriors two games out of the last playoff spot. The Warriors sold out nearly every home game during the season averaging 19,631 per game, the highest in team history.\\r\\nIn the offseason, Baron Davis opted to return to his home town and sign with the Los Angeles Clippers. With the 14th pick of the 2008 NBA draft, the Warriors selected and signed Anthony Randolph out of LSU. To compensate for the loss of Davis, the Warriors signed free agents Corey Maggette and Ronny Turiaf and re-signed Ellis and Andris Biedri?? to long-term contracts.\\r\\nThe Warriors had a disappointing 2008ÿ2009 season, finishing 29ÿ53. Ellis was injured in a moped accident, and suspended for 30 games for riding the vehicle against the terms of his contract, depriving the Warriors of their top player. They traded disenchanted forward Al Harrington to the New York Knicks for guard Jamal Crawford, and were undone by injuries and the minimal experience of their young players such as Anthony Morrow and Brandan Wright. Coach Nelson often had to make adjustments to the starting lineups since many of the original starters missed games due to injuries. Despite the team's losing record, the Warriors were hard to beat when they had a healthy lineup and a strong bench. With leadership and improvement in their young players, they were sometimes able to defeat powerhouse teams such as the Boston Celtics, 99-89.\\r\\nDuring the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Mullin. Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach,[21] was promoted in his place and drafted Stephen Curry as an outstanding 7th lottery pick, but dubiously traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\\r\\nThe Warriors had another injury-prone year in 2009ÿ10.[22] as they were consistently unable to field their ideal starting lineup. In November, a malcontented Stephen Jackson and seldom-used Acie Law were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for Raja Bell (out for the season with an injury) and Vladimir Radmanovic. Four days later, they signed center Chris Hunter. Starting in January 2010, they issued multiple 10-day contracts, most notably to power forward Anthony Tolliver from the Idaho Stampede. Due to their multiple injuries, they were granted an exception allowing them to sign Reggie Williams from the Sioux Falls Skyforce to a 10-day contract on March 2, making it their fifth D-League call-up that season, tying an NBA record. They eventually waived the injured Bell to sign Williams for the rest of the year, and finished the season 26ÿ56, fourth in the Pacific Division.\\r\\nOn June 24, the Warriors selected Ekpe Udoh, a power forward from Baylor, as the 6th pick of the 2010 NBA draft. They also introduced a modernized version of their \\"The City\\" logo depicting the new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and switched to a simplified color scheme of royal blue and gold. They also introduced new uniforms reminiscent of the 1969ÿ71 \\"The City\\" uniforms. The Warriors made an offseason trade that sent Turiaf, Randolph and Kelenna Azubuike to the New York Knicks in return for star high-scoring power forward David Lee via a sign-and-trade. Lee agreed to a six-year, $80?million deal, on a framework contingent on the decision of superstar forward LeBron James to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat that same day. Following Morrow's departure after he signed the New Jersey Nets' offer sheet, the Warriors signed Dorell Wright, formerly with the Miami Heat, to a three-year, $11?million deal.\\r\\nOn July 15, owner Chris Cohan sold the Warriors to Peter Guber of Mandalay Entertainment and his partner Joe Lacob for a then-record $450?million.[23] On November 15, the Warriors announced the new 19-person ownership group composed of Joe Lacob, Peter Guber, Vivek Ranadiv, Erika Glazer, Fred Harman, Bob Piccinini, Larry Bowman, Danny German, Marty Glick, Chad Hurley, Craig R. Johnson, Bruce Karsh, Jeffrey A. Miller, Paul Schaeffer, David Scially, Nick Swinmurn, Harry Tsao, John Walecka and Dennis Wong.[24]\\r\\nThe Warriors continued their signing spree by adding Harvard guard Jeremy Lin to their roster with a one-year partially guaranteed contract containing a second-year team option, the first Taiwanese-American player in NBA history. Louis Amundson was then added for little under $5?million in mid-September. Keith Smart was hired as head coach that same month after Nelson had resigned before the start of training camp.\\r\\nIn February 2011, the Warriors traded Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric for Troy Murphy and a 2011 second-round pick. On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement and he was waived.[25][26]\\r\\nDuring a steady season without making any real ground in the playoff race, the Warriors broke franchise records with 21 made 3's in a win against the Orlando Magic. In April 2011, Dorell Wright made a franchise record of 184 3's in a season in a home win versus Los Angeles Lakers, surpassing Richardson's 183 in 2005ÿ06. He then broke another NBA record, as the first player to have scored more points in his seventh season than in all his first six seasons combined in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers. He ended the season with the most three-pointers made in the NBA that season with 194, as well as the most 3s attempted with 516, both of which set new Warrior franchise records.\\r\\nThe Warriors failed to make the playoffs after a 36-win season in 2010ÿ11, and coach Smart was dismissed on April 27 due to the change in ownership.[27] 17-year NBA veteran and former ABC and ESPN commentator Mark Jackson replaced him as head coach on June 6.[28] On December 19, they traded Amundson to the Indiana Pacers for small forward Brandon Rush.\\r\\nThe Warriors did not improve in the 2011ÿ12 NBA season under coach Jackson, finishing the lockout-shorted season with a 23ÿ43 record, 13th in the conference. The team suffered several injuries to key players, and due to the lockout, Jackson could not establish his system in training camp. They then entered into another chaotic rebuilding phase.\\r\\nTeam leader Monta Ellis was traded in mid-March 2012, along with Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh, to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut (out injured for the season) and former Warrior small forward Stephen Jackson, who without playing a game for the Warriors was quickly traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Richard Jefferson and a conditional first-round pick on March 15. These moves saw the rise of Stephen Curry and David Lee to team co-captains, and saw off-guard Klay Thompson, the 11th overall pick of the 2011 NBA draft, move into a starting role. On July 11, they acquired point guard Jarrett Jack from the New Orleans Hornets in a three-team trade also including the Philadelphia 76ers, who received Dorell Wright from Golden State. On August 1, they signed forward Carl Landry on the termination of his one-year contract with the Hornets. In the 2012 NBA draft, they selected small forward Harrison Barnes with the 7th overall pick, center Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, small forward Draymond Green 35th overall, and 7-foot 1-inch center Ognjen Kuzmic 52nd overall. In early November, swingman Rush was lost for the year with a torn ACL after falling awkwardly on the court early in the second game of the season, and less than a month later the team announced that Bogut was out indefinitely with a foot injury that was more serious than originally reported. Bogut did not return to regular play until late in the season.\\r\\nComing out of this maelstrom of trades and injuries with a team starting two rookies (Barnes and Ezeli), the Warriors had one of their best starts in decades, earning their 20th win before hitting the 30-game mark for the first time since 1992. The Warriors also achieved a milestone by completing their first ever 6ÿ1 road trip in franchise history, including a 97ÿ95 win over the defending champion Heat in Miami. On April 9, 2013, with a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Warriors clinched the playoffs for the second time in 19 years and the first time since the 2006ÿ07 \\"We believe\\" Warriors. This time, the local battlecry was \\"we belong\\".\\r\\nThe team finished the season with a record of 47ÿ35, earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference, and defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs by winning four out of six games. They lost in the second round to the San Antonio Spurs, four games to two. This was the first playoff experience for all of the starters of this group except for Andrew Bogut.[29]\\r\\nOther highlights of the season included Stephen Curry's 272 three-point baskets to set an NBA single-season record, giving him the nickname \\"baby-faced assassin\\", and the naming of forward David Lee to the 2013 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve, ending the team's 16-year drought without an All Star selection, dating back to Latrell Sprewell in the 1997 season. Curry and Klay Thompson, dubbed the \\"Splash Brothers\\"[30] by team employee Brian Witt [31] for their backcourt shooting prowess, combined for 483 three-pointers during the season, easily besting the prior record of 435 set by the Orlando Magic's Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott in 1995ÿ96.\\r\\nWith their lone selection in the 2013 NBA draft, the Warriors made 22-year-old Serbian combo-guard Nemanja Nedovic the 30th and final pick of the first round.[32] In early July 2013, Golden State signed former Denver Nuggets swingman and free agent Andre Iguodala to a four-year, $48 million deal. To make room under their salary cap, the Warriors traded Richard Jefferson, Andris Biedrins and Brandon Rush, along with multiple draft picks, including their 2014 and 2017 first-round picks, to the Utah Jazz.[33] The Warriors lost free-agent guard Jarrett Jack, who departed for the Cleveland Cavaliers, and free agent power forward Carl Landry, who went to the Sacramento Kings. To help fill the void left by Landry, the Warriors signed forward-center Marreese Speights to a three-year, $10 million contract.[34] The team also signed one-year deals with veteran center Jermaine O'Neal ($2 million) and point guard Toney Douglas ($1.6 million).[35] On August 21, the Warriors signed 7?ft 1 in Serbian center Ognjen Kuzmic, who had been playing in Europe since his selection in the 2012 NBA draft, to a guaranteed two-year deal.[36][37][38]\\r\\nThe Warriors began the 2013ÿ14 season showing flashes of brilliance and also plenty of lapses. In early December their record was 12ÿ9, as compared to 17ÿ4 the year before. One challenging factor was a tough starting schedule that saw them play 14 of their first 22 games on the road, including 10 games against teams holding playoff spots in the standings. A stream of injuries also held the team back, including injuries to Festus Ezeli (off-season surgery to repair the right knee, out for the season), Toney Douglas (left tibia stress reaction, out nearly a month from mid-November to December), and Jermaine O'Neal (right wrist injury and surgery, out from mid-November to early February). Stephen Curry and Harrison Barnes were also out for at least four games before the all-star break, each with minor injuries. Most prominently of all, Iguodala suffered a hamstring pull in late November that kept him out for over a month, during which time the Warriors' performance suffered significantly on both the defensive and offensive ends of the court, and the team posted a losing 5ÿ7 record while revealing a lack of depth on their bench. With Iguodala back in the lineup, the Warriors went on a 10-game winning streak, which included six consecutive wins on a single road trip, tying an NBA record. The winning streak was the longest for the franchise since the 1975 championship year, and just one short of the team record of 11 consecutive wins, set in the 1971ÿ72 season.\\r\\nTo strengthen their underperforming bench, the Warriors made a three-team trade on January 15, sending Douglas to the Miami Heat and picking up guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks from the Boston Celtics[39] and then, a day before the trade deadline, trading Kent Bazemore and Brooks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for veteran point guard Steve Blake.[40] Thanks in part to the improved effectiveness of their backup squad, boosted by the additions of Blake and Crawford and the play of 35-year-old Jermaine O'Neal (who returned sooner than expected from wrist surgery), the Warriors were one of the winningest teams in the NBA after the all-star break. Nonetheless, and despite several victories over top contenders, the team displayed a pattern of losing games to inferior teams even at their home arena. On April 11, in a 112ÿ95 stomping of the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, the Warriors clinched a playoff berth in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. However, just one day earlier in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers, Andrew Bogut suffered a cracked rib that would keep him out of the post-season, a big blow to the sixth-seed Warriors' playoff hopes.\\r\\nThe Warriors ended the season 51ÿ31, winning more than 50 games for only the fourth time in franchise history, finishing 20 games over .500 for the first time in 22 years, and tying the 1991ÿ92 squad for the franchise's all-time mark of 24 wins on the road. Even without Bogut, in the first round of the playoffs the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game, which the Warriors lost, bringing their 2013ÿ14 season to an end. It was season of many thrilling moments in which the Warriors' played in 17 regular-season games decided by 2 points or less, 6 games with winning shots in the final 3 seconds, and 7 comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more.[41]\\r\\nIn other noteworthy occurrences for the season, Curry was named to the starting lineup for the 2014 NBA All-Star Game. For Curry, the only Warrior named to the team, this was his first all-star appearance in five seasons as an NBA player. Curry hit another notable milestone in posting 4 triple-doubles for the season, tying a franchise record unequaled since Wilt Chamberlain in 1963ÿ64. Curry also averaged career-bests in points and assists; averaging 24.0 points and 8.5 assists in the season. Curry and Klay Thompson continued to set league records in three-point shooting. On February 7, in a 102ÿ87 win over the Chicago Bulls, the backcourt duo became the first teammates to each make a three-pointer in 30 consecutive games.[42] Curry, who finished the season with 261 threes, set an individual record for most three-pointers in a span of two seasons with 533, surpassing the previous mark of 478 set by Seattle Supersonic Ray Allen in 2004ÿ05 and 2005ÿ06. Together, Thompson and Curry combined for 484 threes on the year, besting by one the NBA record they had set the year before.\\r\\nEven as the team rolled towards the post-season, signs emerged of trouble in the Warriors' front office. On March 25, the team reassigned assistant coach Brian Scalabrine to the team's NBA Development League Affiliate in Santa Cruz because of what head coach Mark Jackson called a \\"difference in philosophies\\"[43] and what unnamed league sources cited by Yahoo! Sports called \\"an increasingly dysfunctional atmosphere\\" on the Warriors' coaching staff.[44] Fewer than two weeks later, assistant coach Darren Erman was fired for secretly recording conversations between coaches, staff and players.[45] During the post season, rumors persisted in the press that Mark Jackson's job as head coach was in jeopardy, leading the players to make a unanimous declaration of support for Jackson's return only minutes after the Warriors' first-round, game seven playoff loss to the Clippers.[46] Nonetheless, three days later, on May 6, the team announced the firing of Mark Jackson as head coach.[47] In his three-season tenure as head coach, Jackson compiled a 121-109 (.526) record, overseeing a terrific turnaround. When Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had made the playoffs only one time over the prior 17 seasons, averaging 30.2 wins per season during that period.[48] Jackson, 49, became just the third head coach in franchise history to lead a team to at least 50 wins in a season, joining Don Nelson and Alvin Attles, who both hit the mark twice with the Warriors. With 121 wins overall, Jackson ranks fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Attles (557), Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263).[49] On May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors named Steve Kerr the team's head coach in a reported $25 million deal over five years.[50] It was a first-time head-coaching position for Kerr, 48, a five-time NBA champion point guard who holds the all-time career record for accuracy in three-point shooting (.454). Kerr formerly served as president and general manager for the Phoenix Suns basketball team (2007 to 2010), and had most recently been working as an NBA broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT).\\r\\nThe Warriors completed the regular season with a record of 67-15, the best in the league and the most wins in franchise history.[51] The Warriors also finished with a home record of 39ÿ2, the second best in NBA history. They were first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014ÿ15 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior to do so since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960. In the first round of the playoffs, they swept the New Orleans Pelicans, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in the second round in six games and defeated Houston Rockets in five games of the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975, where they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to win their fourth NBA title, and their first in 40 years. Andre Iguodala was named Finals MVP.[52]\\r\\nOther highlights of the season included Stephen Curry breaking his own record for three-pointers made in a single season with 286. He and Klay Thompson made a combined 525 three-pointers, the most by a duo in NBA history. In the postseason, Curry shattered Reggie Miller's record of 58 made three-pointers in a single postseason with 98. On January 23, 2015, Klay Thompson broke an NBA record for points in a quarter with 37 in the third. Curry was also the leader in the voting polls for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, won the 2014ÿ15 NBA Most Valuable Player award and the 2015 ESPYs Best Male Athlete award.\\r\\nThe Warriors began the season by winning their first 24 games, eclipsing the previous best start in NBA history, set by the 1993ÿ94 Houston Rockets and the 1948ÿ49 Washington Capitols at 15ÿ0.[53][54] The Warriors surpassed the 1969ÿ70 New York Knicks for the best road start in NBA history at 14ÿ0, which is also the joint-third longest road win streak.[55] Their record-setting start ended when they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks on December 12, 2015.[56] The Warriors broke a 131-year-old record of 20ÿ0 set by the 1884 St. Louis Maroons baseball team, to claim the best start to a season in all of the major professional sports in America. Golden State also won 28 consecutive regular-season games dating back to the 2014ÿ15 season, eclipsing the 2012ÿ13 Miami Heat for the second longest winning streak in NBA history.[54] The team set an NBA record 54-straight regular season home game winning streak, which spanned from January 31, 2015, to March 29, 2016. The previous record of 44 was held by the 1995ÿ96 Chicago Bulls team led by Michael Jordan.[57]\\r\\nStephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the All-Star Game, the first time the Warriors have had three All-Stars since 1976. Green broke the Golden State franchise record of nine triple-doubles in a season. Curry broke numerous three-point records during the season, including his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 286; he finished the season with 402 three pointers. He made a three-pointer in 151 consecutive games, which broke the NBA record of 127 set by Kyle Korver in 2014. On February 27, 2016, Curry also tied the NBA record of twelve three-pointers made in a single game, jointly holding it with Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant.[58]\\r\\nOn April 13, 2016, Golden State set the record for most wins in a single season, beating Memphis, and finishing 73-9.[59] On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes.[60] The Golden State Warriors went to their second consecutive appearance in the finals with a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[61] The Warriors went to a 3-1 advantage but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at 3 wins apiece.[62] In Game 7 the Golden State Warriors lost the championship series on their homecourt, and earned the unfortunate distinction of becoming the first team to blow a 3-1 lead in the NBA finals, as result becoming the butt of many \\"3-1 lead\\" jokes.[63][64]\\r\\nOn July 4, 2016, Kevin Durant announced he would leave the Oklahoma City Thunder in order to sign a 2-year contract with the Golden State Warriors.[65] On July 7, Durant signed his contract, which gave the Warriors a fourth All-NBA player on their team.[66] The Durant signing made the Warriors the prohibitive favorites to win the NBA championship, according to oddsmakers.[67]\\r\\nThe Warriors posted many notable achievements during the 2016ÿ17 regular season. On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13 in a 116-106 win over the Pelicans.[68] On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes in a 142ÿ106 victory over the Pacers. In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time.[69] Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars.[70] On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points.[71] On March 2, 2017, the Warriors' streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94ÿ87 loss to the Chicago Bulls. The streak eclipsed the previous record of 95 held by the Utah Jazz.[72]\\r\\nThe Warriors earned home-court advantage throughout the 2017 playoffs, thanks to a 2016ÿ17 regular season record of 67ÿ15. They were the first team in NBA playoff history to start 12ÿ0, defeating in order the Trail Blazers, the Jazz, and the Spurs. The 2017 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for three consecutive years. The Warriors won the championship after going 4ÿ1 in the Finals, and their 16ÿ1 playoff record garnered the best winning percentage (.941) in NBA playoffs history.[73]\\r\\nIn April 2014, the Warriors began the purchase process for a 12-acre site in Mission Bay, San Francisco, to hold a new 18,000-seat arena which is expected to be ready for the 2019-20 NBA season,[74][75] with construction to begin in early 2016.[76] The sale was finalized in October 2015.[77] The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views.[78] The new location, which still faces some vocal opposition in San Francisco, apparently eliminates the need for any voter approval, which would have been required with the original site.[79] Some type of waterfront park is planned across from the projected arena, which will be located at an already-existing Muni T-Third stop. The Central Subway, planned to open in 2018, may provide a direct connection between the new site and the downtown Powell Street Muni/BART station. The Golden State Warriors may consider a concurrent name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors,[80] although the team's recent success has them reconsidering that decision.[81] On January 27, 2016, it was announced that the Warriors' new arena would be called Chase Center as part of an agreement with JP Morgan Chase.[82]\\r\\nBob Fitzgerald has done television play-by-play, and former Warrior guard Jim Barnett has done color commentary for the Warriors for more than 15 years, currently on Comcast SportsNet Bay Area, where they telecast more than 70 Warrior games a year.[83] They also host Roundtable Live, a half-hour pre-game show leading up to the broadcast of select Golden State home games. Fitzgerald is in his 16th season as the Warriors' play-by-play man, while Barnett is in his 27th season as color man. Greg Papa, Garry St. Jean, and Kelenna Azubuike are also members of the telecast team, specializing in in-game, halftime and post-game analysis, while Rosalyn Gold-Onwude serves as the sideline reporter.\\r\\nTim Roye has done the radio play-by-play for Warrior games since 1995. He is joined in the booth by former Warriors forward Tom Tolbert for home games only. On August 25, 2016, the Warriors announced they were leaving long time station KNBR and all of their games will be broadcast on KGMZ.[84] After each game, Roye, Fitzgerald and Barnett get together for post-game radio analysis and a next-game preview.\\r\\nThe team trains at Rakuten Performance Center, Oakland, California.\\r\\nRoster ?

A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee, who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[86] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\\r\\n[87]\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\nArizin, Fulks, Gola, Johnston and Phillip played all or most of their tenure with the Warriors in Philadelphia.

Mason did not let that deter him: he fabricated the Nittany Lion on the spot and proclaimed that it would easily defeat the Princeton Bengal tiger.[1] The Lion's primary means of attack against the Tiger would be its strong right arm, capable of slaying any foes (this is now traditionally exemplified through one-armed push-ups after the team scores a touchdown). Upon returning to campus, he set about making his invention a reality. In 1907, he wrote in the student publication The Lemon:\\r\\n[2]\\r\\nMountain lions had roamed on nearby Mount Nittany until the 1880s.[2] The origin of the name \\"Mount Nittany\\" is obscure, the most commonly accepted explanation being that it is derived of Native American words (loosely pronounced as \\"neet-a-nee\\") named after the cougars that roamed the mountain or \\"single mountain\\" - a protective barrier against the elements.[citation needed]. The \\"original\\" nittany lion can be seen in the Penn State All-Sports Museum as the only known mounted eastern mountain lion. It was killed in Susquehanna County by Samuel Brush in 1856.[3] According to a July 1992 article in National Geographic by Maurice Hornocker titled \\"Learning to Live with Mountain Lions\\", \\"Courthouse records from Centre County, Pennsylvania, show that one local hunter killed 64 lions between 1820 and 1845.

The emissions worsen as temperature and humidity rise, will give off a sulfuric (rotten egg) odor and will cause copper surfaces to turn black and powdery, a chemical process indicative of a hydrogen sulfide reaction and an early indication of contaminated drywall. Copper pipes, electrical wiring, and air conditioner coils are affected, as well as silver jewelry.\\r\\nHomeowners have reported health symptoms including respiratory problems such as asthma attacks, chronic coughing and difficulty breathing, as well as chronic headaches and sinus issues.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDrywall (known as plasterboard in Britain) is a common building material typically made of a layer of gypsum-based plaster pressed between two thick sheets of paper and kiln-dried.\\r\\nDrywall was imported by the United States during the construction boom between 2004 and 2007, spurred by a shortage of American-made drywall due to the rebuilding demand of nine hurricanes that hit Florida from 2004 to 2005, and widespread damage caused along the Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\\r\\nAn analysis covering drywall imports since January 2006 showed that more than 550 million pounds of Chinese drywall was brought into the United States since then, enough to build 60,000 average-sized homes.[5]\\r\\nHomeowners alleging contaminated drywall have reported numerous incidents of corroding copper and other metals in their homes. The Florida Department of Health advised homeowners worried about tainted drywall to check copper tubing coils located in air conditioning and refrigeration units for signs of corrosion caused by hydrogen sulfide, as these are usually the first signs of the issue. Under normal circumstances, copper corrosion leaves it a blue/green or dark red color, whereas corrosion as a result of hydrogen sulfide exposure leaves a black ash-like corrosion. Homeowners who have verified that their home contains contaminated Chinese drywall are advised to replace any suspect drywall, as well as any potentially damaged copper electrical wiring, fire alarm systems, copper piping, and gas piping.[6]\\r\\nIn the United States, most complaints have come from states in the Southeast, where a warm and humid climate seems to encourage the emissions.[7] According to published reports, \\"Chinese drywall was used in the construction of thousands of homes, mainly in the South, after a series of hurricanes in 2005 and before the housing bubble burst.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe states of Florida (56%), Louisiana (18%), Mississippi (6%) and Alabama (6%) made up 86% of the 3,952 cases reported to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) as of April 19, 2012.[9] More than 700 complaints had been filed with the Florida Department of Health.[10][11] Sources estimated that from 60,000 to 100,000 homes could be affected.[12][13]\\r\\nKnauf Plasterboard Tianjin Co. Ltd.,[14] part of Knauf Gips KG[15] has been identified as a major producer of imported Chinese drywall. Though a number of other Chinese companies are believed to have produced defective drywall, Knauf's name comes up most frequently because the company prints its name on its products. Much of the other contaminated drywall has no markings, making it difficult to identify its origin.[16][17]\\r\\nDramatic increases in new home construction, coupled with the reconstruction effort after hurricane damage, led to a soaring increase in the quantity of imported Chinese drywall. Time magazine reports that more than 550 million pounds of drywall has been imported from China since 2006, including much from the known principal manufacturer of the contaminated drywall, Knauf. However, domestic drywall manufacturing averages over 15 million tons per year, leaving imported Chinese drywall with only a small portion of the market. It is estimated that this imported drywall has been used to construct approximately 60,000 homes.[18]\\r\\nFrom January to September 2006, 52 million pounds of Knauf drywall were unloaded in New Orleans, three-quarters of it from Knauf Tianjin, and at least 37 million pounds of Knauf drywall was shipped directly from China to Florida ports.[19]\\r\\nDrywall usually has a source printed on the back. Chinese drywall may be marked \\"Made in China\\", \\"China\\", \\"Knauf Tianjin\\", or have no marking at all. A home may have been built with drywall from several sources, American and imported.[20]\\r\\nIn April 2009, home improvement stores The Home Depot and Lowe's confirmed from their suppliers that no drywall sold in their stores was imported from China. Lowes did eventually settle lawsuits by offering up to $100,000 for each affected home but denied selling Chinese drywall.[21]\\r\\nOn November 23, 2009, CBS News reported that they had done a drywall study to compare American and Chinese drywall. Random samples of new American-made drywall in six U.S. cities, new Chinese-made drywall from China, and samples of drywall from five damaged U.S. homes were collected and sent to the University of Florida to be tested by a team of researchers led by professor Tim Townsend, a scientist and leading expert on the effects of drywall on the environment. The report results stated:\\r\\nDiscussions began in January 2009 between the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Florida officials. In February 2009, U.S. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida sent a letter to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the EPA, asking them to jointly investigate whether the Chinese drywall is toxic, and to determine the extent of potential damage to homes. The Consumer Product Safety Commission launched a formal investigation.[23]\\r\\nIn April 2009, as concerns about the defective drywall grew, Senator Nelson of Florida and Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana jointly introduced a resolution and bill urging the Consumer Product Safety Commission to recall Chinese-made drywall and temporarily ban its import.[24]\\r\\nIn May 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an amendment to the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (H.R. 1728) that would require the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to study the effects of tainted Chinese drywall on foreclosures and the availability of property insurance.[25] This measure did not pass as a standalone bill, but was incorporated into the DoddÿFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Subtitle H (Miscellaneous Provisions), Section 1494), signed into law on July 21, 2010.\\r\\nIn November 2009, the CPSC reported on an indoor air study conducted by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) comparing 41 \\"complaint\\" homes in five states with 10 control homes built around the same time. The report found a \\"strong association\\" between the imported drywall and levels of hydrogen sulfide gas and metal corrosion in the complaint homes.[26]\\r\\nLab comparisons of Chinese- and American-made drywall show significantly higher levels of pyrite in the Chinese material. This suggests that pyrite oxidation may be the source of the sulfur compounds released by Chinese drywall.[27]\\r\\nThe problems have been attributed to the use of fly ash in the drywall, which degrades in the presence of heat and moisture; although United States' drywall uses fly ash as well, the process used creates a cleaner final product.[28]\\r\\nAccording to a 2010 laboratory study, one hundred percent of affected drywall samples obtained from homes located in the southeastern United States tested positive for the presence of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, an iron and sulfur reducing bacterium. Samples of non-contaminated drywall were found to contain only minuscule levels of A. ferrooxidans.[29]\\r\\nForensic analyses suggest that disproportionation of elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide and sulfuric acid, caused by bacteria, was the primary cause of the malodors.[30]\\r\\nThere are few studies exploring the effects of long-term low-level exposure to sulfur gases. However, it is believed that short-term exposure, over the period of a few hours, can result in sore throat, eye irritation, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea. Long term exposure, over a period of weeks, is believed to cause chronic fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, dizziness, irritability, headaches, and memory loss.\\r\\nThe Center for Disease Control, in collaboration with The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry released a guide indicating the residents of affected homes reported irritated and itchy eyes and skin, difficulty breathing, persistent cough, bloody noses, runny noses, recurrent headaches, sinus infection, and asthma attacks.[4]\\r\\nThe Florida Attorney General's office has warned of several deceptive practices targeted at homeowners, including bogus test kits, home inspection offers, ozone generators and chemical cleaners. The warnings point out that the presence of defective drywall cannot be determined by testing a home's air, or corrected by chemical sprays or ozone generators.[31]\\r\\nMore recently, news reports have pointed out \\"convicted scammers, thieves and uncertified workers who illegally pose as licensed contractors\\" and profit from homeowner confusion and panic. The Palm Beach Post found that of 47 remediation and inspection companies checked, 26 were created since January 2009, and only 18 of the 47 were run by licensed contractors. In Florida, lack of legal regulation allows anyone to \\"remediate\\" drywall problems, regardless of training or professional qualifications. The most recent job of one company's owner was operating an Asian Brides website.[32]\\r\\nClass action lawsuits claiming respiratory problems and headaches have been filed by Florida homeowners against home builders, drywall suppliers, and a Chinese drywall manufacturer.\\r\\nIn October 2010, U.S. District Judge Eldon E. Fallon in New Orleans endorsed a settlement in which Knauf Group will pay for the repair of 300 homes of the 3,000 involved in one particular case.[33] Several insurance companies are participating in the agreement. The homes are in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi, but no Texas and Virginia homes are affected by the agreement.[33]\\r\\nHome supply retailer Lowe's has denied claims that they have sold contaminated drywall imported from China. Numerous class action lawsuits were brought against the company, and as of October 28, 2010 Lowe's has agreed to a settlement that may award victims up to $100,000 for damages caused by contaminated drywall purchased at their stores. Lowe's released a statement saying,\\r\\nControversy has arisen over whether the damage will be covered under the insurance policies for home insurance or general liability insurance. In March 2010, a New Orleans judge ruled that the damage was covered under a home insurance policy.[35] It is unknown whether the general liability insurance will cover the claims. The standard policy contained an exception to an exclusion for pollution which allowed coverage if the pollution came from the products of the insured, but insurers had revised the policies to incorporate a \\"total pollution exclusion\\" which has no exception. Even without a total pollution exclusion, around 2005 insurers began inserting another provision to deny construction defect claims.[36] Whether or not insurance coverage will be granted generally depends on state law and a state court's interpretation, but in this case may be determined for multiple states under the Louisiana multiple district litigation (MDL) overseen by a federal court.[37]\\r\\nOn September 30, 2010, the Internal Revenue Service announced it would provide tax relief for homeowners affected by property damage caused by imported Chinese drywall. The IRS has categorized the copper corrosion from the sulfur gasses emitted by the imported drywall as \\"casualty loss\\", and is in a similar category to property damage after a catastrophic event, such as a hurricane. However, homeowners can only claim a deduction after repairing the affected area(s), and much controversy has arisen because of the great out-of-pocket expense to affected homeowners.[38][39]\\r\\nEarly reporting raised concerns about the presence of phosphogypsum, gypsum formed as a by-product of processing phosphate ore into fertilizer with sulfuric acid. Phosphogypsum is radioactive due to the presence of naturally occurring uranium and radium in the phosphate ore. The substance has been banned for use in U.S construction since 1989.[40] Tests of drywall samples by the EPA and the Florida Department of Health showed radioactivity at levels no higher than those ordinarily found in the natural environment.[41]","input":"When was chinese drywall used in the us?"},{"output":"in the mid-2010s","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAustin Richard Post (born July 4, 1995), known professionally as Post Malone, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer. \\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Syracuse, New York and raised in Grapevine, Texas, Malone rose to fame in the mid-2010s following the release of his debut single \\"White Iverson\\".

Post's father had been a disc jockey in his youth and introduced Post to many different genres of music including hip-hop, country, and rock.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Post was 9 years old,[8] he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas after his father became the manager of concessions for the Dallas Cowboys.[9][10] Post began to play the guitar and auditioned for the band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the popular video game Guitar Hero.[11] Post has always had a love for emo music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles in June 2017, playing My Chemical Romance at the event.[12] According to Post, his very first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band.[13] Soon after, he says he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip-hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.[14] At 16, using Audacity, Post created his first mixtape, Young and After Them Riches.[15] He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School.[11][16] He was voted \\"Most Likely to Become Famous\\" by his classmates as a senior in high school.

In November, Malone released the official music video for \\"Rockstar\\", directed by Emil Nava.[53][54][55][56]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 20, 2018, Malone previewed his new song with Ty Dolla Sign titled \\"Psycho.\\"[57] \\"Psycho\\" was released on February 23, 2018[58] and a tour with 21 Savage was announced.[59] The song debuted at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Post's third entry in the top 10.[60] On April 5, 2018, Malone stated that Beerbongs & Bentleys will be released on April 27, 2018.[61] The same day, he also premiered the song \\"Stay\\" during the Bud Lite Dive Bar show in Nashville.[62] Upon release, Beerbongs & Bentleys broke the first day streaming records on Spotify, with 78.7 million streams worldwide.[63] The album was also certified platinum by the RIAA after four days[64] and spawned three top 10 songs and six top 20 songs.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview with Billboard in May 2018, Malone's manager announced that Malone was planning to start his own record label and film production company[66] and Post later won Top Rap Song at the Billboard Music Awards for \\"Rockstar\\" featuring 21 Savage.[67] Post confirmed in June 2018 that he was writing his third album,[68] a collaboration album with Mac Miller was also teased in August 2018.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nPost's music has described as a \\"melting pot of the country, grunge, hip-hop and R&B\\"[70] and Post himself has been described as versatile.[71] His vocal style has been described as laconic.[72] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described Post as \\"an artist who toes the line between singing and rapping, and hip-hop and spooky electric folk\\".[73] Malone himself has called his music \\"genre-less\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nPost cites Bob Dylan, in whom he became interested around the age of 15, as an influence on his music, calling him \\"a genius\\" and \\"a god\\" though his music has been called \\"about as far away from Rock n' Roll as you can get.\\"[74] He called \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" the \\"first rap song\\". He has a tattoo of Dylan as well.[9] Post has also listed rappers 50 Cent, whom he called a legend[75] and Key! as influences.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nMalone has been described as the \\"Donald Trump of hip-hop\\" by executives at Republic Records, who state that \\"things that should've killed his career have only made him bigger.\\"[77] He has also been described as \\"a rich kid whose parents essentially paid his way into music.\\"[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nMalone has been called a \\"culture vulture\\" multiple times by different publications and on social media[78][79] for appropriating African-American culture.[80][81][82] California rapper Lil B wrote on Twitter in October 2017: \\"Post Malone is slowly turning into a white dude! Lol hes pushing, it give it a few years he gon be full country and hate blacks lol\\", with Post replying in an interview, claiming that his white skin has been \\"used against him.\\"[83] In January 2018, Post went on an intoxicated rant against people who describe him as a culture vulture.[84][85] In an interview with GQ several days later, Post said \\"theres a struggle being a white rapper.\\"[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a November 2017 interview with Polish media outlet NewOnce, Malone said that modern hip-hop music lacks \\"people talking about real shit\\" and added that \\"if you're looking to think about life, don't listen to hip-hop.\\"[76][87] He received social media backlash for his comments, including from fellow rappers such as Lil B and Vince Staples.[88][89] Malone later appeared in a video on Twitter, saying that the reason for his comments was that it was a \\"beer-tasting\\" interview,[90] and going on to say that he loves hip-hop.[91][92] NewOnce, however, denied that claim, stating that Malone barely drank at all during the interview.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nPost currently lives in Los Angeles, California.[94] He also has a $3 million 13,000-square-foot home in northern Utah.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nPost has a series of tattoos and has personally tattooed before[96], inspired by Justin Bieber. His first tattoo was of the Playboy Bunny. He has tattoos on his hand and fingers with artists that he was influenced by having their faces tattooed on each individual finger. Post has a rifle with a snake wrapped around it tattooed on his triceps in recognition of the 2nd Amendment[97] and the face of deceased rapper, Lil Peep on his arm.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of face tattoos, Post has barbed wire tattooed across his forehead and an upside-down music note tattooed under his eye,[99] the words \\"Stay Away\\" tattooed above his right eyebrow,[100] \\"always tired\\" under both of his eyes[101] and a dagger on the left side of his face.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nPost has a tattoo of U.S. president John F. Kennedy on his arm, and has said that Kennedy was \\"the only President to speak out against the crazy corruption stuff that's going on in our government nowadays.\\"[103] In December 2016, Post stated that if asked to perform at the inauguration of Donald Trump he would not have been opposed,[104] though he stated that neither Trump nor Hillary Clinton were fit for President of the United States and expressed his support of Bernie Sanders during the election cycle.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nPost later expressed a dislike for Trump in a November 2017 interview for Rolling Stone. In the same interview, he revealed that he owned a myriad of guns, and believed it was an \\"American\\" right to own and operate guns. He also expressed a heavy interest in conspiracy theories, saying \\"There's crazy shit that goes on that we can't explain.\\"[11] During a trip to Canada, Post was interviewed and when asked what the \\"biggest lie is\\", he replied The biggest lie in the world is the U.S. government, Its a fucking reality show and I think theres gonna be a lot of weird shit that happens within our generation that really changes the way of the world.[105]","input":"When did post malone start his music career?"},{"output":"1400 CE","context":"The Navajo (/n?v.?.ho?/; British English: Navaho, Navajo: Din or Naabeeh܇) are a Native American people of the Southwestern United States. The Navajo people are politically divided between two federally recognized tribes, the Navajo Nation and the Colorado River Indian Tribes.\\r\\nAt more than 300,000 enrolled tribal members as of 2015[update][1][2], the Navajo Nation is the second largest federally recognized tribe in the U.S. (the Cherokee Nation being the largest), and has the largest reservation in the country. The reservation straddles the Four Corners region and covers more than 27,000 square miles of land in Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico. The Navajo language is spoken throughout the region, with most Navajos speaking English, as well.\\r\\nThe states with the largest Navajo populations are Arizona (140,263) and New Mexico (108,306). Over three-quarters of the Navajo population reside in these two states.[3] Thousands of Navajos also live in California.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Navajos are speakers of a Na-Den Southern Athabaskan language known within the language as Din bizaad (lit. 'People's language'). The language comprises two geographic, mutually intelligible dialects. It is closely related to the Apache language; the Navajos and Apaches are believed to have migrated from northwestern Canada and eastern Alaska, where the majority of Athabaskan speakers reside.[4] Speakers of various other Athabaskan languages located in Canada may still comprehend the Navajo language despite the geographic and linguistic deviation of the languages.[5] Additionally, some Navajos speak Navajo Sign Language, which is either a dialect or daughter of Plains Sign Talk, as well as some being speakers of Plains Sign Talk itself.[6]\\r\\nArchaeological and historical evidence suggests the Athabaskan ancestors of the Navajos and Apaches entered the Southwest around 1400 CE.[7][8] The Navajo oral tradition is said to retain references of this migration.[citation needed]\\r\\nUntil contact with Pueblos and the Spanish, the Navajos were largely hunters and gatherers. The tribe adopted crop-farming techniques from the Pueblo peoples, growing mainly corn, beans, and squash. When the Spanish arrived, the Navajos began herding sheep and goats as a main source of trade and food, with meat becoming an essential component of the Navajo diet. Sheep also became a form of currency and status symbols among the Navajos based on the overall quantity of herds a family maintained.[9][10] In addition, the practice of spinning and weaving wool into blankets and clothing became common and eventually developed into a form of highly valued artistic expression.\\r\\nOral history also indicates a long relationship with Pueblo people[11] and a willingness to adapt Puebloan ideas and linguistic variance into their culture, as well as long-established trading practices between the groups. Spanish records from the mid-16th century speak of the Pueblos exchanging maize and woven cotton goods for bison meat, hides, and stone from Athabaskans traveling to the pueblos or living in the vicinity of them. In the 18th century, the Spanish reported the Navajos' maintaining large herds of livestock and cultivating large crop areas.[citation needed]\\r\\nWestern historians believe that the Spanish before 1600 referred to the Navajo as Apaches (from the Zuni word for enemy) or Quechos. [12]:2ÿ4 Fray Geronimo de Zarate-Salmeron, who was in Jemez in 1622, used Apachu de Nabajo in the 1620s to refer to the people in the Chama Valley region, east of the San Juan River and northwest of present-day Santa Fe, New Mexico. \\"Navahu\\" comes from the Tewa, meaning large area of cultivated lands.[12]:7ÿ8 By the 1640s, the Spanish began using the term \\"Navajo\\" to refer to the Din. During the 1670s, the Spanish wrote that the Din lived in a region known as Dintah, about 60 miles (100?km) west of the Rio Chama valley region. In the 1770s, the Spanish sent military expeditions against the Navajos in the Mount Taylor and Chuska Mountain regions of New Mexico.[12]:43ÿ50 The Spanish, Navajo and Hopi continued to trade with each other and formed a loose alliance to fight Apache and Commanche bands for the next 20 years. During this time there were relatively minor raids by Navajo bands and Spanish citizens against each other.\\r\\nIn 1800 Governor Chacon led 500 men in an expedition to Tunicha Mountains against the Navajos. 20 Navajo Chiefs asked for peace. In 1804 and 1805 there were major expeditions by Navajos and Spanish against each other's settlements. In May 1805 another peace was established. Similar patterns of peace making, raiding and trading between Navajo, Spanish, Apaches, Comanches and Hopi continued until the arrival of the Americans in 1846.[12]\\r\\nThe Navajos came into contact with the United States Army in 1846, when General Stephen W. Kearny invaded Santa Fe with 1,600 men during the MexicanÿAmerican War. On November 21, 1846, following an invitation from a small party of American soldiers under the command of Captain John Reid, who journeyed deep into Navajo country and contacted him, Narbona and other Navajos negotiated a treaty of peace with Colonel Alexander Doniphan at Bear Springs, Ojo del Oso (later the site of Fort Wingate). This agreement was not honored by some Navajo and also by some New Mexicans. Navajos stole New Mexican livestock and New Mexicans took women, children and livestock from the Navajo.[13]\\r\\nIn 1849, the military governor of New Mexico, Colonel John MacRae Washingtonaccompanied by John S. Calhoun, an Indian agentled a force of 400 soldiers into Navajo country, penetrating Canyon de Chelly, and signed a treaty with two Navajo leaders Mariano Martinez as Head Chief and Chapitone as Second Chief. The treaty acknowledged the transfer of jurisdiction from the United Mexican States to the United States. The treaty allowed forts and trading posts to be built on Navajo land. The United States, on its part, promised \\"such donations [and] such other liberal and humane measures, as [it] may deem meet and proper.\\"[14] While en route to this treaty signing, Narbona, a prominent Navajo peace leader, was killed, resulting in hostility between the treaty parties.[15]\\r\\nDuring the next 10 years, the U.S. established forts on traditional Navajo territory. Military records cite this development as a precautionary measure to protect citizens and the Navajos from each other. However, Spanish/Mexican-Navajo pattern of raids and expeditions continued. Over 400 New Mexican militia conducted a campaign against the Navajo, against the wishes of the Territorial Governor, in 1860-61. They killed Navajos, captured women and children for slaves and destroyed crops and dwellings. The Navajo call this period Naahondzood, \\"the fearing time.\\"\\r\\nIn 1861, Brigadier-General James H. Carleton, Commander of the Federal District of New Mexico, initiated a series of military actions against the Navajos and Apaches. Colonel Kit Carson was at the new Fort Wingate with Army troops and volunteer New Mexico militia. Carleton ordered Carson to kill Mescalero Apache men and destroy any Mewscalero property he could find. Carleton believed these harsh tactics would bring any Indian Tribe under control The Mescalero surrendered and were sent to the new reservation called Bosque Redondo. In the summer of 1863, Carleton ordered Carson to use the same tactics on the Navajo. Carson and his force swept through Navajo land, killing Navajos and destroying crops and dwellings, fouling wells, and capturing livestock. Facing starvation and death, Navajo groups came to Fort Defiance. On July 20, 1863, the first of many groups started off to join the Mescalero at Bosque Redondo. Other groups continue to come in though 1864.[16]\\r\\nHowever, not all Navajos came in or were found. Some lived near the San Juan River, some beyond the Hopi villages and others lived with Apache bands.[17]\\r\\nBeginning in the spring of 1864, around 9,000 Navajo men, women, and children were forced to walk over 300 miles (480?km) to Fort Sumner, New Mexico, for internment at Bosque Redondo. The internment at Bosque Redondo was disastrous for the Navajo as the government failed to provide an adequate supply of water, wood, provisions, and livestock for 4,000ÿ5,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as well as raids by other tribes and civilians. In addition, a small group of Mescalero Apaches, longtime enemies of the Navajos, had been relocated to the area, resulting in conflicts. In 1868, a treaty was negotiated between Navajo leaders and the federal government allowing the surviving Navajos to return to a reservation on a portion of their former homeland. The Navajos were not provided with much protection, and many Navajo women and children were kidnapped and enslaved by enemies of the Navajo. While at Bosque Redondo, the government did not provide the Navajos with food or shelter, and some Navajos froze during the winter because of poor shelters that they had to make with few materials and resources. This period is known among the Navajo as \\"The Fearing Time\\"[18].\\r\\nThe United States military continued to maintain forts on the Navajo reservation in the years following the Long Walk. Between 1873 and 1895, the military employed Navajos as Indian Scouts at Fort Wingate to assist their regular units.[19] During this period, Chief Manuelito founded the Navajo Tribal Police, which operated between 1872 and 1875 as an anti-raid task force working to maintain the peaceful terms of the 1868 Navajo treaty.\\r\\nBy treaty, the Navajos were allowed to leave the reservation for trade with permission from the military or local Indian agent. Eventually, the arrangement led to a gradual end in Navajo raids as the tribe was able to increase the size of livestock and crops. In addition, the tribe was able to increase the size of the Navajo reservation from 3.5 million acres (14,000?km2 (5,400?sq?mi)) to the 16 million acres (65,000?km2 (25,000?sq?mi)) as it stands today; however, economic conflicts with non-Navajos continued for many years as civilians and companies exploited resources assigned to the Navajos. The US government made leases for livestock grazing, took land for railroad development, and permitted mining on Navajo land without consultation with the tribe.\\r\\nIn 1883, Lt. Parker, accompanied by 10 enlisted men and two scouts, went up the San Juan River to separate Navajos and citizens who had encroached on Navajo land.[20] In the same year, Lt. Lockett, with the aid of 42 enlisted soldiers, was joined by Lt. Holomon at Navajo Springs. Evidently, citizens of the surnames Houck and/or Owens had murdered a Navajo chief's son, and 100 armed Navajos were looking for them.\\r\\nIn 1887, citizens Palmer, Lockhart, and King fabricated a charge of horse stealing and randomly attacked a home on the reservation. Two Navajo men and all three whites died, but a woman and a child survived. Capt. Kerr (with two Navajo scouts) examined the ground and then met with several hundred Navajos at Houcks Tank. Rancher Bennett, whose horse was allegedly stolen, pointed out to Kerr that his horses were stolen by the three whites to catch a horse thief.[21] In the same year, Lt. Scott went to the San Juan River with two scouts and 21 enlisted men. The Navajos believed Lt. Scott was there to drive off the whites who had settled on the reservation and had fenced off the river from the Navajos. Scott found evidence of many non-Navajo ranches. Only three were active, and the owners wanted payment for their improvements before leaving. Scott ejected them.[22]\\r\\nIn 1890, a local rancher refused to pay the Navajos a fine of livestock. The Navajos tried to collect it, and whites in southern Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 of the Navajos were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1913, an Indian agent ordered a Navajo and his three wives to come in, and then arrested them for having a plural marriage. A small group of Navajos used force to free the women and retreated to Beautiful Mountain with 30 or 40 sympathizers. They refused to surrender to the agent, and local law enforcement and military refused the agent's request for an armed engagement. General Scott arrived, and with the help of Henry Chee Dodge, defused the situation.\\r\\nDuring the time on the reservation, the Navajo tribe was forced to acclimatise to white society. Navajo children were sent to boarding schools within the reservation and off the reservation. The first Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) school opened at Fort Defiance in 1870[23] and led the way for eight others to be established.[24] Many older Navajos were against this education and would hide their children to keep them from being taken. Many children, on the other hand, wanted to attend these schools and would go willingly with the Silo.\\r\\nOnce the children arrived at the boarding school, their lifestyles changed dramatically. European Americans taught the classes under an English-only curriculum and punished any student caught speaking Navajo.[24] The children were under militaristic discipline, run by the Silo. Through multiple interviews, the interviewees recalled being captured and disciplined by the Silo if they tried to run away. Other conditions included inadequate food, overcrowding, manual labor in kitchens, fields, and boiler rooms, and military-style uniforms and haircuts.[25]\\r\\nChange did not occur in these boarding schools until the Meriam Report was published in 1929 by the Secretary of Interior, Hubert Work. This report discussed Indian boarding schools as being inadequate in terms of diet, medical services, dormitory overcrowding, undereducated teachers, restrictive discipline, and manual labor by the students to keep the school running.[26] This report was the precursor to education reforms initiated under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, under which two new schools were built on the Navajo reservation. Rough Rock Day School was run in the same militaristic style as Fort Defiance and did not implement the educational reforms. The Evangelical Missionary School was opened next to Rough Rock Day School. Navajo accounts of this school portray it as a family-like atmosphere with home-cooked meals, new or gently used clothing, humane treatment, and a Navajo-based curriculum. Educators found the Evangelical Missionary School curriculum to be much more beneficial to the Navajo children.[27]\\r\\nIn 1937, Mary Cabot Wheelright and Hastiin Klah, an esteemed and influential Navajo singer, or medicine man, founded the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in Santa Fe. It is a repository for sound recordings, manuscripts, paintings, and sandpainting tapestries of the Navajos. It also featured exhibits to express the beauty, dignity, and logic of Navajo religion. When Klah met Cabot in 1921, he had witnessed decades of efforts by the US government and missionaries to assimilate the Navajos into mainstream society. Children were sent away to Indian boarding schools, where they were forced to learn English and practice Christianity. They were prohibited from using their own languages and religion. The museum was founded to preserve the religion and traditions of the Navajos, which Klah was sure would soon be lost forever.\\r\\nThe Navajo Livestock Reduction was imposed upon the Navajo Nation by the federal government starting in the 1933.[28] Under various forms it continued into the 1950s, The government decided that the land of the Navajo Nation could only support a fixed number of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. The Federal government believed the land erosion was worsening and the only solution was to reduce the livestock. In 1933, John Collier was appointed commissioner of the BIA.\\r\\nThe capacity was set in \\"sheep units\\". The Navajo grazed 1,100,000 mature sheep units in 1930.[29] These sheep provided half the cash income for the individual Navajo.[30] Collier's solution was to first launch a voluntary program which soon became mandatory in 1935. These programs may have paid for part of the value of each animal, but it did nothing to address the loss of future yearly income. In the matrilineal and matrilocal world of the Navajo, women were especially hurt, as many lost their only source of income.[31]\\r\\nThe Navajo did not understand why their centuries-old practices of raising livestock should change.[29] They were united in opposition but they were unable to stop it.[32] Historian Brian Dippie notes that the Indian Rights Association denounced Collier as a 'dictator' and accused him of a \\"near reign of terror\\" on the Navajo reservation. Dippie adds that, \\"He became an object of 'burning hatred' among the very people whose problems so preoccupied him.\\"[33] The long-term result was strong Navajo opposition to Collier's Indian New Deal.[34]\\r\\nMany Navajo young people moved to work in urban factories in World War II. Many Navajo men volunteered for military service in keeping with their warrior culture, where they served in integrated units. The War Department in 1940 rejected a proposal by the BIA that segregated units be created for the Indians. They gained firsthand experience with how they could assimilate into the modern world and many did not return to the overcrowded reservation with few jobs.[35]\\r\\nFour hundred Navajo Code Talkers played a famous role during World War II by relaying radio messages using their own language, which the Japanese were unable to understand.[36]\\r\\nIn the 1940s, large quantities of uranium were discovered in Navajo land. From then into the early 21st century, the U.S. allowed mining without sufficient environmental protection for workers, waterways, and land. The Navajos have claimed high rates of death and illness from lung disease and cancer resulting from environmental contamination. Since the 1970s, legislation has helped to regulate the industry and reduce the toll, but the government has not yet offered holistic and comprehensive compensation.[37]\\r\\nThe name Navajo comes from the late 18th century via the Spanish (Apaches de) Navaj܇ \\"(Apaches of) Navaj܇\\", which was derived from the Tewa navah \\"fields adjoining a ravine\\". The Navajos call themselves Din.[38]\\r\\nLike other Apacheans, the Navajos were semi-nomadic from the 16th through the 20th centuries. Their extended kinship groups had seasonal dwelling areas to accommodate livestock, agriculture, and gathering practices. As part of their traditional economy, Navajo groups may have formed trading or raiding parties, traveling relatively long distances.\\r\\nThere is a system of clans which defines relationships between individuals and families. The clan system is exogamous: people can only marry (and date) partners outside their own clans, which for this purpose include the clans of their four grandparents. While clans are associated with a geographical area, the area is not for the exclusive use of any one clan. Members of a clan may live hundreds of miles apart but still have a clan bond.[17]:xix-xxi\\r\\nHistorically, the structure of the Navajo society is largely a matrilineal system, in which the family of the women owned livestock, dwellings, planting areas and livestock grazing areas. Once married, a Navajo man would move to live with his bride in her dwelling and near her mother's family. Daughters (or, if necessary, other female relatives) were traditionally the ones who received the generational property inheritance. Children are \\"born to\\" and belong to the mother's clan, and are \\"born for\\" the father's clan. The mother's eldest brother has a strong role in her children's lives. As adults, men represent their mother's clan in tribal politics.[38]\\r\\nSee Navajo ethnobotany.\\r\\nA hogan, the traditional Navajo home, is built as a shelter for either a man or for a woman. Since they live in the arid Four Corners area, the houses are made of dried mud. Male hogans are square or conical with a distinct rectangular entrance, while a female hogan[citation needed] is an eight-sided house. Both are made of wood and covered in mud, with the door always facing east to welcome the sun each morning. The Navajos construct hogans out of poles and brush covered with earth.[39] Navajos also have several types of hogans for lodging and ceremonial use. Ceremonies, such as healing ceremonies or the kinaald, take place inside a hogan.[40] According to Kehoe, this style of housing is distinctive to the Navajos. She writes, \\"even today, a solidly constructed, log-walled Hogan is preferred by many Navajo families.\\" Most Navajo members today live in apartments and houses in urban areas.[41]\\r\\nThose who practice the Navajo religion regard the hogan as sacred. The religious song \\"The Blessingway\\" (h܇zh????j) describes the first hogan as being built by Coyote with help from Beavers to be a house for First Man, First Woman, and Talking God. The Beaver People gave Coyote logs and instructions on how to build the first hogan. Navajos made their hogans in the traditional fashion until the 1900s, when they started to make them in hexagonal and octagonal shapes. Hogans continue to be used as dwellings, especially by older Navajos, although they tend to be made with modern construction materials and techniques. Some are maintained specifically for ceremonial purposes.\\r\\nNavajo spiritual practice is about restoring balance and harmony to a person's life to produce health and is based on the ideas of H܇zh܇܇j. The Din believed in two classes of people: Earth People and Holy People. The Navajo people believe they passed through three worlds before arriving in this world, the Fourth World or the Glittering World. As Earth People, the Din must do everything within their power to maintain the balance between Mother Earth and man.[42] The Din also had the expectation of keeping a positive relationship between them and the Diyin Din. In the Din Bahane' (Navajo beliefs about creation), the First, or Dark World is where the four Diyin Din lived and where First Woman and First Man came into existence. Because the world was so dark, life could not thrive there and they had to move on. The Second, or Blue World, was inhabited by a few of the mammals Earth People know today as well as the Swallow Chief, or Tshch܇zhii. The First World beings had offended him and were asked to leave. From there, they headed south and arrived in the Third World, or Yellow World. The four sacred mountains were found here, but due to a great flood, First Woman, First Man, and the Holy People were forced to find another world to live in. This time, when they arrived, they stayed in the Fourth World. In the Glittering World, true death came into existence, as well as the creations of the seasons, the moon, stars, and the sun.[43]\\r\\nThe Holy People, or Diyin Din, had instructed the Earth People to view the four sacred mountains as the boundaries of the homeland (Dintah) they should never leave: Blanca Peak (Sisnaajin  Dawn or White Shell Mountain) in Colorado; Mount Taylor (Tsoodzi?  Blue Bead or Turquoise Mountain) in New Mexico; the San Francisco Peaks (Dook?o?oos?d  Abalone Shell Mountain) in Arizona; and Hesperus Mountain (Dib Nitsaa  Big Mountain Sheep) in Colorado.[44] Times of day, as well as colors, are used to represent the four sacred mountains. Throughout religions, the importance of a specific number is emphasized and in the Navajo religion, the number four appears to be sacred to their practices. For example, there were four original clans of Din, four colors and times of day, four Diyin Din, and for the most part, four songs sung for a ritual.[44]\\r\\nNavajo have many different ceremonies. For the most part, their ceremonies are to prevent or cure diseases.[45] Corn pollen is used as a blessing and as an offering during prayer.[42] One half of major Navajo song ceremonial complex is the Blessing Way (H܇zh????j) and other half is the Enemy Way (Ana? Nd?). The Blessing Way ceremonies are based on establishing \\"peace, harmony, and good things exclusively\\" within the Dine. The Enemy Way, or Evil Way ceremonies are concerned with counteracting influences that come from outside the Dine.[45] Spiritual healing ceremonies are rooted in Navajo traditional stories. One of them, the Night Chant ceremony, is conducted over several days and involves up to 24 dancers. The ceremony requires the dancers to wear buckskin masks, as do many of the other Navajo ceremonies, and they all represent specific gods.[45] The purpose of the Night Chant is to purify the patients and heal them through prayers to the spirit-beings. Each day of the ceremony entails the performance of certain rites and the creation of detailed sand paintings. One of the songs describes the home of the thunderbirds:\\r\\nThe ceremonial leader proceeds by asking the Holy People to be present in the beginning of the ceremony, then identifying the patient with the power of the spirit-being, and describing the patient's transformation to renewed health with lines such as, \\"Happily I recover.\\"[47]\\r\\nCeremonies are used to correct curses that cause of some illnesses or misfortunes. People may complain of witches who do harm to the minds, bodies, and families of innocent people.,[48] though these matters are rarely discussed in detail with those outside of the community.[49]\\r\\nSilversmithing is an important art form among Navajos. Atsidi Sani (c. 1830ÿc. 1918) is considered to be the first Navajo silversmith. He learned silversmithing from a Mexican man called Nakai Tsosi (\\"Thin Mexican\\") around 1878 and began teaching other Navajos how to work with silver.[50] By 1880, Navajo silversmiths were creating handmade jewelry including bracelets, tobacco flasks, necklaces and bracers. Later, they added silver earrings, buckles, bolos, hair ornaments, pins and squash blossom necklaces for tribal use, and to sell to tourists as a way to supplement their income.[51]\\r\\nThe Navajos' hallmark jewelry piece called the \\"squash blossom\\" necklace first appeared in the 1880s. The term \\"squash blossom\\" was apparently attached to the name of the Navajo necklace at an early date, although its bud-shaped beads are thought to derive from Spanish-Mexican pomegranate designs.[52] The Navajo silversmiths also borrowed the \\"naja\\" (najahe in Navajo)[53] symbol to shape the silver pendant that hangs from the \\"squash blossom\\" necklace.\\r\\nTurquoise has been part of jewelry for centuries, but Navajo artists did not use inlay techniques to insert turquoise into silver designs until the late 19th century.\\r\\nNavajos came to the southwest with their own weaving traditions; however, they learned to weave cotton on upright looms from Pueblo peoples. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. By the 18th century the Navajos had begun to import Bayeta red yarn to supplement local black, grey, and white wool, as well as wool dyed with indigo. Using an upright loom, the Navajos made extremely fine utilitarian blankets that were collected by Ute and Plains Indians. These Chief's Blankets, so called because only chiefs or very wealthy individuals could afford them, were characterized by horizontal stripes and minimal patterning in red. First Phase Chief's Blankets have only horizontal stripes, Second Phase feature red rectangular designs, and Third Phase feature red diamonds and partial diamond patterns.\\r\\nThe completion of the railroads dramatically changed Navajo weaving. Cheap blankets were imported, so Navajo weavers shifted their focus to weaving rugs for an increasingly non-Native audience. Rail service also brought in Germantown wool from Philadelphia, commercially dyed wool which greatly expanded the weavers' color palettes.\\r\\nSome early European-American settlers moved in and set up trading posts, often buying Navajo rugs by the pound and selling them back east by the bale. The traders encouraged the locals to weave blankets and rugs into distinct styles. These included \\"Two Gray Hills\\" (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns); Teec Nos Pos (colorful, with very extensive patterns); \\"Ganado\\" (founded by Don Lorenzo Hubbell[54]), red-dominated patterns with black and white; \\"Crystal\\" (founded by J. B. Moore); oriental and Persian styles (almost always with natural dyes); \\"Wide Ruins\\", \\"Chinlee\\", banded geometric patterns; \\"Klagetoh\\", diamond-type patterns; \\"Red Mesa\\" and bold diamond patterns.[55] Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought to embody traditional ideas about harmony or h܇zh??.\\r\\nIn 2000 the documentary The Return of Navajo Boy was shown at the Sundance Film Festival. It was written in response to an earlier film, The Navajo Boy which was somewhat exploitative of those Navajos involved. The Return of Navajo Boy allowed the Navajo to be more involved in the depictions of themselves.[56]\\r\\nIn the final episode of the third season of the FX reality TV show 30 Days, the show's producer Morgan Spurlock spends thirty days living with a Navajo family on their reservation in New Mexico. The July 2008 show called \\"Life on an Indian Reservation\\", depicts the dire conditions that many Native Americans experience living on reservations in the United States.\\r\\nTony Hillerman wrote a series of detective novels whose detective characters were members of the Navajo Tribal Police. The novels are noted for incorporating details about Navajo culture, and in some cases expand focus to include nearby Hopi and Zuni characters and cultures, as well. Four of the novels have been adapted for film/TV. His daughter has continued the novel series after his death.\\r\\nCoordinates: 361113N 1093425W? / ?36.1869N 109.5736W? / 36.1869; -109.5736","input":"When did the navajo arrive in the southwest?"},{"output":"the auditory system","context":"Hair cells are the sensory receptors of both the auditory system and the vestibular system in the ears of all vertebrates. Through mechanotransduction, hair cells detect movement in their environment.[1] In mammals, the auditory hair cells are located within the spiral organ of Corti on the thin basilar membrane in the cochlea of the inner ear. They derive their name from the tufts of stereocilia called hair bundles that protrude from the apical surface of the cell into the fluid-filled cochlear duct. Mammalian cochlear hair cells are of two anatomically and functionally distinct types, known as outer, and inner hair cells. Damage to these hair cells results in decreased hearing sensitivity, and because the inner ear hair cells cannot regenerate, this damage is permanent.[2] However, other organisms, such as the frequently studied zebrafish, and birds have hair cells that can regenerate.[3][4] The human cochlea contains on the order of 3,500 inner hair cells and 12,000 outer hair cells at birth.[5]\\r\\nThe outer hair cells mechanically amplify low-level sound that enters the cochlea. The amplification may be powered by the movement of their hair bundles, or by an electrically driven motility of their cell bodies. This so-called somatic electromotility amplifies sound in all land vertebrates. It is affected by the closing mechanism of the mechanical sensory ion channels at the tips of the hair bundles.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe inner hair cells transform the sound vibrations in the fluids of the cochlea into electrical signals that are then relayed via the auditory nerve to the auditory brainstem and to the auditory cortex.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deflection of the hair-cell stereocilia opens mechanically gated ion channels that allow any small, positively charged ions (primarily potassium and calcium) to enter the cell.[6] Unlike many other electrically active cells, the hair cell itself does not fire an action potential. Instead, the influx of positive ions from the endolymph in the scala media depolarizes the cell, resulting in a receptor potential. This receptor potential opens voltage gated calcium channels; calcium ions then enter the cell and trigger the release of neurotransmitters at the basal end of the cell. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the narrow space between the hair cell and a nerve terminal, where they then bind to receptors and thus trigger action potentials in the nerve. In this way, the mechanical sound signal is converted into an electrical nerve signal. Repolarization of hair cells is done in a special manner. The perilymph in the scala tympani has a very low concentration of positive ions. The electrochemical gradient makes the positive ions flow through channels to the perilymph.\\r\\nHair cells chronically leak Ca2+. This leakage causes a tonic release of neurotransmitter to the synapses. It is thought that this tonic release is what allows the hair cells to respond so quickly in response to mechanical stimuli. The quickness of the hair cell response may also be due to the fact that it can increase the amount of neurotransmitter release in response to a change as little as 100?V in membrane potential.[7]\\r\\nIn mammalian outer hair cells, the receptor potential triggers active vibrations of the cell body. This mechanical response to electrical signals is termed somatic electromotility[8] and drives oscillations in the cells length, which occur at the frequency of the incoming sound and provide mechanical feedback amplification.[9] Outer hair cells are found only in mammals. While hearing sensitivity of mammals is similar to that of other classes of vertebrates, without functioning outer hair cells, the sensitivity decreases by approximately 50?dB[citation needed]. Outer hair cells extend the hearing range to about 200?kHz in some marine mammals.[10] They have also improved frequency selectivity (frequency discrimination), which is of particular benefit for humans, because it enabled sophisticated speech and music.\\r\\nThe effect of this system is to non-linearly amplify quiet sounds more than large ones so that a wide range of sound pressures can be reduced to a much smaller range of hair displacements.[11] This property of amplification is called the cochlear amplifier.\\r\\nThe molecular biology of hair cells has seen considerable progress in recent years, with the identification of the motor protein (prestin) that underlies somatic electromotility in the outer hair cells. Prestin's function has been shown to be dependent on chloride channel signaling and that it is compromised by the common marine pesticide tributyltin. Because this class of pollutant bioconcentrates up the food chain, the effect is pronounced in top marine predators such as orcas and toothed whales.[12]\\r\\nCalcium ion influx plays an important role for the hair cells to adapt to the amplification of the signal. This allows humans to ignore constant sounds that are no longer new and allow us to be acute to other changes in our surrounding. The key adaptation mechanism comes from a motor protein myosin-1c that allows slow adaptation, provides tension to sensitize transduction channels, and also participate in signal transduction apparatus.[13][14] More recent research now shows that the calcium-sensitive binding of calmodulin to myosin-1c could actually modulate the interaction of the adaptation motor with other components of the transduction apparatus as well.[15]\\r\\nFast Adaptation: During fast adaptation, Ca2+ions that enter a stereocilium through an open MET channel bind rapidly to a site on or near the channel and induce channel closure. When channels close, tension increases in the tip link, pulling the bundle in the opposite direction.[13] Fast adaptation is more prominent in sound and auditory detecting hair cells, rather in vestibular cells.\\r\\nSlow Adaption: The dominating model suggests that slow adaptation occurs when myosin-1c slides down the stereocilium in response to elevated tension during bundle displacement.[13] The resultant decreased tension in the tip link permits the bundle to move farther in the opposite direction. As tension decreases, channels close, producing the decline in transduction current.[13] Slow adaptation is most prominent in vestibular hair cells that sense spatial movement and less in cochlear hair cells that detect auditory signals.[14]\\r\\nNeurons of the auditory or vestibulocochlear nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) innervate cochlear and vestibular hair cells.[16] The neurotransmitter released by hair cells that stimulates the terminal neurites of peripheral axons of the afferent (towards the brain) neurons is thought to be glutamate. At the presynaptic juncture, there is a distinct presynaptic dense body or ribbon. This dense body is surrounded by synaptic vesicles and is thought to aid in the fast release of neurotransmitter.\\r\\nNerve fiber innervation is much denser for inner hair cells than for outer hair cells. A single inner hair cell is innervated by numerous nerve fibers, whereas a single nerve fiber innervates many outer hair cells. Inner hair cell nerve fibers are also very heavily myelinated, which is in contrast to the unmyelinated outer hair cell nerve fibers. The region of the basilar membrane supplying the inputs to a particular afferent nerve fibre can be considered to be its receptive field.\\r\\nEfferent projections from the brain to the cochlea also play a role in the perception of sound. Efferent synapses occur on outer hair cells and on afferent axons under inner hair cells. The presynaptic terminal bouton is filled with vesicles containing acetylcholine and a neuropeptide called calcitonin gene-related peptide. The effects of these compounds vary, in some hair cells the acetylcholine hyperpolarized the cell, which reduces the sensitivity of the cochlea locally.\\r\\nResearch on the regrowth of cochlear cells may lead to medical treatments that restore hearing. Unlike birds and fish, humans and other mammals are generally incapable of regrowing the cells of the inner ear that convert sound into neural signals when those cells are damaged by age or disease.[4][17] Researchers are making progress in gene therapy and stem-cell therapy that may allow the damaged cells to be regenerated. Because hair cells of auditory and vestibular systems in birds and fish have been found to regenerate, their ability has been studied at length.[4][18] In addition, lateral line hair cells, which have a mechanotransduction function, have been shown to regrow in organisms, such as the zebrafish.[19]\\r\\nResearchers have identified a mammalian gene that normally acts as a molecular switch to block the regrowth of cochlear hair cells in adults.[20] The Rb1 gene encodes the retinoblastoma protein, which is a tumor suppressor. Rb stops cells from dividing by encouraging their exit from the cell cycle.[21][22] Not only do hair cells in a culture dish regenerate when the Rb1 gene is deleted, but mice bred to be missing the gene grow more hair cells than control mice that have the gene. Additionally, the sonic hedgehog protein has been shown to block activity of the retinoblastoma protein, thereby inducing cell cycle re-entry and the regrowth of new cells.[23]\\r\\nThe cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 (CDKN1B) has also been found to encourage regrowth of cochlear hair cells in mice following genetic deletion or knock down with siRNA targeting p27.[24][25] Research on hair cell regeneration may bring us closer to clinical treatment for human hearing loss caused by hair cell damage or death.\\r\\nThe lamina reticularis and subjacent structures.\\r\\nInner ear illustration showing semicircular canal, hair cells, ampulla, cupula, vestibular nerve, & fluid\\r\\nStereocilia of frog inner ear","input":"What type of receptors are in the ear?"},{"output":"Melbourne","context":"The ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the \\"flagship event of the international cricket calendar\\" by the ICC.[1]\\r\\nThe first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.\\r\\nThe World Cup is open to all members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), although the highest-ranking teams receive automatic qualification. The remaining teams are determined via the World Cricket League and the ICC World Cup Qualifier. A total of twenty teams have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen competing in the latest edition in 2015; the next edition in 2019 will have only ten teams. Australia has won the tournament five times, with the West Indies, India (twice each), Pakistan and Sri Lanka (once each) also having won the tournament. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament. The tournament is the worlds 4th biggest sporting event behind the FIFA World Cup, Summer Olympics and the Rugby World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first international cricket match was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844.[2] However, the first credited Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England, and the two teams competed regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years. South Africa was admitted to Test status in 1889.[3] Representative cricket teams were selected to tour each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games, where Great Britain defeated France to win the gold medal.[4] This was the only appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics.\\r\\nThe first multilateral competition at international level was the 1912 Triangular Tournament, a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa. The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and attendances were poor, attributed to a \\"surfeit of cricket\\".[5] Since then, international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series: a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular Asian Test Championship in 1999.[6]\\r\\nThe number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time, with the addition of West Indies in 1928, New Zealand in 1930, India in 1932, and Pakistan in 1952. However, international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in 1962 with a four-team knockout competition known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup,[7] and continuing with the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963, one-day cricket grew in popularity in England. A national Sunday League was formed in 1969. The first One-Day International match was played on the fifth day of a rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in 1971, to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty over game with eight balls per over.[8]\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. It introduced many of the now commonplace features of One Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England and other parts of the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.[9]\\r\\nThe inaugural Cricket World Cup was hosted in 1975 by England, the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at the time. The 1975 tournament started on 7 June.[10] The first three events were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors Prudential plc. The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per team, played during the daytime in traditional form, with the players wearing cricket whites and using red cricket balls.[11]\\r\\nEight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the West Indies (the six Test nations at the time), together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa.[12] One notable omission was South Africa, who were banned from international cricket due to apartheid. The tournament was won by the West Indies, who defeated Australia by 17 runs in the final at Lord's.[12]\\r\\nThe 1979 World Cup saw the introduction of the ICC Trophy competition to select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup,[13] with Sri Lanka and Canada qualifying.[14] The West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament, defeating the hosts England by 92 runs in the final. At a meeting which followed the World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial event.[14]\\r\\nThe 1983 event was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this stage, Sri Lanka had become a Test-playing nation, and Zimbabwe qualified through the ICC Trophy. A fielding circle was introduced, 30 yards (27?m) away from the stumps. Four fieldsmen needed to be inside it at all times.[15] The teams faced each other twice, before moving into the knock-outs. India, an outsider, quoted at 66ÿ1 to win by bookmakers before the competition began, were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.[9][16]\\r\\nIndia and Pakistan jointly hosted the 1987 tournament, the first time that the competition was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent compared with England's summer.[17] Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final, the closest margin in World Cup final history.[18][19]\\r\\nThe 1992 World Cup, held in Australia and New Zealand, introduced many changes to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, day/night matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules. The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time, following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the international sports boycott.[20] Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs in the final and emerge as winners.[21]\\r\\nThe 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage matches.[22] In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory over India at Eden Gardens after the hosts lost eight wickets while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252, were awarded victory by default after crowd unrest broke out in protest against the Indian performance.[23] Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final at Lahore.[24]\\r\\nIn 1999 the event was hosted by England, with some matches also being held in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands.[25][26] Twelve teams contested the World Cup. Australia qualified for the semi-finals after reaching their target in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match.[27] They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi-final also against South Africa where a mix-up between South African batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid-pitch to be run out. In the final, Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in hand.[28]\\r\\nSouth Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the 2003 World Cup. The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. Kenya's victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others?ÿ and a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns?ÿ enabled Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an associate.[29] In the final, Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.[30][31]\\r\\nIn 2007 the tournament was hosted by the West Indies and expanded to sixteen teams.[32] Following Pakistan's upset loss to World Cup debutants Ireland in the group stage, Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room.[33] Jamaican police had initially launched a murder investigation into Woolmer's death but later confirmed that he died of heart failure.[34] Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the final by 53 runs (D/L) in farcical light conditions, and extended their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight championships.[35]\\r\\nIndia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh together hosted the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Pakistan were stripped of their hosting rights following the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009, with the games originally scheduled for Pakistan redistributed to the other host countries.[36] The number of teams participating in the World Cup dropped down to fourteen.[37] Australia lost their final group stage match against Pakistan on 19 March 2011, ending an unbeaten streak of 35 World Cup matches, which had begun on 23 May 1999.[38] India won their second World Cup title by beating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final in Mumbai, and became the first country to win the final on home soil.[37] MS Dhoni later became the first captain in history to win all the major ICC tournaments - World T20 in 2007, Champions Trophy in 2013 and this edition of the World Cup.\\r\\nAustralia and New Zealand jointly hosted the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The number of participants remained at fourteen. Ireland was the most successful Associate nation with a total of three wins in the tournament. New Zealand beat South Africa in a thrilling first semi-final to qualify for their maiden World Cup final. Australia defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the final at Melbourne to lift the World Cup for the fifth time.[39]\\r\\nThe Test-playing nations qualify automatically for the World Cup main event while the other teams have to qualify through a series of preliminary qualifying tournaments. A new qualifying format was introduced for the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The top two teams of the 2011ÿ13 ICC World Cricket League Championship qualify directly. The remaining six teams join the third and fourth-placed teams of 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two and the top two teams of the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three in the World Cup Qualifier to decide the remaining two places.[40][41]\\r\\nQualifying tournaments were introduced for the second World Cup, where two of the eight places in the finals were awarded to the leading teams in the ICC Trophy.[13] The number of teams selected through the ICC Trophy had varied throughout the years. The World Cricket League (administered by the International Cricket Council) is the qualification system provided to allow the Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC more opportunities to qualify. The name \\"ICC Trophy\\" has been changed to \\"ICC World Cup Qualifier\\".[42]\\r\\nUnder the current qualifying process, the World Cricket League, all Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC are able to qualify for the World Cup. Associate and Affiliate members must play between two and five stages in the ICC World Cricket League to qualify for the World Cup finals, depending on the Division in which they start the qualifying process.\\r\\nProcess summary in chronological order (2011-2014):\\r\\nThe format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. Each of the first four tournaments was played by eight teams, divided into two groups of four.[43] The competition consisted of two stages, a group stage and a knock-out stage. The four teams in each group played each other in the round-robin group stage, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final. With South Africa returning in the fifth tournament in 1992 as a result of the end of the apartheid boycott, nine teams played each other once in the group phase, and the top four teams progressed to the semi-finals.[44] The tournament was further expanded in 1996, with two groups of six teams.[45] The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter-finals and semi-finals.\\r\\nA distinct format was used for the 1999 and 2003 World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the Super 6.[46] The Super 6 teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group. As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages.[46] The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.\\r\\nThe format used in the 2007 World Cup involved 16 teams allocated into four groups of four.[47] Within each group, the teams played each other in a round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward to the Super 8 round. The Super 8 teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points in the same way as the group stage, but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the Super 8 stage.[48] The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.\\r\\nThe format used in the 2011 and 2015[49] World Cups featured two groups of seven teams, each playing in a round-robin format. The top four teams from each group proceeded to the knock out stage consisting of quarter-finals, semi-finals and ultimately the final.[50]\\r\\nIt is proposed that in 2019 World Cup, the number of teams participating will go down to 10 and all the teams will play against each other once in round robin format, before entering the semifinals. This would be similar to the one used in 1992 World Cup.\\r\\nThe ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the World Cup. The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships, and was the first permanent prize in the tournament's history. Prior to this, different trophies were made for each World Cup.[51] The trophy was designed and produced in London by a team of craftsmen from Garrard & Co over a period of two months.\\r\\nThe current trophy is made from silver and gilt, and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The columns, shaped as stumps and bails, represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket: batting, bowling and fielding, while the globe characterises a cricket ball.[52] The seam is tilted to symbolize the axial tilt of the Earth. It stands 60?centimetres high and weighs approximately 11?kilograms. The names of the previous winners are engraved on the base of the trophy, with space for a total of twenty inscriptions. The ICC keeps the original trophy. A replica differing only in the inscriptions is permanently awarded to the winning team.[53]\\r\\nThe tournament is the world's third largest[54] with only the FIFA World Cup and the Summer Olympics exceeding it. The 2011 Cricket World Cup final was televised in over 200 countries to over 2.2?billion television viewers.[55][56][57] Television rights, mainly for the 2011 and 2015 World Cup, were sold for over US$1.1?billion,[58] and sponsorship rights were sold for a further US$500?million.[59] The 2003 Cricket World Cup matches were attended by 626,845 people,[60] while the 2007 Cricket World Cup sold more than 672,000 tickets.[61][62]\\r\\nSuccessive World Cup tournaments have generated increasing media attention as One-Day International cricket has become more established. The 2003 World Cup in South Africa was the first to sport a mascot, Dazzler the zebra.[63] An orange mongoose known as Mello was the mascot for the 2007 Cricket World Cup.[64] Stumpy, a blue elephant was the mascot for the 2011 World Cup.[65]\\r\\nOn 13 February, the opening of the 2015 tournament was celebrated with a Google Doodle.[66]\\r\\nThe International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World Cup.[67]\\r\\nEngland hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event.[10] India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day.[68] The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.[69]\\r\\nMany of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as South Asia in 1987, 1996 and 2011, Australasia in 1992 and 2015, Southern Africa in 2003 and West Indies in 2007.\\r\\nTwenty nations have qualified for the Cricket World Cup at least once. Seven teams have competed in every tournament, five of which have won the title.[9] The West Indies won the first two tournaments, Australia has won five, India has won two, while Pakistan and Sri Lanka have each won once. The West Indies (1975 and 1979) and Australia (1999, 2003 and 2007) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles.[9] Australia has played in seven of the eleven finals (1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015). England has yet to win the World Cup, but has been runners-up three times (1979, 1987, 1992).

Driven by politics rather than any theological disagreement, the schism was ended by the Council of Constance (1414ÿ1418). For a time these rival claims to the papal throne damaged the reputation of the office. The affair is sometimes referred to as the Great Schism, although this term is typically reserved for the EastÿWest Schism (1054) between the Western Churches answering to the See of Rome and the Orthodox Churches of the East.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schism in the Western Roman Church resulted from the return of the papacy to Rome under Gregory XI on January 17, 1377,[2] ending the Avignon Papacy, which had developed a reputation for corruption that estranged major parts of Western Christendom. This reputation can be attributed to perceptions of predominant French influence and to the papal curia's efforts to extend its powers of patronage and increase its revenues.\\r\\nAfter Pope Gregory XI died in 1378, the Romans rioted to ensure the election of a Roman for pope. On April 8, 1378 the cardinals elected a Neapolitan when no viable Roman candidate presented himself. Urban VI, born Bartolomeo Prignano, the Archbishop of Bari, was elected. Urban had been a respected administrator in the papal chancery at Avignon, but as pope he proved suspicious, reformist, and prone to violent outbursts of temper. Many of the cardinals who had elected him soon regretted their decision: the majority removed themselves from Rome to Anagni, where, even though Urban was still reigning, they elected Robert of Geneva as a rival pope on September 20 of the same year. Robert took the name Clement VII and reestablished a papal court in Avignon. The second election threw the Church into turmoil. There had been antipopesrival claimants to the papacybefore, but most of them had been appointed by various rival factions; in this case, a single group of leaders of the Church had created both the pope and the antipope.\\r\\nThe conflicts quickly escalated from a church problem to a diplomatic crisis that divided Europe. Secular leaders had to choose which claimant they would recognize:\\r\\nIn the Iberian Peninsula there were the Fernandine Wars (Guerras fernandinas) and the 1383ÿ1385 Crisis in Portugal, during which dynastic opponents supported rival claimants to the papal office.\\r\\nSustained by such national and factional rivalries throughout Catholic Christianity, the schism continued after the deaths of both the Pope and the initial antipope claimant; Pope Boniface IX, crowned at Rome in 1389, and antipope Benedict XIII, who reigned in Avignon from 1394, maintained their rival courts. When Pope Boniface died in 1404, the eight cardinals of the Roman conclave offered to refrain from electing a new pope if Benedict would resign; but when Benedict's legates refused on his behalf, the Roman party then proceeded to elect Pope Innocent VII.\\r\\nIn the intense partisanship characteristic of the Middle Ages, the schism engendered a fanatical hatred noted by Johan Huizinga:[3] when the town of Bruges went over to the \\"obedience\\" of Avignon, a great number of people left to follow their trade in a city of Urbanist allegiance; in the 1382 Battle of Roosebeke, the oriflamme, which might only be unfurled in a holy cause, was taken up against the Flemings, because they were Urbanists and thus viewed by the French as schismatics[citation needed].\\r\\nEfforts were made to end the Schism through force or diplomacy. The French crown even tried to coerce antipope Benedict XIII, whom it nominally supported, into resigning. None of these remedies worked. The suggestion that a church council should resolve the Schism, first made in 1378, was not adopted at first because canon law required that a pope call a council. Eventually theologians like Pierre d'Ailly and Jean Gerson, as well as canon lawyers like Francesco Zabarella, adopted arguments that equity permitted the Church to act for its own welfare in defiance of the letter of the law.\\r\\nEventually the cardinals of both factions secured an agreement that Benedict and Pope Gregory XII would meet at Savona. They balked at the last moment, and both groups of cardinals abandoned their preferred leaders. A church council was held at Pisa in 1409 under the auspices of the cardinals to try solving the dispute. At the fifteenth session, 5 June 1409, the Council of Pisa attempted to depose both Pope and antipope as schismatical, heretical, perjured, and scandalous.[4] But it then added to the problem by electing a second antipope, Alexander V. He reigned briefly from June 26, 1409, to his death in 1410, when he was succeeded by antipope John XXIII, who won some but not universal support.\\r\\nFinally, a council was convened by Pisan antipope John XXIII in 1414 at Constance to resolve the issue. This was endorsed by Pope Gregory XII, Innocent VII's successor in Rome, thus ensuring the legitimacy of any election. The council, advised by the theologian Jean Gerson, secured the resignations of John XXIII and Pope Gregory XII, who resigned in 1415, while excommunicating the second antipope, Benedict XIII, who refused to step down. The Council elected Pope Martin V in 1417, essentially ending the schism. Nonetheless, the Crown of Aragon did not recognize Pope Martin V and continued to recognize Benedict XIII. Archbishops loyal to Benedict XIII subsequently elected Antipope Benedict XIV (Bernard Garnier) and three followers simultaneously elected Antipope Clement VIII, but the Western Schism was by then practically over. Clement VIII resigned in 1429 and apparently recognized Martin V.\\r\\nThe line of Roman popes is now recognized as the legitimate line, but confusion on this point continued until the 19th century. Pope Pius II (died 1464) decreed that no appeal could be made from pope to council, to avoid any future attempts to undo a papal election by anyone but the elected pope. No such crisis has arisen since the 15th century, and so there has been no need to revisit this decision. The alternate papal claimants have become known in history as antipopes. Those of Avignon were dismissed by Rome early on, but the Pisan popes were included in the Annuario Pontificio as popes well into the 20th century. Thus the Borgia pope Alexander VI took his regnal name in sequence after the Pisan Alexander V.\\r\\nGregory XII's resignation (in 1415) was the last time a pope would renounce his papacy before death, until the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI in early 2013.\\r\\nAccording to Broderick:\\r\\nDoubt still shrouds the validity of the three rival lines of pontiffs during the four decades subsequent to the still disputed papal election of 1378. This makes suspect the credentials of the cardinals created by the Roman, Avignon, and Pisan claimants to the Apostolic See. Unity was finally restored without a definitive solution to the question; for the Council of Constance succeeded in terminating the Western Schism, not by declaring which of the three claimants was the rightful one, but by eliminating all of them by forcing their abdication or deposition, and then setting up a novel arrangement for choosing a new pope acceptable to all sides. To this day the Church has never made any official, authoritative pronouncement about the papal lines of succession for this confusing period; nor has Martin V or any of his successors. Modern scholars are not agreed in their solutions, although they tend to favor the Roman line.[5]","input":"How many popes were there during the great schism?"},{"output":"Harvey","context":"This is a list of costliest Atlantic hurricanes. Hurricanes, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), are tropical cyclonesa warm-core, non-frontal synoptic-scale cyclone, originating over tropical or subtropical waters with organized deep convection and a closed surface wind circulation about a well-defined centerin the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, or eastern Pacific, in which the maximum 1-minute sustained surface wind exceeds 64 knots (74?mph; 119?km/h) or greater. The hurricanes on the list below depict the severity of the damage the system has caused. Typically, if a hurricane has caused significant damage to a particular location, its name is retired so that it will not be re-used as a name for any future hurricanes. The costliest tropical cyclone ever recorded was Hurricane Harvey, which caused catastrophic flooding in southeastern Texas, in August?2017, causing $125 billion (2017 USD) in property damage. The costliest season on record was 2017, with damage estimated to around $300?billion.\\r\\nA majority of the costliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history have peaked as major hurricanes. However, weaker tropical cyclones can still cause widespread damage. Both tropical storms Allison in 2001 and Lee in 2011 have caused over a billion in damage; the former of which accounted for a higher damage total. Due to their excessive damage, the names of tropical cyclones accruing at least $1?billion in damage are often retired by the World Meteorological Organization. However, this is not always the case. Hurricane Juan in 1985 was the first hurricane to cause at least a billion in damage and not be retired; its name was retired on a later usage in 2003 that did not cause over a billion in damage. Since Juan, seven tropical cyclones that caused at least a billion in damage were not retired, including Hurricane Emily in 2005, and the most recent of which being Hurricane Isaac in 2012. All other 46?Atlantic hurricanes to have caused as much damage have had their names retired, excluding recent hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria of the 2017 season.\\r\\nThe first hurricane to cause at least $1?billion in damage was Hurricane Betsy in 1965, which caused much of its damage in southeastern Louisiana. Between two and four years later, Hurricanes Beulah and Camille both caused at least $1?billion in damage. After the 1960s, each decade saw an increase in tropical cyclones causing at least a billion in damage over the last, due to increasing urban development and population. In the 1970s, four hurricanes caused at least a billion in damage; the costliest of which was Hurricane Frederic, which caused $2.3?billion in damage, particularly in Mississippi and Alabama. The following decade featured seven hurricanes causing at least a billion in damage. In the 1989 season, Hurricane Hugo was the first storm to hit $10 billion U.S. dollars in cost. In the 1990s, nine tropical cyclones accrued at least a billion in damage. Hurricane Andrew in 1992 greatly exceeded the damage figure of any preceding tropical cyclone after causing $26.5?billion in damage, mostly in South Florida. Seventeen tropical cyclones in the 2000s caused at least $1?billion in damage. The 2005 season had six billion-dollar hurricanes, the most of any season on record. Hurricane Ivan caused at least $1?billion in damage in four separate countries, and according to estimates, Hurricane Irma caused at least $1?billion in damage in five separate countries. Thus far in the 2010s, eleven storms have caused at least $1?billion in damage, with the costliest so far being Hurricane Harvey which caused $125?billion in damage.\\r\\nThis list ranks tropical cyclones within the Atlantic that have accrued at least US$1?billion in damage, based on their nominal USD damage totals. Because these numbers have not been adjusted for inflation, nor adjusted for changes in population and wealth in coastal counties, the costliness of recent hurricanes is artificially inflated compared to hurricanes of the past. This makes it hard to accurately compare the damage inflicted by hurricanes across time.","input":"What is the most costliest hurricane in us history?"},{"output":"British English","context":"The culture of the Cayman Islands has been influenced by Afro-Caribbeans of Jamaica, colonists of Great Britain, and more recent immigrants from the United States.

It was created as an auxiliary unit, the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) on 15 May 1942 by Public Law 554,[1] and converted to an active duty status in the Army of the United States as the WAC on 1 July 1943. Its first director was Oveta Culp Hobby, a prominent women in Texas society.[2][3] The WAC was disbanded in 1978, and all units were integrated with male units.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe WAAC's organization was designed by numerous Army bureaus coordinated by Lt. Col. Gilman C. Mudgett, the first WAAC Pre-Planner; however, nearly all of his plans were discarded or greatly modified before going into operation because he expected a corps of only 11,000 women.[4] Without the support of the War Department, Representative Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts introduced a bill on 28 May 1941, providing for a womens army auxiliary corps. The bill was held up for months by the Bureau of the Budget but was resurrected after the United States entered the war and became law on 15 May 1942. A section authorizing the enlistment of 150,000 volunteers was temporarily limited by executive order to 25,000.[5]\\r\\nThe WAAC was modeled after comparable British units, especially the ATS, which caught the attention of Chief of Staff George C. Marshall.[6] In 1942, the first contingent of 800 members of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps began basic training at Fort Des Moines Provisional Army Officer Training School, Iowa. The women were fitted for uniforms, interviewed, assigned to companies and barracks and inoculated against disease during the first day.[7]\\r\\nThe WAAC were first trained in three major specialties. The brightest and nimblest were trained as switchboard operators. Next came the mechanics, who had to have a high degree of mechanical aptitude and problem solving ability. The bakers were usually the lowest scoring recruits and were stereotyped as being the least intelligent and able by their fellow WAACs. This was later expanded to dozens of specialties like Postal Clerk, Driver, Stenographer, and Clerk-Typist. WAC armorers maintained and repaired small arms and heavy weapons that they were not allowed to use. The WAC provided enlisted seamstresses to tailor WAC uniforms to their wearer - a service they also provided to male officers.\\r\\nA physical training manual titled \\"You Must Be Fit\\" was published by the War Department in July 1943, aimed at bringing the women recruits to top physical standards. The manual begins by naming the responsibility of the women: \\"Your Job: To Replace Men. Be Ready To Take Over.\\"[8] It cited the commitment of women to the war effort in England, Russia, Germany and Japan, and emphasized that the WAC recruits must be physically able to take on any job assigned to them. The fitness manual was state-of-the-art for its day, with sections on warming up, and progressive body-weight strength-building exercises for the arms, legs, stomach, and neck and back. It included a section on designing a personal fitness routine after basic training, and concluded with \\"The Army Way to Health and Added Attractiveness\\" with advice on skin care, make-up, and hair styles.[8]\\r\\nInept publicity and the poor appearance of the WAAC/WAC uniform, especially in comparison to that of the other services, handicapped recruiting efforts. A resistance by senior Army commanders was overcome by the efficient service of WAACs in the field, but the attitude of men in the rank and file remained generally negative and hopes that up to a million men could be replaced by women never materialized. The United States Army Air Forces became an early and staunch supporter of regular military status for women in the army.[5]\\r\\nAbout 150,000[9] American women eventually served in the WAAC and WAC during World War II. They were the first women other than nurses to serve with the Army.[10] While conservative opinion in the leadership of the Army and public opinion generally was initially opposed to women serving in uniform, the shortage of men necessitated a new policy. While most women served stateside, some went to various places around the world, including Europe, North Africa, and New Guinea. For example, WACs landed on Normandy Beach just a few weeks after the initial invasion.[11]\\r\\nIn 1943 the recruiting momentum stopped and went into reverse as a massive slander campaign on the home front challenged the WACs as sexually immoral.[12] Many soldiers ferociously opposed allowing women in uniform, warning their sisters and friends they would be seen as lesbians or prostitutes. Their lewd humor and snide comments betrayed a fear that if women became soldiers they would no longer serve in a masculine preserve and their masculinity would be devalued.[13] Other men, seeing the posters that called on women to volunteer in order to \\"Free a Man to Fight\\" feared being sent into combat units if women took the safe jobs. Critics outside the military included those with religious objections, reactionaries who wanted to prevent social change, and right-wing critics of Roosevelt's social programs. Other sources were from other women - servicemen's and officer's wives' idle gossip, local women who disliked the newcomers taking over \\"their town\\", female civilian employees resenting the competition (for both jobs and men), charity and volunteer organizations who resented the extra attention the WAACs received, and complaints and slander spread by disgruntled or discharged WAACs.[14] All investigations showed the rumors were false, but they had originated with American soldiers, not with enemy agents.[15][16]\\r\\nAnother factor was that the WAAC uniform was widely copied. Women factory workers often wore military-looking utilitarian beige, khaki, olive drab, or pearl-gray slacks or skirts with matching jackets and white, beige, khaki, or olive drab blouses that looked like a uniform. Similar uniforms were worn by female civilian workers and members of civilian women's volunteer and auxiliary organizations.[17] Department stores sold exact copies of the uniform to patriotic young girls (\\"Junior WAACs\\") and women who were working for women's volunteer and auxiliary organizations like Military Canteens, Civil Defense, the American Red Cross, and the USO. The dressmaking firms who manufactured them ironically got priority over the WAACs for allotments of Olive Drab and Khaki cloth because they also made men's uniforms for the military. If women wearing these faux uniforms got in fights or brawls, were publicly intoxicated, or were caught \\"behaving inappropriately\\" (everything from walking after dark with a man to having sex with him) while in uniform, they were initially assumed to be WAACs. Add to them the number of \\"Victory Girls\\" (thrill-seeking local teen girls who slept with servicemen), local \\"townie\\" women, and prostitutes - they often dressed in uniform as either a kink, a means to commit fraud by pretending to be servicewomen, or get access to military installations to meet servicemen. Legitimate WACs who had duties off base often had to wear a \\"field sign\\" (an expedient symbol to tell friend from foe) to distinguish them from the throngs of imitators trying to sneak on base.\\r\\nAfrican American women eager to serve experienced bias on multiple levels: they were organized in segregated units, often assigned to janitorial or orderly roles well below their training and education, sent as dates to sites where African American men were stationed (so those men would not seek out the company of local white women), denied access to many Red Cross and officers' clubs, and, like their male counterparts, subject to having their donated blood segregated from that of white donors.\\r\\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur called the WACs \\"my best soldiers\\", adding that they worked harder, complained less, and were better disciplined than men.[18] Many generals wanted more of them and proposed to draft women but it was realized that this \\"would provoke considerable public outcry and Congressional opposition\\", and so the War Department declined to take such a drastic step.[19] Those 150,000 women who did serve released the equivalent of 7 divisions of men for combat. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower said that \\"their contributions in efficiency, skill, spirit, and determination are immeasurable\\".[20] Nevertheless, the slander campaign hurt the reputation of the WAC and WAVES; women did not want it known they were veterans.[21]\\r\\nDuring the same time period, other branches of the U.S. military had similar women's units, including the Navy WAVES, the SPARS of the Coast Guard, United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve, and the (civil) Women Airforce Service Pilots. The British Armed Forces also had similar units, including the Women's Royal Naval Service (\\"Wrens\\"), the Auxiliary Territorial Service. and the Women's Auxiliary Air Force.\\r\\nAccording to historian D'Ann Campbell, American society was not ready for women in military roles:\\r\\nThe WAC as a branch was disbanded in 1978 and all female units were integrated with male units. Women serving as WACs at that time converted in branch to whichever Military Occupational Specialty they worked in. Since then, women in the US Army have served in the same units as men, though they have only been allowed in or near combat situations since 1994 when Defense Secretary Les Aspin ordered the removal of \\"substantial risk of capture\\" from the list of grounds for excluding women from certain military units. In 2015 Jeanne Pace, at the time the longest-tenured female warrant officer and the last former member of the WAC on active duty, retired.[23][24][25] She had joined the WAC in 1972.[24]\\r\\nOriginally there were only four enlisted (or \\"enrolled\\") WAAC ranks (auxiliary, junior leader, leader, and senior leader) and three WAC officer ranks (first, second and third officer). The Director was initially considered as equivalent to a major, then later made the equivalent of a colonel. The enlisted ranks expanded as the organization grew in size. Promotion was initially rapid and based on ability and skill. As members of a volunteer auxiliary group, the WAACs got paid less than their equivalent male counterparts in the US Army and did not receive any benefits or privileges.\\r\\nWAAC organizational insignia was a Rising Eagle (nicknamed the \\"Waddling Duck\\" or \\"Walking Buzzard\\" by WAACs). It was worn in gold metal as cap badges and uniform buttons. Enlisted and NCO personnel wore it as an embossed circular cap badge on their Hobby Hats, while officers wore a \\"free\\" version (open work without a backing) on their hats to distinguish them. Their auxiliary insignia was the dark blue letters \\"WAAC\\" on an Olive Drab rectangle worn on the upper sleeve (below the stripes for enlisted ranks). WAAC personnel were not allowed to wear the same rank insignia as Army personnel. They were usually authorized to do so by post or unit commanders to help in indicating their seniority within the WAAC, although they had no authority over Army personnel.\\r\\nThe organization was renamed the Women's Army Corps in July 1943[26] when it was authorized as a branch of the US Army rather than an auxiliary group. The US Army's \\"GI Eagle\\" now replaced the WAAC's Rising Eagle as the WAC's cap badge. The WAC received the same rank insignia and pay as men later that September and received the same pay allowances and deductions as men in late October.[27] They were also the first women officers in the army allowed to wear officer's insignia; the Army Nursing Corps didn't receive permission to do so until 1944.\\r\\nThe WAC had its own branch insignia (the Bust of Pallas Athena), worn by \\"Branch Immaterial\\" personnel (those unassigned to a Branch of Service). US Army policy decreed that technical and professional WAC personnel should wear their assigned Branch of Service insignia to reduce confusion. During the existence of the WAC (1943 to 1978) women were prohibited from being assigned to the combat arms branches of the Army - such as the Infantry, Cavalry, Armor, Tank Destroyers, or Artillery and could not serve in a combat area. However, they did serve as valuable staff in their headquarters and staff units stateside or in England.\\r\\nThe army's technician grades were technical and professional specialists similar to the later specialist grade. Technicians had the same insignia as NCOs of the same grade but had a \\"T\\" insignia (for \\"technician\\") beneath the chevrons. They were considered the same grade for pay but were considered a half-step between the equivalent pay grade and the next lower regular pay grade in seniority, rather than sandwiched between the junior enlisted (i.e., private - private first class) and the lowest NCO grade of rank (viz., corporal), as the modern-day specialist (E-4) is today. Technician grades were usually mistaken for their superior NCO counterparts due to the similarity of their insignia, creating confusion.\\r\\nThere were originally no warrant officers in the WAC in July, 1943. Warrant officer appointments for army servicewomen were authorized in January 1944. In March 1944 six WACs were made the first WAC Warrant Officers - as administrative specialists or band leaders. The number grew to 10 by June, 1944 and to 44 by June, 1945. By the time the war officially ended in September 1945, there were 42 WAC warrant officers still in Army service. There was only a trickle of appointments in the late 1940s after the war.\\r\\nMost WAC officers were company-grade officers (lieutenants and captains), as the WAC were deployed as separate or attached detachments and companies. The field grade officers (majors and lieutenant-colonels) were on the staff under the director of the WAC, its solitary colonel.[28] Officers were paid by pay band rather than by grade or rank and didn't receive a pay grade until 1955.\\r\\nThe Women's Army Corps Veterans' Association was organized to serve those who have served honorably with the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, The Women's Army Corps, or those who have served or are serving honorably in the United States Army, the United States Army Reserve or the Army National Guard of the United States.[29]\\r\\nLt. Col. Charity Adams was the first commissioned African-American WAC and the second to be promoted to the rank of major. Promoted to major in 1945, she commanded the segregated all-female 6888th Central Postal Battalion in Birmingham, England. The 6888th landed with the follow-on troops during D-Day and were stationed in Rouen and then Paris during the invasion of France. It was the only African-American WAC unit to serve overseas during World War II.[30]\\r\\nLt. Col. Harriet West Waddy (b.1904-d.1999 [served 1942-1952])[31] was one of only two African-American women in the WAC to be promoted to the rank of major.

Apart from a very uncertain process used on the Turin Shroud there are no artifacts or descriptions that indicate that anyone even imagined capturing images with light sensitive materials before the 18th century. Around 1717 Johann Heinrich Schulze captured cut-out letters on a bottle of a light-sensitive slurry, but he apparently never thought of making the results durable. Around 1800 Thomas Wedgwood made the first reliably documented, although unsuccessful attempt at capturing camera images in permanent form. His experiments did produce detailed photograms, but Wedgwood and his associate Humphry Davy found no way to fix these images.\\r\\nIn the mid-1820s, Nicphore Nipce first managed to fix an image that was captured with a camera, but at least eight hours or even several days of exposure in the camera were required and the earliest results were very crude. Nipce's associate Louis Daguerre went on to develop the daguerreotype process, the first publicly announced and commercially viable photographic process. The daguerreotype required only minutes of exposure in the camera, and produced clear, finely detailed results. The details were introduced as a gift to the world in 1839, a date generally accepted as the birth year of practical photography.[1][2] The metal-based daguerreotype process soon had some competition from the paper-based calotype negative and salt print processes invented by William Henry Fox Talbot. Subsequent innovations made photography easier and more versatile. New materials reduced the required camera exposure time from minutes to seconds, and eventually to a small fraction of a second; new photographic media were more economical, sensitive or convenient, including roll films for casual use by amateurs. In the mid-20th century, developments made it possible for amateurs to take pictures in natural color as well as in black-and-white.\\r\\nThe commercial introduction of computer-based electronic digital cameras in the 1990s soon revolutionized photography. During the first decade of the 21st century, traditional film-based photochemical methods were increasingly marginalized as the practical advantages of the new technology became widely appreciated and the image quality of moderately priced digital cameras was continually improved. Especially since cameras became a standard feature on smartphones, taking pictures (and instantly publishing them online) has become an ubiquitous everyday practice around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coining of the word \\"photography\\" is usually attributed to Sir John Herschel in 1839. It is based on the Greek ?? (phs), (genitive: pht܇s) meaning \\"light\\", and ϫ? (graph), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\".[3]\\r\\nA natural phenomenon, known as camera obscura or pinhole image, can project a (reversed) image through a small opening onto an opposite surface. This principle may have been known and used in prehistoric times. The earliest known written record of the camera obscura is to be found in Chinese writings called Mozi, dated to the 4th century BCE. Until the 16th century the camera obscura was mainly used to study optics and astronomy, especially to safely watch solar eclipses without damaging the eyes. In the later half of the 16th century some technical improvements were developed: a (biconvex) lens in the opening (first described by Gerolamo Cardano in 1550) and a diaphragm restricting the aperture (Daniel Barbaro in 1568) gave a brighter and sharper image. In 1558 Giambattista della Porta advised using the camera obscura as a drawing aid in his popular and influential books. Della Porta's advice was widely adopted by artists and since the 17th century portable versions of the camera obscura were commonly used - first as a tent, later as boxes. The box type camera obscura was the basis for the earliest photographic cameras when photography was developed in the early 19th century.\\r\\nThe notion that light can affect various substances - for instance the suntanning of skin or fading of textile - must have been around since very early times. Ideas of fixing the image seen in mirrors or other ways of creating images automatically may also have been in people's mind long before anything like photography was developed.[4] However, there seem to be no historical records of any ideas even remotely resembling photography before 1725, despite early knowledge of light-sensitive materials and the camera obscura.[5]\\r\\nIt has been suggested that some lost type of photographic technology must have been applied before 1357: the Shroud of Turin contains an image that resembles a sepia photographic negative and is much clearer when it is converted to a positive image. The actual method that resulted in this image has not yet been conclusively identified. It first appeared in historical records in 1357 and radiocarbon dating tests indicate it was probably made between 1260 and 1390.[6] No other examples of detailed negative images from before the 19th century are known.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlbertus Magnus (1193/1206ÿ80) discovered silver nitrate and noted that it could blacken skin.[7] Silver nitrate would later be used as a light sensitive material in the photographic emulsion on photographic glass plates and film.\\r\\nGeorg Fabricius (1516ÿ71) discovered silver chloride, later used to make photographic paper.[8]\\r\\nIn 1614 Angelo Sala wrote in his paper Septem Planetarum terrestrium Spagirica recensio[9]: \\"When you expose powdered silver nitrate to sunlight, it turns black as ink\\". He also noted that paper wrapped around silver nitrate for a year had turned black.[10]\\r\\nWilhelm Homberg described how light darkened some chemicals (photochemical effect) in 1694.[8]\\r\\nAround 1717[11] German polymath Johann Heinrich Schulze accidentally discovered that a slurry of chalk and nitric acid into which some silver particles had been dissolved was darkened by sunlight. After experiments with threads that had created lines on the bottled substance after he placed it in direct sunlight for a while, he applied stencils of words to the bottle. The stencils produced copies of the text in dark red, almost violet characters on the surface of the otherwise whitish contents. The impressions persisted until they were erased by shaking the bottle or until overall exposure to light obliterated them. Schulze named the substance \\"Scotophorus\\", when he published his findings in 1719. He thought the discovery could be applied to detect whether metals or minerals contained any silver and hoped that further experimentation by others would lead to some other useful results.[12][13] Schulze's process resembled later photogram techniques and is sometimes regarded as the very first form of photography.[14]\\r\\nThe early science fiction novel Giphantie[15] (1760) by the French Tiphaigne de la Roche described something quite similar to (colour) photography, a process that fixes fleeting images formed by rays of light:\\"They coat a piece of canvas with this material, and place it in front of the object to capture. The first effect of this cloth is similar to that of a mirror, but by means of its viscous nature the prepared canvas, as is not the case with the mirror, retains a facsimile of the image. The mirror represents images faithfully, but retains none; our canvas reflects them no less faithfully, but retains them all. This impression of the image is instantaneous. The canvas is then removed and deposited in a dark place. An hour later the impression is dry, and you have a picture the more precious in that no art can imitate its truthfulness.\\"[16] De la Roche thus imagined a process that made use of a special substance in combination with the qualities of a mirror, rather than the camera obscura. The hour of drying in a dark place suggests he possibly thought about the light sensitivity of the material, but he attributes the effect to its viscous nature.\\r\\nIn 1777, the chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele was studying the more intrinsically light-sensitive silver chloride and determined that light darkened it by disintegrating it into microscopic dark particles of metallic silver. Of greater potential usefulness, Scheele found that ammonia dissolved the silver chloride but not the dark particles. This discovery could have been used to stabilize or \\"fix\\" a camera image captured with silver chloride, but was not picked up by the earliest photography experimenters.[citation needed]\\r\\nScheele also noted that red light did not have much effect on silver chloride (a feature that would later be applied to be able to see while printing black and white photographs in darkrooms).[17]\\r\\nAlthough Thomas Wedgwood felt inspired by Scheele's writings in general, he must have missed or forgotten these experiments: he found no method to fix the photogram and shadow images he managed to capture around 1800 (see below).[17]\\r\\nThomas Wedgwood (1771-1805) is believed to have been the first person to have thought of creating permanent pictures by capturing camera images on material coated with a light-sensitive chemical. He originally wanted to capture the images of a camera obscura, but found they were too faint to have an effect upon the silver nitrate solution that was advised to him as a light-sensitive substance. Wedgwood did manage to copy painted glass plates and captured shadows on white leather as well as on paper moistened with a silver nitrate solution. Attempts to preserve the results with their \\"distinct tints of brown or black, sensibly differing in intensity\\" failed. It is unclear when Wedgwood's experiments took place. He may have started before 1790; James Watt wrote a letter to Thomas Wedgwood's father Josiah Wedgwood to thank him \\"for your instructions as to the Silver Pictures, about which, when at home, I will make some experiments\\". This letter (now lost) is believed to have been written in 1790, 1791 or 1799. In 1802 an account by Humphry Davy detailing Wedgwood's experiments was published in an early journal of the Royal Institution with the title An Account of a Method of Copying Paintings upon Glass, and of Making Profiles, by the Agency of Light upon Nitrate of Silver. Davy added that the method could be used for objects that are partly opaque and partly transparent to create accurate representations of for instance \\"the woody fibres of leaves and the wings of insects\\". He also found that solar microscope images of small objects were easily captured on prepared paper. Davy, apparently unaware or forgetful about Scheele's discovery, concluded that substances should be found to get rid of (or deactivate) the unexposed particles in silver nitrate or silver chloride \\"to render the process as useful as it is elegant\\".[17] Wedgwood may have prematurely abandoned his experiments due to his frail and failing health. He died aged 34 in 1805.\\r\\nDavy seems not to have continued the experiments. Although the journal of the small, infant Royal Institution probably reached its very small group of members, the article eventually must have been read by many more people. It was reviewed by David Brewster in the Edinburgh Magazine in December 1802, appeared in chemistry textbooks as early as 1803, was translated into French, and published in German in 1811. Readers of the article may have been discouraged to find a fixer, because the highly acclaimed scientist Davy had already tried and failed. Apparently the article was not noted by Nipce or Daguerre, and by Talbot only after he had developed his own processes.[17][18]\\r\\nFrench balloonist/professor/inventor Jacques Charles is believed to have captured fleeting negative photograms of silhouettes on light sensitive paper at the start of the 19th century, prior to Westwood. Charles died in 1823 without documenting the process, but purportedly demonstrated it in his lectures at the Louvre. It was not publicized until Fran?ois Arago mentioned it at his introduction of the details of the Daguerreotype to the world in 1839. He later wrote that the first idea of fixing the images of the camera obscura or the solar microscope with chemical substances belonged to Charles. Later historians probably only built on Arago's information and much later the unsupported year 1780 was attached to it.[19] Since Arago indicated the first years of the 19th century and a date prior to Wedgwood's process published in 1802, this would mean that Charles' demonstrations took place in 1800 or 1801 - assuming Arago was this accurate almost 40 years later.\\r\\nIn 1816 Nicphore Nipce, using paper coated with silver chloride, succeeded in photographing the images formed in a small camera, but the photographs were negatives, darkest where the camera image was lightest and vice versa, and they were not permanent in the sense of being reasonably light-fast; like earlier experimenters, Nipce could find no way to prevent the coating from darkening all over when it was exposed to light for viewing. Disenchanted with silver salts, he turned his attention to light-sensitive organic substances.[21]\\r\\nThe oldest surviving photograph of the image formed in a camera was created by Nipce in 1826 or 1827.[1] It was made on a polished sheet of pewter and the light-sensitive substance was a thin coating of bitumen, a naturally occurring petroleum tar, which was dissolved in lavender oil, applied to the surface of the pewter and allowed to dry before use.[23] After a very long exposure in the camera (traditionally said to be eight hours, but now believed to be several days),[24] the bitumen was sufficiently hardened in proportion to its exposure to light that the unhardened part could be removed with a solvent, leaving a positive image with the light areas represented by hardened bitumen and the dark areas by bare pewter.[23] To see the image plainly, the plate had to be lit and viewed in such a way that the bare metal appeared dark and the bitumen relatively light.[21]\\r\\nIn partnership, Nipce in Chalon-sur-Sa?ne and Louis Daguerre in Paris refined the bitumen process,[25] substituting a more sensitive resin and a very different post-exposure treatment that yielded higher-quality and more easily viewed images. Exposure times in the camera, although substantially reduced, were still measured in hours.[21]\\r\\nNipce died suddenly in 1833, leaving his notes to Daguerre. More interested in silver-based processes than Nipce had been, Daguerre experimented with photographing camera images directly onto a mirror-like silver-surfaced plate that had been fumed with iodine vapor, which reacted with the silver to form a coating of silver iodide. As with the bitumen process, the result appeared as a positive when it was suitably lit and viewed. Exposure times were still impractically long until Daguerre made the pivotal discovery that an invisibly slight or \\"latent\\" image produced on such a plate by a much shorter exposure could be \\"developed\\" to full visibility by mercury fumes. This brought the required exposure time down to a few minutes under optimum conditions. A strong hot solution of common salt served to stabilize or fix the image by removing the remaining silver iodide. On 7 January 1839, this first complete practical photographic process was announced at a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences,[26] and the news quickly spread.[27] At first, all details of the process were withheld and specimens were shown only at Daguerre's studio, under his close supervision, to Academy members and other distinguished guests.[28] Arrangements were made for the French government to buy the rights in exchange for pensions for Nipce's son and Daguerre and present the invention to the world (with the exception of Great Britain, where an agent for Daguerre patented it) as a free gift.[29] Complete instructions were made public on 19 August 1839.[30] Known as the Daguerreotype process, it was the most common commercial process until the late 1850s. It was superseded by the collodion process.\\r\\nAfter reading early reports of Daguerre's invention, Henry Fox Talbot, who had succeeded in creating stabilized photographic negatives on paper in 1835, worked on perfecting his own process. In early 1839, he acquired a key improvement, an effective fixer, from his friend John Herschel, a polymath scientist who had previously shown that hyposulfite of soda (commonly called \\"hypo\\" and now known formally as sodium thiosulfate) would dissolve silver salts.[31] News of this solvent also benefited Daguerre, who soon adopted it as a more efficient alternative to his original hot salt water method.[32]\\r\\nTalbot's early silver chloride \\"sensitive paper\\" experiments required camera exposures of an hour or more. In 1841, Talbot invented the calotype process, which, like Daguerre's process, used the principle of chemical development of a faint or invisible \\"latent\\" image to reduce the exposure time to a few minutes. Paper with a coating of silver iodide was exposed in the camera and developed into a translucent negative image. Unlike a daguerreotype, which could only be copied by rephotographing it with a camera, a calotype negative could be used to make a large number of positive prints by simple contact printing. The calotype had yet another distinction compared to other early photographic processes, in that the finished product lacked fine clarity due to its translucent paper negative. This was seen as a positive attribute for portraits because it softened the appearance of the human face[citation needed]. Talbot patented this process,[33] which greatly limited its adoption, and spent many years pressing lawsuits against alleged infringers. He attempted to enforce a very broad interpretation of his patent, earning himself the ill will of photographers who were using the related glass-based processes later introduced by other inventors, but he was eventually defeated. Nonetheless, Talbot's developed-out silver halide negative process is the basic technology used by chemical film cameras today. Hippolyte Bayard had also developed a method of photography but delayed announcing it, and so was not recognized as its inventor.\\r\\nIn 1839, John Herschel made the first glass negative, but his process was difficult to reproduce. Slovene Janez Puhar invented a process for making photographs on glass in 1841; it was recognized on June 17, 1852 in Paris by the Acadmie Nationale Agricole, Manufacturire et Commerciale.[34] In 1847, Nicephore Nipce's cousin, the chemist Nipce St. Victor, published his invention of a process for making glass plates with an albumen emulsion; the Langenheim brothers of Philadelphia and John Whipple and William Breed Jones of Boston also invented workable negative-on-glass processes in the mid-1840s.[35]\\r\\nIn 1851 Frederick Scott Archer invented the collodion process.[36] Photographer and children's author Lewis Carroll used this process. (Carroll refers to the process as \\"Tablotype\\" [sic] in the story \\"A Photographer's Day Out\\")[37]\\r\\nHerbert Bowyer Berkeley experimented with his own version of collodion emulsions after Samman introduced the idea of adding dithionite to the pyrogallol developer.[citation needed] Berkeley discovered that with his own addition of sulfite, to absorb the sulfur dioxide given off by the chemical dithionite in the developer, that dithionite was not required in the developing process. In 1881 he published his discovery. Berkeley's formula contained pyrogallol, sulfite and citric acid. Ammonia was added just before use to make the formula alkaline. The new formula was sold by the Platinotype Company in London as Sulpho-Pyrogallol Developer.[38]\\r\\nNineteenth-century experimentation with photographic processes frequently became proprietary.The German-born, New Orleans photographer Theodore Lilienthal successfully sought legal redress in an 1881 infringement case involving his \\"Lambert Process\\" in the Eastern District of Louisiana.\\r\\nThe daguerreotype proved popular in response to the demand for portraiture that emerged from the middle classes during the Industrial Revolution.[citation needed] This demand, which could not be met in volume and in cost by oil painting, added to the push for the development of photography.\\r\\nRoger Fenton and Philip Henry Delamotte helped popularize the new way of recording events, the first by his Crimean war pictures, the second by his record of the disassembly and reconstruction of The Crystal Palace in London. Other mid-nineteenth-century photographers established the medium as a more precise means than engraving or lithography of making a record of landscapes and architecture: for example, Robert Macpherson's broad range of photographs of Rome, the interior of the Vatican, and the surrounding countryside became a sophisticated tourist's visual record of his own travels.\\r\\nIn America, by 1851 a broadside by daguerreotypist Augustus Washington was advertising prices ranging from 50 cents to $10.[39] However, daguerreotypes were fragile and difficult to copy. Photographers encouraged chemists to refine the process of making many copies cheaply, which eventually led them back to Talbot's process.\\r\\nUltimately, the photographic process came about from a series of refinements and improvements in the first 20 years. In 1884 George Eastman, of Rochester, New York, developed dry gel on paper, or film, to replace the photographic plate so that a photographer no longer needed to carry boxes of plates and toxic chemicals around. In July 1888 Eastman's Kodak camera went on the market with the slogan \\"You press the button, we do the rest\\". Now anyone could take a photograph and leave the complex parts of the process to others, and photography became available for the mass-market in 1901 with the introduction of the Kodak Brownie.\\r\\nDaguerreotype cameras were advertised in Calcutta a year after their invention in France  but photographic societies in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras were beginning to pop up from the 1850s onward. [40] As the practice of photography evolved, a contrasting style developed alongside the predominantly European influence on the art form. This turn is most notable in the work of Raja Deen Dayal, Indias most celebrated 19th-century photographer, whose appointment as court photographer to the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad allowed him unique access to the inner circles of aristocratic life. [41]\\r\\nPerhaps Mrs. E. Mayer holds the distinction of being the first professional woman photographer in India. She opened a studio in 7 Old Court House Street Corner to provide a rare treat to Indian women: to be photographed without fear or concern. [42]\\r\\nA practical means of color photography was sought from the very beginning. Results were demonstrated by Edmond Becquerel as early as 1848, but exposures lasting for hours or days were required and the captured colors were so light-sensitive they would only bear very brief inspection in dim light.\\r\\nThe first durable color photograph was a set of three black-and-white photographs taken through red, green, and blue color filters and shown superimposed by using three projectors with similar filters. It was taken by Thomas Sutton in 1861 for use in a lecture by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, who had proposed the method in 1855.[43] The photographic emulsions then in use were insensitive to most of the spectrum, so the result was very imperfect and the demonstration was soon forgotten. Maxwell's method is now most widely known through the early 20th century work of Sergei Prokudin-Gorskii. It was made practical by Hermann Wilhelm Vogel's 1873 discovery of a way to make emulsions sensitive to the rest of the spectrum, gradually introduced into commercial use beginning in the mid-1880s.\\r\\nTwo French inventors, Louis Ducos du Hauron and Charles Cros, working unknown to each other during the 1860s, famously unveiled their nearly identical ideas on the same day in 1869. Included were methods for viewing a set of three color-filtered black-and-white photographs in color without having to project them, and for using them to make full-color prints on paper.[44]\\r\\nThe first widely used method of color photography was the Autochrome plate, a process inventors and brothers Auguste and Louis Lumire began working on in the 1890s and commercially introduced in 1907.[45] It was based on one of Louis Ducos du Hauron's ideas: instead of taking three separate photographs through color filters, take one through a mosaic of tiny color filters overlaid on the emulsion and view the results through an identical mosaic. If the individual filter elements were small enough, the three primary colors of red, blue, and green would blend together in the eye and produce the same additive color synthesis as the filtered projection of three separate photographs.\\r\\nAutochrome plates had an integral mosaic filter layer with roughly five million previously dyed potato grains per square inch added to the surface. Then through the use of a rolling press, five tons of pressure were used to flatten the grains, enabling every one of them to capture and absorb color and their microscopic size allowing the illusion that the colors are merged together. The final step was adding a coat of the light capturing substance silver bromide after which a color image could be imprinted and developed. In order to see it, reversal processing was used to develop each plate into a transparent positive that could be viewed directly or projected with an ordinary projector. One of the drawbacks of the technology is an exposure time of at least a second was required during the day in bright light and the worse the light is, the time required quickly goes up. An indoor portrait required a few minutes with the subject not being able to move or else the picture would come out blurry. This was because the grains absorbed the color fairly slowly and that a filter of a yellowish-orange color was added to the plate to keep the photograph from coming out excessively blue. Although necessary, the filter had the effect of reducing the amount of light that was absorbed. Another drawback was that the film could only be enlarged so much until the many dots that make up the image become apparent.[45][46]\\r\\nCompeting screen plate products soon appeared and film-based versions were eventually made. All were expensive and until the 1930s none was \\"fast\\" enough for hand-held snapshot-taking, so they mostly served a niche market of affluent advanced amateurs.\\r\\nA new era in color photography began with the introduction of Kodachrome film, available for 16?mm home movies in 1935 and 35?mm slides in 1936. It captured the red, green, and blue color components in three layers of emulsion. A complex processing operation produced complementary cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images in those layers, resulting in a subtractive color image. Maxwell's method of taking three separate filtered black-and-white photographs continued to serve special purposes into the 1950s and beyond, and Polachrome, an \\"instant\\" slide film that used the Autochrome's additive principle, was available until 2003, but the few color print and slide films still being made in 2015 all use the multilayer emulsion approach pioneered by Kodachrome.\\r\\nIn 1957, a team led by Russell A. Kirsch at the National Institute of Standards and Technology developed a binary digital version of an existing technology, the wirephoto drum scanner, so that alphanumeric characters, diagrams, photographs and other graphics could be transferred into digital computer memory. One of the first photographs scanned was a picture of Kirsch's infant son Walden. The resolution was 176x176 pixels with only one bit per pixel, i.e., stark black and white with no intermediate gray tones, but by combining multiple scans of the photograph done with different black-white threshold settings, grayscale information could also be acquired.[47]\\r\\nThe charge-coupled device (CCD) is the image-capturing optoelectronic component in first-generation digital cameras. It was invented in 1969 by Willard Boyle and George E. Smith at AT&T Bell Labs as a memory device. The lab was working on the Picturephone and on the development of semiconductor bubble memory. Merging these two initiatives, Boyle and Smith conceived of the design of what they termed \\"Charge 'Bubble' Devices\\". The essence of the design was the ability to transfer charge along the surface of a semiconductor. It was Dr. Michael Tompsett from Bell Labs however, who discovered that the CCD could be used as an imaging sensor. The CCD has increasingly been replaced by the active pixel sensor (APS), commonly used in cell phone cameras. These mobile phone cameras are used by billions of people worldwide, dramatically increasing photographic activity and material and also fueling citizen journalism.\\r\\nThe web has been a popular medium for storing and sharing photos ever since the first photograph was published on the web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992 (an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes). Today sites and apps such as Flickr, Picasa, Instagram, Imgur and PhotoBucket are used by many millions of people to share their pictures.","input":"When was the first black and white photo taken?"},{"output":"6 February 1952","context":"Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926)[a] has been Queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand since 6 February 1952.

Her father acceded to the throne on the abdication of his brother Edward VIII in 1936, from which time she was the heir presumptive. She began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Andrew, Duke of York; and Edward, Earl of Wessex.\\r\\nElizabeth's many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland and visits to or from five popes. She has seen major constitutional changes, such as devolution in the United Kingdom, Canadian patriation, and the decolonisation of Africa. She has reigned through various wars and conflicts involving many of her realms. Significant events have included her coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, Golden, and Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012 respectively. In 2017, she became the first British monarch to reach a Sapphire Jubilee. She is the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch as well as the world's longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state, the oldest and longest-reigning current monarch and the oldest and longest-serving current head of state.\\r\\nElizabeth has occasionally faced republican sentiments and press criticism of the royal family, in particular after the breakdown of her children's marriages and the Windsor Castle fire in 1992 (her annus horribilis) and the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana, Princess of Wales; however, support for the monarchy remains high, as does her personal popularity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was born at 02:40 (GMT) on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. Her father, the Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son of the King. Her mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother), was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. She was delivered by Caesarean section at her maternal grandfather's London house: 17 Bruton Street, Mayfair.[2] She was baptised by the Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May,[3][c] and named Elizabeth after her mother, Alexandra after George V's mother, who had died six months earlier, and Mary after her paternal grandmother.[5] Called \\"Lilibet\\" by her close family,[6] based on what she called herself at first,[7] she was cherished by her grandfather George V, and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.[8]\\r\\nElizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their governess, Marion Crawford.[9] Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature and music.[10] Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled The Little Princesses in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family.[11] The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility.[12] Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was two as \\"a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant.\\"[13] Her cousin Margaret Rhodes described her as \\"a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved\\".[14]\\r\\nDuring her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father, the Duke of York. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young. Many people believed that he would marry and have children of his own.[15] When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis.[16] Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became heir presumptive. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her brother would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession.[17]\\r\\nElizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from Henry Marten, Vice-Provost of Eton College,[18] and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses.[19] A Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace Company, was formed specifically so that she could socialise with girls her own age.[20] Later, she was enrolled as a Sea Ranger.[19]\\r\\nIn 1939, Elizabeth's parents toured Canada and the United States. As in 1927, when her parents had toured Australia and New Zealand, Elizabeth remained in Britain, since her father thought her too young to undertake public tours.[21] Elizabeth \\"looked tearful\\" as her parents departed.[22] They corresponded regularly,[22] and she and her parents made the first royal transatlantic telephone call on 18 May.[21]\\r\\nIn September 1939, Britain entered the Second World War, which lasted until 1945. During the war, many of London's children were evacuated to avoid the frequent aerial bombing. The suggestion by senior politician Lord Hailsham[23] that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, \\"The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave.\\"[24] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk.[25] From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived for most of the next five years.[26] At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments.[27] In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities.[28] She stated: \\"We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.\\"[28]\\r\\nIn 1943, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the Grenadier Guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year.[29] As she approached her 18th birthday, parliament changed the law so that she could act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.[30] In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number of 230873.[31] She trained as a driver and mechanic and was given the rank of honorary junior commander five months later.[32][33]\\r\\nAt the end of the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled anonymously with the celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, \\"We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised?... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.\\"[34]\\r\\nDuring the war, plans were drawn up to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, at a time when Britain was at war.[35] Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.[36] In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.[37]\\r\\nPrincess Elizabeth went in 1947 on her first overseas tour, accompanying her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the British Commonwealth on her 21st birthday, she made the following pledge: \\"I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.\\"[38]\\r\\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, in 1934 and 1937.[39] They are second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third cousins through Queen Victoria. After another meeting at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in July 1939, Elizabeth ÿ though only 13 years old ÿ said she fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters.[40] She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.[41]\\r\\nThe engagement was not without controversy; Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links.[42] Marion Crawford wrote, \\"Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin.\\"[43] Later biographies reported that Elizabeth's mother initially opposed the union, dubbing Philip \\"The Hun\\".[44] In later life, however, the Queen Mother told biographer Tim Heald that Philip was \\"an English gentleman\\".[45]\\r\\nBefore the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, officially converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Anglicanism, and adopted the style Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, taking the surname of his mother's British family.[46] Just before the wedding, he was created Duke of Edinburgh and granted the style His Royal Highness.[47]\\r\\nElizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. They received 2500 wedding gifts from around the world.[48] Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war, Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown, which was designed by Norman Hartnell.[49] In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding.[50] The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.[51]\\r\\nElizabeth gave birth to her first child, Prince Charles, on 14 November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued letters patent allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince.[52] A second child, Princess Anne, was born in 1950.[53]\\r\\nFollowing their wedding, the couple leased Windlesham Moor, near Windsor Castle, until July 1949,[48] when they took up residence at Clarence House in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British Crown Colony of Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardaman?a, at Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten. The children remained in Britain.[54]\\r\\nDuring 1951, George VI's health declined and Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events. When she toured Canada and visited President Harry S. Truman in Washington, D.C., in October 1951, her private secretary, Martin Charteris, carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour.[55] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of Kenya. On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of the King and consequently Elizabeth's immediate accession to the throne. Philip broke the news to the new Queen.[56] Martin Charteris asked her to choose a regnal name; she chose to remain Elizabeth, \\"of course\\".[57] She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.[58] She and the Duke of Edinburgh moved into Buckingham Palace.[59]\\r\\nWith Elizabeth's accession, it seemed probable that the royal house would bear her husband's name, becoming the House of Mountbatten, in line with the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth's grandmother, Queen Mary, favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, \\"I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\\"[60] In 1960, after the death of Queen Mary in 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname Mountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.[61]\\r\\nAmid preparations for the coronation, Princess Margaret informed her sister that she wished to marry Peter Townsend, a divorc? 16 years Margaret's senior, with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of Martin Charteris, \\"the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought ÿ she hoped ÿ given time, the affair would peter out.\\"[62] Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage, she would have been expected to renounce her right of succession.[63] Eventually, she decided to abandon her plans with Townsend.[64] In 1960, she married Antony Armstrong-Jones, who was created Earl of Snowdon the following year. They divorced in 1978; she did not remarry.[65]\\r\\nDespite the death of Queen Mary on 24 March, the coronation on 2 June 1953 went ahead as planned, as Mary had asked before she died.[66] The ceremony in Westminster Abbey, with the exception of the anointing and communion, was televised for the first time.[67][d] Elizabeth's coronation gown was embroidered on her instructions with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries:[71] English Tudor rose; Scots thistle; Welsh leek; Irish shamrock; Australian wattle; Canadian maple leaf; New Zealand silver fern; South African protea; lotus flowers for India and Ceylon; and Pakistan's wheat, cotton, and jute.[72]\\r\\nFrom Elizabeth's birth onwards, the British Empire continued its transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations.[73] By the time of her accession in 1952, her role as head of multiple independent states was already established.[74] In 1953, the Queen and her husband embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour, visiting 13 countries and covering more than 40,000 miles by land, sea and air.[75] She became the first reigning monarch of Australia and New Zealand to visit those nations.[76] During the tour, crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen her.[77] Throughout her reign, the Queen has made hundreds of state visits to other countries and tours of the Commonwealth; she is the most widely travelled head of state.[78]\\r\\nIn 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union.[79] In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.[80]\\r\\nThe absence of a formal mechanism within the Conservative Party for choosing a leader meant that, following Eden's resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to commission to form a government. Eden recommended that she consult Lord Salisbury, the Lord President of the Council. Lord Salisbury and Lord Kilmuir, the Lord Chancellor, consulted the British Cabinet, Winston Churchill, and the Chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, resulting in the Queen appointing their recommended candidate: Harold Macmillan.[81]\\r\\nThe Suez crisis and the choice of Eden's successor led in 1957 to the first major personal criticism of the Queen. In a magazine, which he owned and edited,[82] Lord Altrincham accused her of being \\"out of touch\\".[83] Altrincham was denounced by public figures and slapped by a member of the public appalled by his comments.[84] Six years later, in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised the Queen to appoint the Earl of Home as prime minister, advice that she followed.[85] The Queen again came under criticism for appointing the prime minister on the advice of a small number of ministers or a single minister.[85] In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for electing a leader, thus relieving her of involvement.[86]\\r\\nIn 1957, she made a state visit to the United States, where she addressed the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of the Commonwealth. On the same tour, she opened the 23rd Canadian Parliament, becoming the first monarch of Canada to open a parliamentary session.[87] Two years later, solely in her capacity as Queen of Canada, she revisited the United States and toured Canada.[87][88] In 1961, she toured Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran.[89] On a visit to Ghana the same year, she dismissed fears for her safety, even though her host, President Kwame Nkrumah, who had replaced her as head of state, was a target for assassins.[90] Harold Macmillan wrote, \\"The Queen has been absolutely determined all through?... She is impatient of the attitude towards her to treat her as?... a film star?... She has indeed 'the heart and stomach of a man'?... She loves her duty and means to be a Queen.\\"[90] Before her tour through parts of Quebec in 1964, the press reported that extremists within the Quebec separatist movement were plotting Elizabeth's assassination.[91][92] No attempt was made, but a riot did break out while she was in Montreal; the Queen's \\"calmness and courage in the face of the violence\\" was noted.[93]\\r\\nElizabeth's pregnancies with Princes Andrew and Edward, in 1959 and 1963, mark the only times she has not performed the State Opening of the British parliament during her reign.[94] In addition to performing traditional ceremonies, she also instituted new practices. Her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970.[95]\\r\\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the decolonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. Over 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965, however, the Rhodesian Prime Minister, Ian Smith, in opposition to moves towards majority rule, declared unilateral independence from Britain while still expressing \\"loyalty and devotion\\" to Elizabeth. Although the Queen dismissed him in a formal declaration, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade.[96] As Britain's ties to its former empire weakened, the British government sought entry to the European Community, a goal it achieved in 1973.[97]\\r\\nIn February 1974, the British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, advised the Queen to call a general election in the middle of her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to Britain.[98] The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.[99]\\r\\nA year later, at the height of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals.[100] As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, stating that she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general.[101] The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.[100]\\r\\nIn 1977, Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth, many coinciding with her associated national and Commonwealth tours. The celebrations re-affirmed the Queen's popularity, despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret's separation from her husband.[102] In 1978, the Queen endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania's communist leader, Nicolae Ceau?escu, and his wife, Elena,[103] though privately she thought they had \\"blood on their hands\\".[104] The following year brought two blows: one was the unmasking of Anthony Blunt, former Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, as a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law Lord Mountbatten by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.[105]\\r\\nAccording to Paul Martin, Sr., by the end of the 1970s the Queen was worried that the Crown \\"had little meaning for\\" Pierre Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister.[106] Tony Benn said that the Queen found Trudeau \\"rather disappointing\\".[106] Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics, such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind the Queen's back in 1977, and the removal of various Canadian royal symbols during his term of office.[106] In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the patriation of the Canadian constitution found the Queen \\"better informed?... than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats\\".[106] She was particularly interested after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as head of state.[106] Patriation removed the role of the British parliament from the Canadian constitution, but the monarchy was retained. Trudeau said in his memoirs that the Queen favoured his attempt to reform the constitution and that he was impressed by \\"the grace she displayed in public\\" and \\"the wisdom she showed in private\\".[107]\\r\\nDuring the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, six weeks before the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down The Mall on her horse, Burmese. Police later discovered that the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three.[108] The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.[109]\\r\\nFrom April to September 1982, the Queen was anxious[110] but proud[111] of her son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War. On 9 July, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, Michael Fagan, in the room with her. In a serious lapse of security, assistance only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard.[112] After hosting US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, the Queen was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.[113]\\r\\nIntense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true.[114] As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \\"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not trueso long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\\"[115] Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \\"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of?... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.[116] Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party ÿ Thatcher's political opponents.[117] Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \\"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\\".[118] Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen,[119] and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift ÿ membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter ÿ to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major.[120] Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \\"behind the scenes force\\" in ending apartheid.[121][122]\\r\\nIn 1987, in Canada, Elizabeth publicly supported politically divisive constitutional amendments, prompting criticism from opponents of the proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau.[121] The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup. As monarch of Fiji, Elizabeth supported the attempts of the Governor-General, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic.[123] By the start of 1991, republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth ÿ which were contradicted by the Palace ÿ and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.[124] The involvement of younger members of the royal family in the charity game show It's a Royal Knockout was ridiculed,[125] and the Queen was the target of satire.[126]\\r\\nIn 1991, in the wake of coalition victory in the Gulf War, the Queen became the first British monarch to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress.[127]\\r\\nIn a speech on 24 November 1992, to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession, Elizabeth called 1992 her annus horribilis, meaning horrible year.[128] In March, her second son, Prince Andrew, and his wife, Sarah, separated; in April, her daughter, Princess Anne, divorced Captain Mark Phillips;[129] during a state visit to Germany in October, angry demonstrators in Dresden threw eggs at her;[130] and, in November, a large fire broke out at Windsor Castle, one of her official residences. The monarchy came under increased criticism and public scrutiny.[131] In an unusually personal speech, the Queen said that any institution must expect criticism, but suggested it be done with \\"a touch of humour, gentleness and understanding\\".[132] Two days later, the Prime Minister, John Major, announced reforms to the royal finances planned since the previous year, including the Queen paying income tax from 1993 onwards, and a reduction in the civil list.[133] In December, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, formally separated.[134] The year ended with a lawsuit as the Queen sued The Sun newspaper for breach of copyright when it published the text of her annual Christmas message two days before it was broadcast. The newspaper was forced to pay her legal fees and donated S200,000 to charity.[135]\\r\\nIn the years to follow, public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana's marriage continued.[136] Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher than at any time in living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings.[137] Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions.[138] In consultation with her husband and the Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.[139]\\r\\nIn August 1997, a year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. The Queen was on holiday with her extended family at Balmoral. Diana's two sons by Charles ÿ Princes William and Harry ÿ wanted to attend church and so the Queen and Prince Philip took them that morning.[140] After that single public appearance, for five days the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private,[141] but the royal family's seclusion and the failure to fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace caused public dismay.[122][142] Pressured by the hostile reaction, the Queen agreed to return to London and do a live television broadcast on 5 September, the day before Diana's funeral.[143] In the broadcast, she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings \\"as a grandmother\\" for the two princes.[144] As a result, much of the public hostility evaporated.[144]\\r\\nIn November 1997, the Queen and her husband held a reception at Banqueting House to mark their golden wedding anniversary.[145] She made a speech and praised Philip for his role as a consort, referring to him as \\"my strength and stay\\".[145]\\r\\nIn 2002, Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee. Her sister and mother died in February and March respectively, and the media speculated whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure.[146] She again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, which began in Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet \\"memorable\\" after a power cut plunged the King's House, the official residence of the governor-general, into darkness.[147] As in 1977, there were street parties and commemorative events, and monuments were named to honour the occasion. A million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London,[148] and the enthusiasm shown by the public for the Queen was greater than many journalists had expected.[149]\\r\\nThough generally healthy throughout her life, in 2003 she had keyhole surgery on both knees. In October 2006, she missed the opening of the new Emirates Stadium because of a strained back muscle that had been troubling her since the summer.[150]\\r\\nIn May 2007, The Daily Telegraph, citing unnamed sources, reported that the Queen was \\"exasperated and frustrated\\" by the policies of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, that she was concerned the British Armed Forces were overstretched in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair.[151] She was, however, said to admire Blair's efforts to achieve peace in Northern Ireland.[152] She became the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary in November 2007.[153] On 20 March 2008, at the Church of Ireland St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh, the Queen attended the first Maundy service held outside England and Wales.[154] At the invitation of the Irish President, Mary McAleese, the Queen made the first state visit to the Republic of Ireland by a British monarch in May 2011.[155]\\r\\nThe Queen addressed the United Nations for a second time in 2010, again in her capacity as Queen of all Commonwealth realms and Head of the Commonwealth.[156] The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, introduced her as \\"an anchor for our age\\".[157] During her visit to New York, which followed a tour of Canada, she officially opened a memorial garden for the British victims of the September 11 attacks.[157] The Queen's visit to Australia in October 2011 ÿ her sixteenth visit since 1954 ÿ was called her \\"farewell tour\\" in the press because of her age.[158]\\r\\nElizabeth's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 marked 60 years on the throne, and celebrations were held throughout her realms, the wider Commonwealth, and beyond. In a message released on Accession Day, Elizabeth wrote:\\r\\nShe and her husband undertook an extensive tour of the United Kingdom, while her children and grandchildren embarked on royal tours of other Commonwealth states on her behalf.[160][161] On 4 June, Jubilee beacons were lit around the world.[162] In November, the Queen and her husband celebrated their sapphire wedding anniversary.[163] On 18 December, she became the first British sovereign to attend a peacetime Cabinet meeting since George III in 1781.[164]\\r\\nThe Queen, who opened the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, also opened the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in London, making her the first head of state to open two Olympic Games in two different countries.[165] For the London Olympics, she played herself in a short film as part of the opening ceremony, alongside Daniel Craig as James Bond.[166] On 4 April 2013, she received an honorary BAFTA for her patronage of the film industry and was called \\"the most memorable Bond girl yet\\" at the award ceremony.[167]\\r\\nOn 3 March 2013, Elizabeth was admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital as a precaution after developing symptoms of gastroenteritis. She returned to Buckingham Palace the following day.[168] A week later, she signed the new Commonwealth charter.[169] Because of her age and the need for her to limit travelling, in 2013 she chose not to attend the biennial meeting of Commonwealth heads of government for the first time in 40 years. She was represented at the summit in Sri Lanka by her son, Prince Charles.[170]\\r\\nThe Queen surpassed her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-lived British monarch on 21 December 2007, and the longest-reigning British monarch and longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in the world on 9 September 2015.[171][172][173] She is also the \\"longest-reigning sovereign in Canada's modern era\\".[174] (King Louis XIV of France reigned over Canada (New France) for longer than Elizabeth.[175]) She became the oldest current monarch after King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia died on 23 January 2015.[176][177] She later became the longest-reigning current monarch and the longest-serving current head of state following the death of King Bhumibol of Thailand on 13 October 2016,[178][179] and the oldest current head of state on the resignation of Robert Mugabe on 21 November 2017.[180][181] On 6 February 2017, she became the first British monarch to commemorate a Sapphire Jubilee,[182] and on 20 November, she was the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary.[183] Prince Philip had retired from his official duties as the Queen's consort in August.[184]\\r\\nThe Queen does not intend to abdicate,[185] though Prince Charles is expected to take on more of her workload as Elizabeth, who celebrated her 91st birthday in 2017, carries out fewer public engagements.[186] Plans for her death and funeral have been extensively prepared by most British government and media organisations for decades.[187]\\r\\nSince Elizabeth rarely gives interviews, little is known of her personal feelings. As a constitutional monarch, she has not expressed her own political opinions in a public forum. She does have a deep sense of religious and civic duty, and takes her coronation oath seriously.[188] Aside from her official religious role as Supreme Governor of the established Church of England, she is personally a member of that church and the national Church of Scotland.[189] She has demonstrated support for inter-faith relations and has met with leaders of other churches and religions, including five popes: Pius XII, John XXIII, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis.[190] A personal note about her faith often features in her annual Christmas message broadcast to the Commonwealth.

Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public.[204] Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.[205]\\r\\nIn November 1999, a referendum in Australia on the future of the Australian monarchy favoured its retention in preference to an indirectly elected head of state.[206] Polls in Britain in 2006 and 2007 revealed strong support for Elizabeth,[207] and in 2012, her Diamond Jubilee year, approval ratings hit 90 percent.[208] Referenda in Tuvalu in 2008 and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2009 both rejected proposals to become republics.[209]\\r\\nElizabeth has been portrayed in a variety of media by many notable artists, including painters Pietro Annigoni, Peter Blake, Chinwe Chukwuogo-Roy, Terence Cuneo, Lucian Freud, Rolf Harris, Damien Hirst, Juliet Pannett, and Tai-Shan Schierenberg.[210][211] Notable photographers of Elizabeth have included Cecil Beaton, Yousuf Karsh, Annie Leibovitz, Lord Lichfield, Terry O'Neill, John Swannell, and Dorothy Wilding. The first official portrait of Elizabeth was taken by Marcus Adams in 1926.[212]\\r\\nElizabeth's personal fortune has been the subject of speculation for many years. In 1971 Jock Colville, who was her former private secretary and a director of her bank, Coutts, estimated her wealth at S2?million (equivalent to about S26?million in 2016[213]).[214][215] In 1993, Buckingham Palace called estimates of S100?million \\"grossly overstated\\".[216] In 2002, she inherited an estate worth an estimated S70?million from her mother.[217] The Sunday Times Rich List 2017 estimated her personal wealth at S360?million, making her the 329th richest person in the UK.[218]\\r\\nThe Royal Collection, which includes thousands of historic works of art and the Crown Jewels, is not owned by the Queen personally but is held in trust,[219] as are her official residences, such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,[220] and the Duchy of Lancaster, a property portfolio valued at S472?million in 2015.[221] Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle are personally owned by the Queen.[220] The British Crown Estate ÿ with holdings of S12?billion in 2016[218] ÿ is held in trust and cannot be sold or owned by Elizabeth in a personal capacity.[222]\\r\\nElizabeth has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders in her own countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms she has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Jamaica and her other realms and territories in Jamaica, Queen of Australia and her other realms and territories in Australia, etc. In the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies rather than separate realms, she is known as Duke of Normandy and Lord of Mann, respectively. Additional styles include Defender of the Faith and Duke of Lancaster. When in conversation with the Queen, the practice is to initially address her as Your Majesty and thereafter as Ma'am.[223]\\r\\nFrom 21 April 1944 until her accession, Elizabeth's arms consisted of a lozenge bearing the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose and the first and third a cross of St George.[224] Upon her accession, she inherited the various arms her father held as sovereign. The Queen also possesses royal standards and personal flags for use in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Barbados, and elsewhere.[225]","input":"When did the queen became queen of england?"},{"output":"thirteen","context":"The Hawaiian alphabet (in Hawaiian: ka pؐ?p Hawai?i) is an alphabet used to write Hawaiian. It was adapted from the English alphabet in the early 19th century by American missionaries to print a bible in the Hawaiian language.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1778, British explorer James Cook made the first reported Europe voyage to Hawai?i. In his report, he wrote the name of the islands as \\"Owhyhee\\" or \\"Owhyee\\". In 1822, a writing system based on one similar to the new New Zealand Grammar was developed and printed by American Protestant missionary Elisha Loomis.[1] The original alphabet included five vowels and twelve consonants:\\r\\nand seven diphthongs:\\r\\nIn addition, the letters F, G, S, Y, and Z were used to spell foreign words.\\r\\nIn 1826, the developers voted to eliminate some of the letters which represented functionally redundant interchangeable letters, enabling the Hawaiian alphabet to approach the ideal state of one-symbol-one-sound, and thereby optimizing the ease with which people could teach and learn the reading and writing of Hawaiian.[2][3]\\r\\nDue to words with different meanings being spelled alike, use of the glottal stop became necessary. As early as 1823, the missionaries made limited use of the apostrophe to represent the glottal stop, but they did not make it a letter of the alphabet. In publishing the Hawaiian Bible, they used the ?okina to distinguish ko?u ('my') from kou ('your'). It was not until 1864 that the ?okina became a recognized letter of the Hawaiian alphabet.[2]\\r\\nAs early as 1821, one of the missionaries, Hiram Bingham, was using macrons in making handwritten transcriptions of Hawaiian vowels. The macron, or kahak, was used to differentiate between short and long vowels.\\r\\nThe current official Hawaiian alphabet consists of thirteen letters: five vowels (Aa, Ee, Ii, Oo, Uu) and eight consonants (Hh, Kk, Ll, Mm, Nn, Pp, Ww, ?okina).[2] Alphabetic order differs from the normal Latin order in that the vowels come first, then the consonants.

It began in 1791 as one faction in Congress, and included many politicians who had been opposed to the new constitution. They called themselves Republicans after their ideology, Republicanism. They distrusted the Federalist commitment to republicanism. The party splintered in 1824 into the Jacksonian movement (which became the Democratic Party in 1828) and the short-lived National Republican Party (later succeeded by the Whig Party).\\r\\nThe term \\"Democratic-Republican\\" is used especially by modern political scientists for the first \\"Republican Party\\" (as opposed to the modern Republican Party founded in 1854). It is also known as the Jeffersonian Republicans. Historians typically use the title \\"Republican Party\\".\\r\\nAn \\"Anti-Administration\\" faction met secretly in the national capital (Philadelphia) to oppose Hamilton's financial programs. Jefferson denounced the programs as leading to monarchy and subversive of republicanism. Jefferson needed to have a nationwide party to challenge the Federalists, which Hamilton was building up with allies in major cities. Foreign affairs took a leading role in 1794ÿ95 as the Republicans vigorously opposed the Jay Treaty with Britain, which was then at war with France. Republicans saw France as more democratic after its revolution, while Britain represented the hated monarchy. The party denounced many of Hamilton's measures as unconstitutional, especially the national bank.\\r\\nThe party was strongest in the South and weakest in the Northeast. It demanded states' rights as expressed by the \\"Principles of 1798\\" articulated in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions that would allow states to nullify a federal law.[6] Above all, the party stood for the primacy of the yeoman farmers. Republicans were deeply committed to the principles of republicanism, which they feared were threatened by the supposed monarchical tendencies of the Hamiltonian Federalists. The party came to power in 1801 with the election of Jefferson in the 1800 presidential election. The Federaliststoo elitist to appeal to most peoplefaded away, and totally collapsed after 1815. The Republicans dominated the First Party System, despite internal divisions, until partisanship itself withered away during the Era of Good Feelings after 1816.\\r\\nThe party selected its presidential candidates in a caucus of members of Congress. They included Thomas Jefferson (nominated 1796; elected 1800ÿ01, 1804), James Madison (1808, 1812), and James Monroe (1816, 1820). By 1824, the caucus system had practically collapsed. After 1800, the party dominated Congress and most state governments outside New England. By 1824, the party was split four ways and lacked a center, as the First Party System collapsed. The emergence of the Second Party System in the 1830s realigned the old factions. One remnant followed Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren into the new Democratic Party by 1828. Another remnant led by John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay formed the National Republicans in 1828; it developed into the Whig Party by 1835.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCongressman James Madison started the party among Representatives in Philadelphia (then the national capital) as the \\"Republican Party\\";[8] then he, Jefferson, and others reached out to include state and local leaders around the country, especially New York and the South.[9] The precise date of founding is disputed, but 1791 is a reasonable estimate; some time by 1792 is certain. The new party set up newspapers that made withering critiques of Hamiltonianism, extolled the yeoman farmer, argued for strict construction of the Constitution, favored the French Revolution, strongly opposed Great Britain, and called for stronger state governments than the Federalist Party was proposing.[10]\\r\\nThe elections of 1792 were the first ones to be contested on anything resembling a partisan basis. In most states the congressional elections were recognized, as Jefferson strategist John Beckley put it, as a \\"struggle between the Treasury department and the republican interest\\". In New York, the candidates for governor were John Jay, a Federalist, and incumbent George Clinton, who was allied with Jefferson and the Republicans.[11] Four states' electors voted for Clinton and one (Kentucky) for Jefferson for Vice President in opposition to incumbent John Adams as well as casting their votes for President Washington. (Before 1804 electors cast two votes together without differentiation as to which office was to be filled by which candidate.)\\r\\nIn the 1796 election, the party made its first bid for the presidency with Jefferson as its presidential candidate and Aaron Burr as its vice presidential candidate. Jefferson came in second in the electoral college (at the time, its balloting could not distinguish between president and vice president) and became vice president. He would become a consistent and strong opponent of the policies of the John Adams administration. Jefferson and Madison were deeply upset by the unconstitutionality of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798; they secretly wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which called on state legislatures to nullify unconstitutional laws. The other states, however, did not follow suit and several rejected the notion that states could nullify federal law. The Republican critique of federalism became wrapped in the slogan of \\"Principles of 1798\\", which became the hallmark of the party. The most important of these principles were states' rights, opposition to a strong national government, distrust of the federal courts, and opposition to the navy and the national bank. The party saw itself as a champion of republicanism and denounced the Federalists as supporters of monarchy and aristocracy.[12]\\r\\nThe party coalesced around Jefferson, who diligently maintained extensive correspondence with like-minded Republican leaders throughout the country. Washington frequently decried the growing sense of \\"party\\" emerging from the internal battles among Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, Adams and others in his administration. As warfare in Europe increased, the two factions increasingly made foreign policy the central political issue of the day. The Republicans wanted to maintain the 1777 alliance with France, which had overthrown the monarchy and aristocracy and become a republic. Even though Britain was by far America's leading trading partner, Republicans feared that increased trade would undermine republicanism. The Republicans distrusted Hamilton's national bank and rejected his premise that a national debt was good for the country; Republicans said they were both forms of corruption. They strongly distrusted the elitism of Hamilton's circle, denouncing it as \\"aristocratic\\"; and they called for states' rights lest the Federalists centralize ever more power in the national governments.[13]\\r\\nThe intense debate over the Jay Treaty in 1794ÿ95, transformed those opposed to Hamilton's policies from a loose movement into a true political party. To fight the treaty, the Jeffersonians \\"established coordination in activity between leaders at the capital, and leaders, actives and popular followings in the states, counties and towns.\\"[14] However, they were defeated when Washington mobilized public opinion in favor of the treaty.\\r\\nHistorians have used statistical techniques to estimate the party breakdown in Congress. Many Congressmen were hard to classify in the first few years, but after 1796 there was less uncertainty.\\r\\nThe affiliation of many Congressmen in the earliest years is an assignment by later historians; these were slowly coalescing groups with initially considerable independent thinking and voting; Cunningham noted that only about a quarter of the House of Representatives, up till 1794, voted with Madison as much as two-thirds of the time, and another quarter against him two-thirds of the time, leaving almost half as fairly independent. Albert Gallatin recalled only two caucuses on legislative policy between 1795 and 1801, one over appropriations for Jay's Treaty, the other over the Quasi-War, and in neither case did the party decide to vote unanimously.[16]\\r\\nThe new party invented some of the campaign and organizational techniques which were later adopted by the Federalists and became standard American practice. It was especially effective in building a network of newspapers in major cities to broadcast its statements and editorialize its policies.[17] Fisher Ames, a leading Federalist, used the term \\"Jacobin\\" to link members of Jefferson's party to the radicals of the French Revolution. He blamed the newspapers for electing Jefferson; they were, he wrote, \\"an overmatch for any Government.... The Jacobins owe their triumph to the unceasing use of this engine; not so much to skill in use of it as by repetition.\\"[18]\\r\\nAs one historian explained, \\"It was the good fortune of the Republicans to have within their ranks a number of highly gifted political manipulators and propagandists. Some of them had the ability... to not only see and analyze the problem at hand but to present it in a succinct fashion; in short, to fabricate the apt phrase, to coin the compelling slogan and appeal to the electorate on any given issue in language it could understand.\\" Outstanding propagandists included editor William Duane (1760ÿ1835), and party leaders Albert Gallatin, Thomas Cooper and Jefferson himself.[19]\\r\\nJust as important was effective party organization of the sort that John J. Beckley pioneered. In 1796, he managed the Jefferson campaign in Pennsylvania, blanketing the state with agents who passed out 30,000 hand-written tickets, naming all 15 electors (printed tickets were not allowed). He told one agent, \\"In a few days a select republican friend from the City will call upon you with a parcel of tickets to be distributed in your County. Any assistance and advice you can furnish him with, as to suitable districts & characters, will I am sure be rendered.\\" Beckley was the first American professional campaign manager, and his techniques were quickly adopted in other states.[20]\\r\\nThe emergence of the new organizational strategies can be seen in the politics of Connecticut around 1806, which have been well documented by Cunningham. The Federalists dominated Connecticut, so the Republicans had to work harder to win. In 1806, the state leadership sent town leaders instructions for the forthcoming elections. Every town manager was told by state leaders \\"to appoint a district manager in each district or section of his town, obtaining from each an assurance that he will faithfully do his duty.\\" Then the town manager was instructed to compile lists and total the number of taxpayers and the number of eligible voters, find out how many favored the Republicans and how many the Federalists, and to count the number of supporters of each party who were not eligible to vote but who might qualify (by age or taxes) at the next election. These highly detailed returns were to be sent to the county manager and in turn were compiled and sent to the state manager. Using these lists of potential voters, the managers were told to get all eligible people to town meetings and help the young men qualify to vote. The state manager was responsible for supplying party newspapers to each town for distribution by town and district managers.[21] This highly coordinated \\"get-out-the-vote\\" drive would be familiar to modern political campaigners, but was the first of its kind in world history.\\r\\nThe party's electors secured a majority in the 1800 election, but an equal number of electors cast votes for Jefferson and Aaron Burr. The tie sent the election to the House, and Federalists there blocked any choice. Finally Hamilton, believing that Burr would be a poor choice for president, intervened, letting Jefferson win (a move that would result in the collapse of the Federalist Party and Hamilton's death, four years later, at the hands of Burr in a pistol duel). Starting in 1800 in what Jefferson called the \\"Revolution of 1800\\", the party took control of the presidency and both houses of Congress, beginning a quarter century of control of those institutions. A faction called \\"Old Republicans\\" opposed the nationalism that grew popular after 1815; they were stunned when party leaders started a Second Bank of the United States in 1816.\\r\\nThe first official Republican Congressional Caucus meeting took place at Marache's boarding house on May 11, 1800, in Philadelphia. The January 26, 1799 letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to Elbridge Gerry became the party's platform.\\r\\nIn the Senate chamber on February 25, 1804, a \\"Convention of Republican members of both houses of Congress\\" met. Senator Stephen Bradley presided, a Committee on Presidential Electors was formed and it was resolved that Thomas Jefferson be nominated for President and George Clinton be nominated Vice President.\\r\\nThe party held a convention by the same name on January 23, 1808, again in the Senate chamber at 6:00 pm on a Saturday. Senator Stephen Bradley, who was the President pro tempore of the Senate, again served as President of the convention with Representative Richard Johnson as the Secretary. A Committee on Correspondence was formed, James Madison was nominated for President, and George Clinton was re-nominated for Vice President.\\r\\nLegislative issues were handled by the Committee of the Whole, and the elected Speaker of the House of Representatives and floor leaders, who at that time were the Chairman for the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and Chairman for the Committee on Finance of the Senate.\\r\\nThe state legislatures often instructed Members of Congress how to vote on specific issues. More exactly, they \\"instructed\\" the Senators (who were elected by the legislatures), and \\"requested\\" the Representatives (who were elected by the people.) On rare occasions a Senator resigned rather than follow instructions.\\r\\nThe opposition Federalist Party, suffering from a lack of leadership after the death of Hamilton and the retirement of John Adams, quickly declined; it revived briefly in opposition to the War of 1812, but the extremism of its Hartford Convention of 1815 utterly destroyed it as a political force.\\r\\nJefferson and Albert Gallatin focused on the danger that the public debt, unless it was paid off, would be a threat to republican values. They were appalled that Hamilton was increasing the national debt and using it to solidify his Federalist base. Gallatin was the Republican Party's chief expert on fiscal issues and as Treasury Secretary under Jefferson and Madison worked hard to lower taxes and lower the debt, while at the same time paying cash for the Louisiana Purchase and funding the War of 1812. Burrows says of Gallatin:\\r\\nHis own fears of personal dependency and his small shopkeeper's sense of integrity, both reinforced by a strain of radical republican thought that originated in England a century earlier, convinced him that public debts were a nursery of multiple public evilscorruption, legislative impotence, executive tyranny, social inequality, financial speculation, and personal indolence. Not only was it necessary to extinguish the existing debt as rapidly as possible, he argued, but Congress would have to ensure against the accumulation of future debts by more diligently supervising government expenditures.[22]\\r\\nFear of a large debt is a major legacy of the party. Andrew Jackson believed the national debt was a \\"national curse\\" and he took special pride in paying off the entire national debt in 1835.[23] Politicians ever since have used the issue of a high national debt to denounce the other party for profligacy and a threat to fiscal soundness and the nation's future.[24]\\r\\nIn rapidly expanding western states, the Federalists had few supporters. Every state had a distinct political geography that shaped party membership. In Pennsylvania, the Republicans were weakest around Philadelphia and strongest in Scots-Irish settlements in the west. Members came from all social classes, but came predominantly from the poor, subsistence farmers, mechanics and tradesmen.[25] After the War of 1812, partisanship subsided across the young republicpeople called it the Era of Good Feelings. James Monroe narrowly won the party's nomination for President in Congress over William Crawford in 1816 and defeated Federalist Rufus King in the general election.\\r\\nIn the early years of the party, the key central organization grew out of caucuses of Congressional leaders in Washington. However, the key battles to choose electors occurred in the states, not in the caucus. In many cases, legislatures still chose electors; in others, the election of electors was heavily influenced by local parties that were heavily controlled by relatively small groups of officials. Without a significant Federalist opposition, the need for party unity was greatly diminished and the party's organization faded away.\\r\\nJames Monroe ran under the party's banner in the 1820 election and built support by consensus. Monroe faced no serious rival and was nearly unanimously elected by the electoral college. The party's historic domination by the Virginian delegation faded as New York and Pennsylvania became more important. In the 1824 election, most of the party in Congress boycotted the caucus; only a small rump group backed William Crawford. The Crawford faction included most \\"Old Republicans\\"those who remained committed to states' rights and the Principles of 1798 and were distrustful of the nationalizing program promoted by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun.\\r\\nThomas Jefferson wrote on the state of party politics in the early 1820s:[26]\\r\\nAn opinion prevails that there is no longer any distinction, that the republicans & Federalists are completely amalgamated but it is not so. The amalgamation is of name only, not of principle. All indeed call themselves by the name of Republicans, because that of Federalists was extinguished in the battle of New Orleans. But the truth is that finding that monarchy is a desperate wish in this country, they rally to the point which they think next best, a consolidated government. Their aim is now therefore to break down the rights reserved by the constitution to the states as a bulwark against that consolidation, the fear of which produced the whole of the opposition to the constitution at its birth. Hence new Republicans in Congress, preaching the doctrines of the old Federalists, and the new nick-names of Ultras and Radicals. But I trust they will fail under the new, as the old name, and that the friends of the real constitution and union will prevail against consolidation, as they have done against monarchism. I scarcely know myself which is most to be deprecated, a consolidation, or dissolution of the states. The horrors of both are beyond the reach of human foresight.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the disputed 1824 presidential election, the separate factions took on many characteristics of parties in their own right. Adams' supporters, in league with Clay, favored modernization, banks, industrial development, and federal spending for roads and other internal improvements, which the Old Republicans and the Jackson men usually opposed. Writing in his personal journal on December 13, 1826, President Adams noted the difficulty he faced in attempting to be nonpartisan in appointing men to office:[27]\\r\\nAnd it is upon the occasion of appointments to office that all the wormwood and the gall of the old party hatred ooze out. Not a vacancy to any office occurs but there is a distinguished federalist started and pushed home as a candidate to fill italways well qualified, sometimes in an eminent degree, and yet so obnoxious to the Republican party that he cannot be appointed without exciting a vehement clamor against him and against the Administration. It becomes thus impossible to fill any appointment without offending one-half the communitythe federalists, if their associate is overlooked; the Republicans, if he is preferred.\\r\\nPresidential electors were now all chosen by direct election, except in South Carolina, where the state legislatures chose them. White manhood suffrage was the norm throughout the West and in most of the East as well. The voters thus were much more powerful, and to win their votes required complex party organization. Under the leadership of Martin Van Buren, a firm believer in political organization, the Jacksonians built strong state and local organizations throughout the country. The Old Republicans, or \\"Radicals\\", mostly supported Jackson and joined with supporters of incumbent Vice President Calhoun in an alliance. President Adams was defeated by Andrew Jackson in the election of 1828.\\r\\nPolitical parties were new in the United States, and people were not accustomed to having formal names for them. There was no single, official name for the party. Party members generally called themselves Republicans and voted for what they called the Republican Party, republican ticket, or republican interest.[28] Jefferson and Madison often used the terms \\"republican\\" and \\"Republican party\\" in their letters.[29] The 1804 Convention of Republican members of Congress that renominated Jefferson described itself as a \\"regular republican caucus\\". The name Democratic-Republican was used by contemporaries only occasionally.[30]\\r\\nThe term \\"republican\\" was in widespread usage from the 1770s to describe the type of government the break-away colonies wanted to form: a republic of three separate branches of government derived from some principles and structure from ancient republics; especially the emphasis on civic duty and the opposition to corruption, elitism, aristocracy and monarchy.[31] The word is used in the U.S. Constitution.[32]\\r\\nA split appeared in the then Republican party during the 1824 elections (at the end of the Monroe administration). When the election was thrown to the House of Representatives, Henry Clay backed John Quincy Adams to deny the presidency to Andrew Jackson, a longtime political rival. Jackson defeated Adams in 1828, and in the next election, the first Democratic national convention took place in Baltimore, Maryland on May 21ÿ23, 1832. It nominated Andrew Jackson for a second term, and he went on to win the presidential election.\\r\\nThe Adams/Clay alliance became the basis of the National Republican Party, a rival to the Jackson's Democracy and one of the successors of the Democratic-Republican Party. This party favored a higher tariff in order to protect U.S. manufacturers, as well as public works, especially roads. Many former members of the defunct Federalist Party, including Daniel Webster, joined the party. After Clay's defeat by Jackson in the 1832 presidential election, the National Republicans were absorbed into the Whig Party, a diverse group of Jackson opponents. Taking a leaf from the Jacksonians, the Whigs tended to nominate non-ideological war heroes as their presidential candidates. The Whig party fell apart in the 1850s over the question of whether to allow the expansion of slavery into new territories.\\r\\nThe modern Republican Party was formed in 1854 to oppose the expansion of slavery.

In that year, she stated, \\"Sophia is written as a multi-dimensional character who the audience can really empathize withall of the sudden they're empathizing with a real Trans person. And for Trans folks out there, who need to see representations of people who are like them and of their experiences, that's when it becomes really important.\\"[31] Cox's role in Orange Is the New Black provides her a platform to speak on the rights of trans people.\\r\\nIn January 2014, Cox joined trans woman Carmen Carrera on Katie Couric's syndicated show, Katie. Couric referred to transgender people as \\"transgenders\\", and after being rebuffed by Carrera on the subject of her surgeries, specifically what genital reconstruction she had done, turned the same question to Cox. Cox responded,\\r\\nI do feel there is a preoccupation with that. The preoccupation with transition and surgery objectifies trans people. And then we don't get to really deal with the real lived experiences. The reality of trans people's lives is that so often we are targets of violence. We experience discrimination disproportionately to the rest of the community. Our unemployment rate is twice the national average; if you are a trans person of color, that rate is four times the national average. The homicide rate is highest among trans women. If we focus on transition, we don't actually get to talk about those things.[32]\\r\\nNews outlets such as Salon, The Huffington Post, and Business Insider covered what was characterized by Salon writer Katie McDonough as Couric's \\"clueless\\" and \\"invasive\\" line of questioning.[33]\\r\\nCox was on the cover of the June 9, 2014, issue of Time, and was interviewed for the article \\"The Transgender Tipping Point\\" by Katy Steinmetz, which ran in that issue and the title of which was also featured on the cover; this makes Cox the first openly transgender person on the cover of Time.[12][34][35]\\r\\nLater in 2014, Cox became the first openly transgender person to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in an acting category: Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Sophia Burset in Orange Is the New Black.[6][36][37]\\r\\nAlso in 2014, Cox appeared in John Legend's video for the song \\"You & I (Nobody in the World)\\".[38]\\r\\nCox also joined a campaign that year against a Phoenix, Arizona law which allows police to arrest anyone suspected of \\"manifesting prostitution\\", and which she feels targets transgender women of color, following the conviction of activist (and transgender woman of color) Monica Jones.[39] Cox stated, \\"\\"All over the country, trans women are targeted simply for being who they are. Laws like this manifestation law really support systematically the idea that girls like me, girls like me and Monica, are less than [others] in this country,\\"[39] Later that year the Sylvia Rivera Law Project released a video in which Cox read a letter from transgender inmate Synthia China Blast, addressing common issues faced by trans inmates.[40] But when Cox learned that Blast was found guilty of the 1993 rape and murder of 13-year-old Ebony Williams, she wrote on her Tumblr, \\"I was not aware of the charges for which she was convicted. If I had been aware of those charges, I would have never agreed to read the letter.\\"[40]\\r\\nCox was featured in the annual \\"Rebels\\" issue of V in late 2014.[41] For the issue, V asked celebrities and artists to nominate who they saw as their personal rebels, and Natasha Lyonne nominated Cox.[41] Cox was also on the cover of the October 2014 issue of Essence magazine, along with actresses Alfre Woodard, Nicole Beharie, and Danai Gurira.[42]\\r\\nOn October 17, 2014, Laverne Cox Presents: The T Word, an hour-long documentary executive-produced and narrated by Cox, premiered on MTV and Logo simultaneously.[43]\\r\\nAlso in 2014, Cox was featured on the fifth anniversary cover of CNDY magazine along with 13 other transgender women ÿ Janet Mock, Carmen Carrera, Geena Rocero, Isis King, Gisele Alicea, Leyna Ramous, Dina Marie, Nina Poon, Juliana Huxtable, Niki M'nray, Pche Di, Carmen Xtravaganza (House of Xtravaganza), and Yasmine Petty.[44]\\r\\nIn 2015, Cox won a Daytime Emmy Award in Outstanding Special Class Special as Executive Producer for Laverne Cox Presents: The T Word.[7][8] This made Cox the first openly transgender woman to win a Daytime Emmy as an Executive Producer; as well, The T Word is the first trans documentary to win a Daytime Emmy.[7]\\r\\nAlso in 2015, Cox (among others) posed nude for the Allure annual \\"Nudes\\" issue, becoming the first openly transgender actress to do so.[45]\\r\\nCox is the cover subject for the June 11, 2015 \\"totally not-straight issue\\" of Entertainment Weekly, the first issue of the magazine in 15 years to focus exclusively on gay, lesbian, and transgender entertainment.[46]\\r\\nIn June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the 2016 Orlando gay nightclub shooting; in the video, Cox and others told the stories of the people killed there.[47][48]\\r\\nIn 2017, Cox began her role as transgender attorney Cameron Wirth on Doubt on CBS.[10] However, after only two episodes had aired, CBS announced that they were pulling the series from their schedule, leaving the future of the remaining unaired episodes uncertain.[49] It was the first official cancellation of the 2016ÿ17 season, following weak viewership.

A Madea Halloween, Geostorm, and Only The Brave, and was expected to gross around $10 million from 1,813 theaters in its opening weekend.[20] However after making just $1.3 million on its first day (including $270,000 from Thursday night previews), weekend predictions were lowered to $4 million. It went on to debut to just $3.2 million, finishing 8th at the box office.[21] In its second weekend the film dropped 64% to $1.2 million, falling to 17th place at the box office.[22] The film was then pulled from 1,291 theaters in its third week and fell 86% to $167,685, finishing 33rd.[23]\\r\\nThe Snowman received negative reviews from critics, who decried the film's scattered and incomprehensible plot line and bemoaned the lack of direction for its main cast members.[24] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 8% based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 3.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"A mystery that feels as mashed together and perishable as its title, The Snowman squanders its bestselling source material as well as a top-notch ensemble cast.\\"[25] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 23 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".[26] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"D\\" on an A+ to F scale.[21]\\r\\nJustin Chang of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, writing \\"There's probably a good movie or several buried in the frigid wilds of Nesb?'s fiction, and with more time and cultural nuance and fewer cooks in the kitchen, it might well be realized.

This character was designed to look like Samuel L. Jackson, the actor who later went on to portray Nick Fury in several Marvel movies and television shows set in the established Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Nick Fury first made his appearance in the Ultimate Universe, he had a vastly different design, resembling more the original mainstream version with notable differences, featuring a full head of close-cropped hair, a clean-shaven, younger appearance (particularly as depicted in Ultimate Marvel Team-Up) and less visible scarring around his eye-patch, not to mention lacking a specific resemblance to any actor. He wore seemingly normal clothing which integrated outlandishly high-tech capabilities such as phasing, invisibility, and \\"para-shoes\\" that allow him to descend hundreds of feet without the aid of a parachute (shown to be capable of flight in later issues).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the character resurfaced in 2002 in The Ultimates, he had been redesigned to look like actor Samuel L. Jackson.[4] and first appeared with this revised look in The Ultimates #1, as drawn by Bryan Hitch. The similarity is even noted within the comic itself, in a scene in which the Ultimates discuss who they think should play each of them in a hypothetical movie about the team. Fury's answer for himself is \\"Mr. Samuel L. Jackson, of course, no discussion.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Mighty Avengers #13, Nick Fury (of the Earth-616 universe) uses a disguise that is similar in appearance to Ultimate Fury. This receives comment from Daisy Johnson as \\"his worst disguise ever.\\" Conversely, in Ultimate Mystery, it is the Ultimate version of the character who disguises himself, resembling his Earth-616 counterpart and gets the same comment. In the mainstream event of Battle Scars, it is revealed that the 616 Fury fathered a child with an African-American woman named Nia Jones. His child went under the alias \\"Marcus Johnson\\", but his real name is Nick Fury, Jr.. Fury Jr. closely resembles the Ultimate version of Fury.[5] When the original Nick Fury decided to retire as director of S.H.I.E.L.D., the mantle was handed onto Fury Jr., who had recently lost his left eye and took to wearing an eye patch. \\r\\n\\r\\nNicholas Fury fought for the United States in World War II. During the invasion of Sicily, he, along with Private Fisk and Canadian paratrooper Corporal Howlett, attempted to loot a house. American military police arrived to arrest them, and all three were subdued. Fisk was grazed by a bullet, while Fury was imprisoned in an unknown location alongside several other black men, and Howlett, despite protests that he was Canadian, was also shipped to an unknown location.[6] Fury was selected to be the next test subject for Project: Rebirth, as his blood work most closely matched that of Subject #22, the most successful of the previous test subjects. He was injected with a serum that gave him super-strength, which he used to free himself and the other prisoners, who then escaped. The scientists who were working on him let him escape, deciding that they have all the information that they needed for now.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter attending college in India, Fury enlisted in the U.S. military, where he was deployed into various conflicts such as the Kosovo War. He was later assigned to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Weapon X program in the original Gulf War. While transporting Wolverine in his adamantium cage, an Iraqi guerrilla ambushed and killed his team, inadvertently freeing Wolverine from his prison. After slaughtering the Iraqi guards, Wolverine discovered Fury, the only survivor of the ambush, and transported him back through the desert to the Allied forces. Although Wolverine was summarily subdued and re-imprisoned by his handlers, a bond between the two men was formed.[8] The next day, Fury, already mostly healed, was confronted by General Thaddeus Ross. The General had discovered much was unusual about Fury and questioned him at length, prompting him to reexamine where he was going in life.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nYears later, the X-Men were abducted and imprisoned by the Weapon X program. This program was overseen at the time by Wraith, who had previously staged a coup against General Ross. This coup had prevented Ross from dismantling the Weapon X program altogether. Wolverine, the only X-Man who eludes capture, later asks Fury for help in freeing the other X-Men and bringing down the Weapon X program. During the operation, which also involves the Brotherhood of Mutants, Wraith was about to kill Nightcrawler, but was shot dead by Fury.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nFury is summarily promoted to General and resumes the duties of the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. He was tasked with forming a team to battle posthuman threats and resurrecting the Super-Soldier program, two objectives that resulted in the formation of the Ultimates. Fury operates as the commander of the team, at times leading them into action, though he often shares duties with the revived World War II hero, Captain America. Nick Fury is also responsible for monitoring posthumans who are not affiliated with the U.S. Military, including Peter Parker and the X-Men.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nNick Fury lost his right arm in a battle against the Liberators in The Ultimates (Vol. 2). He replaced it shortly thereafter with a bionic one.\\r\\n\\r\\nNick Fury has also been involved in the Ultimate Spider-Man comics. In them, he meets Peter after Norman Osborn returns. He states that S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to figure out who Peter was because of the security shots of the OG Spider biting Peter, as well as Dr. Octopus screaming that Peter Parker is Spider-Man while in jail. Nick Fury has been watching Peter and informs him that, due to his illegal genetically altered status, he will become the property of S.H.I.E.L.D. when he turns eighteen. Although Fury wants him to be part of the Ultimates, this may have changed because the Ultimates broke apart. Peter and Fury's relationship became strained after the Hobgoblin arc. Peter punches Fury for ignoring his questions for why Harry became the Hobgoblin. At that point, Fury told one of his scientists that he wanted to know everything about OZ and that it was time for Peter Parker to lose his spider powers. This follows on to the Ultimate Clone Saga, in which it is revealed by Fury that the Tinkerer's Spider-Slayers were developed to handle Peter if and when he ever went insane. Mary Jane Watson, upon discovering Fury's intentions, tells him that Peter looks up to him like a father. This convinced Fury to let Peter keep his powers, and he apologises to Peter, stating that in his line of work he's been trained to expect someone in Peter's position to crack under stress.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nFury was judged to be at least partially responsible for the devastation of much of Earth-31916 along with Emil Burbank. Burbank had sought a means to defeat the Hyperion of that universe. An alien organism, unleashed in an attempt to achieve this, spread throughout the United States, causing widespread devastation. A probe sent by Reed Richards provided evidence that an \\"invasion from another universe\\" was responsible. The Squadron Supreme was dispatched to the Ultimate Universe in order to arrest Richards so that he could stand trial for his \\"crimes\\". A lengthy battle ensued between the Squadron on one side and the Ultimates, Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four on the other. Richards, believing himself to be responsible when the Squadron produced his probe as evidence, surrendered himself. Fury was unwilling to accept this and convinced Thor to create a bridge to Earth-31916, through which the Helicarrier was able to travel. Once there, another battle between the Squadron and the Ultimate Universe heroes began. Spider-Man learns that Fury had an ulterior motive - the retrieval of the probes and their data, and had conspired with Doctor Doom to do so. In addition, Fury had brought insurance in the form of the Hulk. It took the combined power of the Ultimate Universe heroes, the Earth-31916 Squadron Supreme, and their counterparts from Earth-712 to defeat the Hulk, but Doom had proven to be simply a Doombot. To stop the fighting, the Ultimates agreed to turn over Fury to the Earth-31916 Squadron and to allow Power Princess to return with them to their universe. Fury tries to convince them that they are making a mistake, but his pleas are ignored.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFury is seen still stranded in Earth-31916 in Squadron Supreme (Vol. 2) #1. He has apparently fulfilled the prophecy made by Hyperion in Ultimate Power #9: \\"Given the strength of our military industrial complex, Fury would have risen here to even greater heights than your homeworld.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nFury returns to the Ultimate Universe in Ultimatum #4 and is instrumental in defeating Magneto. Jean Grey telepathically relays the information discovered by Fury in Ultimate Origins that mutants are not the next stage in human evolution, but are in fact the result of experimentation done by humans. This revelation causes Magneto to reverse the damage done to the Earth's magnetic poles.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the events of Ultimatum, Fury is informed by Hawkeye about how Captain America discovered the secret of the Red Skull. Fury asks head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Carol Danvers for permission to start up a \\"death squad\\" in order to catch the Red Skull and Cap, which he then carries out with the help of Hawkeye, Gregory Stark, and the rest of the Ultimate Avengers.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ultimate Comics: Avengers Fury returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. again. After learning that Captain America went rogue after discovering that the Red Skull was his biological son, Fury re-activated \\"Project Avenger\\" and recruited a team of questionable super humans to find Captain America.[16] Following Captain America's capture, Fury briefed the Avengers of AIM's purpose of creating the Cosmic Cube to build their visioned utopia and readied his team to thwart the organization's plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nFury guided his team of Avengers from headquarters, with the secret intent to go ahead with \\"Plan B\\", which is to detonate a nuclear warhead that was built into War Machines armor by Gregory Stark in case the mission failed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain America managed to arrive at the location of the battle between the Red Skull and the Avengers and teleported the jet to the exact location where the Skull was standing, impaling him through the chest with one of the rods that protrudes from its nose. The Red Skull was taken to a hospital and kept alive long enough for Gail, his mother, to say her goodbyes. Skull explained to Fury that all he wanted to do with the Cosmic Cube was turn back time and prevent his father, Steve Rogers, from being lost during the war so that he could grow up with him and lead a normal life, rather than the one he was given. Petra, dressed as a doctor, then entered the room and shot Red Skull in the head, killing him.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short time later, Fury is fixing his damaged prosthetic arm while speaking with Gregory Stark. Gregory concludes that it was in fact Fury himself who hired the Red Skull to come out of retirement, in some sort of plot to resurrect Project Avengers, securing him a position in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s employment and eventually regaining his old title as Director. Fury told him that was how he got the job the first time, and expects the same outcome this time as well.[17] Fury and his Avengers later faced threats from the Ghost Rider[18] and a vampiric menace.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn \\"Ultimate Enemy\\", approximately six months after Ultimatum, Fury is Black OPS and is \\"Off the Grid\\". He was enjoying a meal while under cover when the restaurant he was at was attacked by a creature with energy powers. Fury manages to hold the creature at bay until Spider-Man and Human Torch arrive at the scene to investigate. The creature vanishes after a short battle with the three of them. Peter is surprised to see Fury alive, as he has not seen him for months.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nNick breaks into the Triskelion and confronts Carol Danvers in the ladies' room and points a gun to her head, exclaiming that she is the only person who knew he was alive and would have motive to have him killed. The two fight before being interrupted by a female S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, informing Danvers that an attack has been made in Queens, which Fury knows is where the Parker residence is located. Simultaneously, the two order a Battalion of Hulkbuster agents to get to Queens to intercept the attacker, where they succeed in apprehending the monster attacking superhumans.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAttempting to atone for his mistakes with Peter, Fury has taken on a more direct mentor role for new Spider-Man Miles Morales.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Peter Parker of Earth-616 is sent to the Ultimate Universe, Fury interrogates him for information about his presence in this universe, accepting Peter's story that he came from another universe as nobody would come up with something that insane as a lie. Peter also notes that Ultimate Nick Fury is a lot cooler than the version he knows.[22] Attempting to atone for his mistakes with his Peter, Fury allows the other Peter to visit his counterpart's family,[23] and is satisfied when Peter gives Miles his blessing to become that world's new Spider-Man.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nNick joined HYDRA using a bio-camouflage to change his appearance under the name of \\"Scorpio\\" (resembling his classic mainstream look), stating that his motivations were to destroy the government that took everything away from him, although he still had a different agenda apart from Hydra's. The Ultimates managed to track him and tried to capture him, believing he was the traitor who provided Hydra with S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons. During an attack to Hydra's Death's Head camp, it was revealed Nick Fury was trying to destroy Hydra from the inside, while the S.H.I.E.L.D. traitor was actually Hydra leader Commander Crimson. Crimson used an Infinity Gem to battle her enemies, until a burst of energy made her disappear along the artifact.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Nick told Monica Chang he was planning to create his own team, the Howling Commandos, to battle Hydra the way the Ultimates couldn't, along ex-Hydra agent Abigail Brand. Before leaving, Chang told Fury he would be under her supervision.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Fury, like Earth-616 Colonel Fury, is an active physical man despite being over 80 years of age.  Initially, General Fury was not shown to use the Infinity Formula or other physical enhancements that the Nick Fury of the mainstream Marvel Universe possessed.  However General Fury was later revealed to have served during World War II and was a test subject of the Super Soldier program (albeit as an unwilling participant).  In this reality, the Super Soldier serum not only gave Fury low level super-human strength and agility but has also reduced his aging, allowing Fury to continue to be active despite his advanced chronological age.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Fury has had his right arm replaced with a cybernetic arm that gives him even greater strength than his enhanced biological original.[28]  The exact level of his cybernetic arm has not been specifically revealed.  Unlike mainstream Colonel Fury who retains his injured eye despite being legally blind in it with a 95% vision loss, General Fury has actually lost his left eye.  The skin around the left eye-socket is shown to be badly scarred, extending beyond the eye patch.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Fury is an exceptional combatant and strategist and a gifted field leader.

The rank of admiral (or full admiral, or four-star admiral) is the highest rank normally achievable in the U.S. Navy. It ranks above vice admiral (three-star admiral) and below fleet admiral (five-star admiral).\\r\\nThere have been 263 four-star admirals in the history of the U.S. Navy. Of these, 222 achieved that rank while on active duty, 40 were promoted upon retirement in recognition of combat citations, and one was promoted posthumously. Admirals entered the Navy via several paths: 232 were commissioned via the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA), 17 via Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC), 8 via Officer Candidate School (OCS), 2 via warrant, 1 via the Naval Aviation Cadet (NAVCAD) Program, 2 via Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS) and 1 via the U.S. Merchant Marine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEntries in the following list of four-star admirals are indexed by the numerical order in which each officer was promoted to that rank while on active duty, or by an asterisk (*) if the officer did not serve in that rank while on active duty. Each entry lists the admiral's name, date of rank,[1] active-duty positions held while serving at four-star rank,[2] number of years of active-duty service at four-star rank (Yrs),[3] year commissioned and source of commission,[4] number of years in commission when promoted to four-star rank (YC),[5] and other biographical notes.[6]\\r\\nThe list is sortable by last name, date of rank, number of years of active-duty service at four-star rank, year commissioned, and number of years in commission when promoted to four-star rank.\\r\\nThe Act of Congress of March 4, 1925, allowed officers in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard to be promoted one grade upon retirement if they had been specially commended for performance of duty in actual combat. Combat citation promotions were colloquially known as \\"tombstone promotions\\" because they conferred all the perks and prestige of the higher rank including the loftier title on their tombstones but no additional retirement pay. The Act of Congress of February 23, 1942, enabled tombstone promotions to three- and four-star grades. Tombstone promotions were subsequently restricted to citations issued before January 1, 1947, and finally eliminated altogether effective November 1, 1959. The practice was terminated in an effort to encourage senior officer retirements prior to the effective date of the change to relieve an overstrength in the senior ranks.\\r\\nAny admiral who actually served in a grade while on active duty receives precedence on the retired list over any tombstone admiral holding the same retired grade. Tombstone admirals rank among each other according to the dates of their highest active duty grade.\\r\\nThe following list of tombstone admirals is sortable by last name, date of rank as vice admiral, date retired, and year commissioned.\\r\\nThe rank of admiral was created in 1866 to honor the Civil War achievements of David Farragut. Upon his death, another Civil War hero, David D. Porter Jr., succeeded to the title. In 1873, Congress stated that further vacancies in the grade would not be filled, and the rank lapsed with Porter's death in 1890. Congress revived the rank in 1899 to honor George Dewey, stipulating that the grade would again cease to exist upon his death or retirement. In 1903, Dewey was promoted to the unique rank of The Admiral of the Navy, which during his lifetime was considered to be equivalent to an admiral of the fleet, but was later declared to be senior to the five-star grade of fleet admiral.\\r\\nThe Act of March 3, 1915, provided that the commanders in chief of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Asiatic Fleets would have the rank of admiral while so serving, and their seconds in command the rank of vice admiral. In 1916, the chief of naval operations was also made an admiral while so serving, ranking next after The Admiral of the Navy. The ranks of admiral and vice admiral were strictly temporary appointments for the duration of an officer's tour in designated billets, and the temporary admiral reverted to his permanent grade of rear admiral immediately upon vacating the office bearing the title.\\r\\nIn 1917, Congress accommodated the Navy's desire to reorganize the fleet by authorizing the President to appoint three admirals and three vice admirals for any six fleet command positions. All fleet command tours lasted one year except for the commander in chief of the U.S. Fleet, whose term was sometimes renewed for a second year, and the commander in chief of the Asiatic Fleet, whose command was considered a backwater. (The chief of naval operations was appointed for four years.) Officers would typically \\"fleet up\\" to admiral or vice admiral for their year of fleet command and then revert to rear admiral to mark time until mandatory retirement.\\r\\nDuring World War II, the President was authorized to create as many admirals and vice admirals as he deemed necessary for the duration of the emergency. Most of these new creations retired at the end of the war, having been promoted to reward service in the fleet or headquarters, or to achieve parity with wartime counterparts. Although three- and four-star ranks remained temporary appointments, the practice of reverting to a lower grade pending retirement largely halted after 1942, when Congress authorized officers to be retired in the highest grade in which they served on active duty.[29] The rank of fleet admiral was created in 1944, and the four officers promoted to that grade were allowed to remain on active duty permanently.\\r\\nBy 1956, the Navy had equilibrated at a total of seven permanent billets bearing four-star rank: the chief of naval operations (CNO); the vice chief of naval operations (VCNO), the commanders in chief of the unified commands in the Pacific (CINCPAC) and Atlantic (CINCLANT); the commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT); the commander in chief of U.S. Naval Forces, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean (CINCNELM) (retitled commander in chief of U.S. Naval Forces Europe (CINCUSNAVEUR) in 1960); and the commander in chief of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces in Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH). In 1965, an eighth billet was added when the chief of naval material (CNM) was promoted to admiral. Occasionally this count would fluctuate when a Navy officer was selected as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), as the chairman's four-star representative to the NATO Military Committee (USMILREP), or as the director or deputy director of central intelligence; or by special legislation.[23]\\r\\nWhen the long-serving director of the naval nuclear reactor program, Hyman G. Rickover, was finally compelled to retire in 1982, his successor was promoted to admiral and appointed director of naval nuclear propulsion, institutionalizing the position as a permanent four-star billet. To compensate, another four-star billet was eliminated by merging Allied Forces Southern Europe with U.S. Naval Forces Europe. Similarly, when the U.S. Atlantic Fleet commander (CINCLANTFLT) was separated from the Atlantic unified commander in 1985, the number of four-star billets was conserved by eliminating the chief of naval material position. The U.S. Atlantic Fleet was replaced by U.S. Fleet Forces Command (COMUSFLTFORCOM) in 2006.\\r\\nWith the end of the Cold War, U.S. Atlantic Command was repurposed as the joint force trainer, becoming U.S. Joint Forces Command in 1999. The change in mission cost the Navy its traditional monopoly over that command, which has since rotated among all the services, but the Navy made up the difference through repeated appointments to other combatant commands and to the vice chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS). All military commanders in chief were retitled \\"Commanders\\" in 2002, when the title of \\"Commander in Chief\\" was reserved solely to the President of the United States.","input":"Who is the highest ranking officer in the navy?"},{"output":"the Atlantic Ocean","context":"An Atlantic hurricane or tropical storm is a tropical cyclone that forms in the Atlantic Ocean, usually in the summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only on the basis of location.[1] A hurricane is a storm that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.[1]\\r\\nTropical cyclones can be categorized by intensity. Tropical storms have one-minute maximum sustained winds of at least 39?mph (34?knots, 17?m/s, 63?km/h), while hurricanes have one-minute maximum sustained winds exceeding 74?mph (64?knots, 33?m/s, 119?km/h).[2] Most North Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between June 1 and November 30.[3] The United States National Hurricane Center monitors the basin and issues reports, watches, and warnings about tropical weather systems for the North Atlantic Basin as one of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for tropical cyclones, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization.[4]\\r\\nIn recent times, tropical disturbances that reach tropical storm intensity are named from a predetermined list. Hurricanes that result in significant damage or casualties may have their names retired from the list at the request of the affected nations in order to prevent confusion should a subsequent storm be given the same name.[5] On average, in the North Atlantic basin (from 1966 to 2009) 11.3 named storms occur each season, with an average of 6.2 becoming hurricanes and 2.3 becoming major hurricanes (Category 3 or greater).[6] The climatological peak of activity is around September 11 each season.[6]\\r\\nIn March 2004, Catarina was the first hurricane-intensity tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Since 2011, the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center has started to use the same scale of the North Atlantic Ocean for tropical cyclones in the South Atlantic Ocean and assign names to those which reach 35?kn (65?km/h; 40?mph).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTropical cyclones are steered by the surrounding flow throughout the depth of the troposphere (the atmosphere from the surface to about eight miles (12?km) high). Neil Frank, former director of the United States National Hurricane Center, used the analogies such as \\"a leaf carried along in a stream\\" or a \\"brick moving through a river of air\\" to describe the way atmospheric flow affects the path of a hurricane across the ocean. Specifically, air flow around high pressure systems and toward low pressure areas influences hurricane tracks.\\r\\nIn the tropical latitudes, tropical storms and hurricanes generally move westward with a slight tendency toward the north, under the influence of the subtropical ridge, a high pressure system that usually extends east-west across the subtropics.[8] South of the subtropical ridge, surface easterly winds (blowing from east to west) prevail. If the subtropical ridge is weakened by an upper trough, a tropical cyclone may turn poleward and then recurve,[9] or curve back toward the northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies. Poleward (north) of the subtropical ridge, westerly winds prevail and generally steer tropical cyclones that reach northern latitudes toward the east. The westerlies also steer extratropical cyclones with their cold and warm fronts from west to east.[10]\\r\\nGenerally speaking, the intensity of a tropical cyclone is determined by either the storm's maximum sustained winds or lowest barometric pressure. The following table lists the most intense Atlantic hurricanes in terms of their lowest barometric pressure. In terms of wind speed, Hurricane Allen (in 1980) was the strongest Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, with maximum sustained winds of 190?mph (310?km/h). However, these measurements are suspect since instrumentation used to document wind speeds at the time would likely succumb to winds of such intensity.[12] Nonetheless, their central pressures are low enough to rank them among the strongest recorded Atlantic hurricanes.[11]\\r\\nOwing to their intensity, the strongest Atlantic hurricanes have all attained Category?5 classification. Hurricane Opal, the strongest Category?4 hurricane recorded, intensified to reach a minimum pressure of 916?mbar (hPa; 27.05?inHg),[13] a pressure typical of Category?5 hurricanes.[14] Nonetheless, the pressure remains too high to list Opal as one of the ten strongest Atlantic tropical cyclones.[11] Presently, Hurricane Wilma is the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, after reaching an intensity of 882?mbar (hPa; 26.05?inHg) in October?2005;[12] this also made Wilma the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide outside of the West Pacific,[15][16][17][18][19] where seven tropical cyclones have been recorded to intensify to lower pressures.[20] However, this was later superseded by Hurricane Patricia in 2015 in the east Pacific, which had a pressure reading of 872 mbar. Preceding Wilma is Hurricane Gilbert, which had also held the record for most intense Atlantic hurricane for 17?years.[21] The 1935 Labor Day hurricane, with a pressure of 892?mbar (hPa; 26.34?inHg), is the third strongest Atlantic hurricane and the strongest documented tropical cyclone prior to 1950.[11] Since the measurements taken during Wilma and Gilbert were documented using dropsonde, this pressure remains the lowest measured over land.[22]\\r\\nHurricane Rita is the fourth strongest Atlantic hurricane in terms of barometric pressure and one of three tropical cyclones from 2005 on the list, with the others being Wilma and Katrina at first and sixth, respectively.[11] However, with a barometric pressure of 895?mbar (hPa; 26.43?inHg), Rita is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico.[23] Hurricanes Camille, Mitch, and Dean share intensities for the seventh strongest Atlantic hurricane at 905?mbar (hPa; 26.73?inHg).[22] The tenth place for most intense Atlantic tropical cyclone is Hurricane Maria listed to have deepened to a pressure as low as 908?mbar (hPa; 26.81?inHg).[11]\\r\\nMany of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones weakened prior to their eventual landfall or demise. However, three of the storms remained intense enough at landfall to be considered some of the strongest landfalling hurricanes?ÿ three of the eleven hurricanes on the list constitute the three most intense Atlantic landfalls in recorded history. The 1935?Labor Day hurricane made landfall at peak intensity, making it the most intense Atlantic landfall. Though it weakened slightly before its eventual landfall on the Yucatn Peninsula, Hurricane Gilbert maintained a pressure of 900?mbar (hPa; 26.58?inHg) at landfall, making its landfall the second strongest. Similarly, Hurricane Dean made landfall on the peninsula, though it did so at peak intensity and with a higher barometric pressure; its landfall marked the third strongest in Atlantic hurricane history.[22]\\r\\nClimatology does serve to characterize the general properties of an average season and can be used as one of many other tools for making forecasts. Most storms form in warm waters several hundred miles north of the equator near the Intertropical convergence zone from tropical waves. The Coriolis force is usually too weak to initiate sufficient rotation near the equator.[25] Storms frequently form in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the tropical Atlantic Ocean as far east as the Cape Verde Islands, the origin of strong and long-lasting Cape Verde-type hurricanes. Systems may also strengthen over the Gulf Stream off the coast of the eastern United States, wherever water temperatures exceed 26.5?C (79.7?F).[25]\\r\\nAlthough most storms are found within tropical latitudes, occasionally storms will form further north and east from disturbances other than tropical waves such as cold fronts and upper-level lows. These are known as baroclinically induced tropical cyclones.[26] There is a strong correlation between Atlantic hurricane activity in the tropics and the presence of an El Ni?o or La Ni?a in the Pacific Ocean. El Ni?o events increase the wind shear over the Atlantic, producing a less-favorable environment for formation and decreasing tropical activity in the Atlantic basin. Conversely, La Ni?a causes an increase in activity due to a decrease in wind shear.[27]\\r\\nAccording to the Azores High hypothesis by Kam-biu Liu, an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the North American Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods (3000ÿ1400 BC, and 1000 AD to present), a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered toward the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period (1400 BC to 1000 AD), more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean.[28][29] Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP,[30] and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity has increased significantly during the past 500ÿ1000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.\\r\\nClimatologically speaking, approximately 97?percent of tropical cyclones that form in the North Atlantic develop between the dates of June?1 and November?30?ÿ dates which delimit the modern-day Atlantic hurricane season. Though the beginning of the annual hurricane season has historically remained the same, the official end of the hurricane season has shifted from its initial date of October?31. Regardless, on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside the limits of the season;[31] as of January?2016 there have been 66?tropical cyclones in the off-season, with the most recent being Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017.[11] The first tropical cyclone of the 1938 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed on January?3, became the earliest forming tropical storm and hurricane after reanalysis concluded on the storm in December?2012.[32]\\r\\nHurricane Able in 1951 was initially thought to be the earliest forming major hurricane?ÿ a tropical cyclone with winds exceeding 115?mph (185?km/h)[nb 1]?ÿ however following post-storm analysis it was determined that Able only reached Category 1?strength which made Hurricane Alma of 1966 the new record holder; as it became a major hurricane on June?8.[11] Though it developed within the bounds of the Atlantic hurricane season,[11][31] Hurricane Audrey in 1957 became the earliest developing Category?4 hurricane on record after it reached the intensity on June?27.[34] However, reanalysis from 1956 to 1960 by NOAA downgraded Audrey to a Category 3, making Hurricane Dennis of 2005 the earliest Category 4 on record on July 8, 2005.[35] The earliest-forming Category?5 hurricane, Emily, reached the highest intensity on the SaffirÿSimpson hurricane wind scale on July?17, 2005.[36]\\r\\nThough the official end of the Atlantic hurricane season occurs on November?30, the dates of October?31 and November?15 have also historically marked the official end date for the hurricane season.[31] December, the only month of the year after the hurricane season, has featured the cyclogenesis of fourteen tropical cyclones.[11] Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005 was the latest tropical cyclone to attain tropical storm intensity as it did so on December?30. However, the second Hurricane Alice in 1954 was the latest forming tropical cyclone to attain hurricane intensity. Both Zeta and Alice were the only two storms to exist in two calendar years?ÿ the former from 1954 to 1955 and the latter from 2005 to 2006.[37] No storms have been recorded to exceed Category?1 hurricane intensity in December.[11] In 1999, Hurricane Lenny reached Category?4 intensity on November?17 as it took an unprecedented west to east track across the Caribbean; its intensity made it the latest developing Category?4 hurricane, though this was well within the bounds of the hurricane season.[38] Hurricane Hattie (October 27-November 1, 1961) was initially thought to have been the latest forming Category?5 hurricane ever documented,[39] though reanalysis indicated that a devastating hurricane in 1932 reached such an intensity at a later date.[11][32] Consequently, this made the hurricane the latest developing tropical cyclone to reach all four SaffirÿSimpson hurricane wind scale classifications past Category?1 intensity.[11]\\r\\nThe beginning of the hurricane season is most closely related to the timing of increases in sea surface temperatures, convective instability, and other thermodynamic factors.[40] Although June marks the beginning of the hurricane season, generally little activity occurs during the month with an average of 1 tropical cyclone every 2?years. Tropical systems usually form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the east coast of the United States.[41]\\r\\nSince 1851, a total of 81 tropical storms and hurricanes formed in the month of June. During this period, two of these systems developed in the deep tropics east of the Lesser Antilles.[41] Since 1870, three major hurricanes have formed during June, most notably Hurricane Audrey in 1957. Audrey attained an intensity greater than that of any Atlantic tropical cyclone during June or July until Hurricanes Dennis and Emily of 2005.[42] The easternmost forming storm during June, Tropical Storm Ana in 1979, formed at 45W.[41]\\r\\nNot much tropical activity occurs during the month of July, but the majority of hurricane seasons see the formation of one tropical cyclone during July. From an average of Atlantic tropical cyclone seasons from 1944 to 1996, the first tropical storm in half of the seasons occurred by 11 July, and a second formed by 8 August.[6]\\r\\nFormation usually occurs in the eastern Caribbean Sea around the Lesser Antilles, in the northern and eastern parts of the Gulf of Mexico, in the vicinity of the northern Bahamas, and off the coast of The Carolinas and Virginia over the Gulf Stream. Storms travel westward through the Caribbean and then either move towards the north and curve near the eastern coast of the United States or stay on a north-westward track and enter the Gulf of Mexico.[11]\\r\\nSince 1851, a total of 105 tropical storms have formed during the month of July.[43] Since 1870, ten of these storms reached major hurricane intensity. Only Hurricane Emily of 2005, the strongest July tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, attained Category 5 hurricane status during July, making it the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record.[42][44] The easternmost forming storm and longest lived during the month of July, Hurricane Bertha in 2008, formed at 22.9W and lasted 17 days.[45]\\r\\nDecrease in wind shear from July to August contributes to a significant increase of tropical activity.[46] An average of 2.8 Atlantic tropical storms develop annually in August. On average, four named tropical storms, including one hurricane, occur by August 30, and the first intense hurricane develops by 4 September.[6]\\r\\nThe peak of the hurricane season occurs in September and corresponds with low wind shear[46] and the warmest sea surface temperatures.[47] The month of September sees an average of 3 storms a year. By 24 September, the average Atlantic season features 7 named tropical storms, including 4 hurricanes. In addition, two major hurricanes occur on average by 28 September. Relatively few tropical cyclones make landfall at these intensities.[6]\\r\\nThe favorable conditions found during September begin to decay in October. The main reason for the decrease in activity is increasing wind shear, although sea surface temperatures are also cooler than in September.[40] Activity falls markedly with 1.8 cyclones developing on average despite a climatological secondary peak around 20 October.[48] By 21 October, the average season features 9 named storms with 5 hurricanes. A third major hurricane occurs after 28 September in half of all Atlantic tropical cyclone seasons.[6] In contrast to mid-season activity, the mean locus of formation shifts westward to the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, reversing the eastward progression of June through August.[11]\\r\\nWind shear from westerlies increases substantially through November, generally preventing cyclone formation.[40] On average, one tropical storm forms during every other November. On rare occasions, a major hurricane occurs. The few intense hurricanes in November include Hurricane \\"Cuba\\" in late October and early November 1932 (the strongest November hurricane on record peaking as a Category 5 hurricane), Hurricane Lenny in mid-November 1999, Hurricane Kate in late November 1985 which was the latest major hurricane formation on record until Hurricane Otto (a category 3 storm) of the 2016 hurricane season.[11] Hurricane Paloma was a very potent category 4 storm that made landfall in Cuba in early November 2008.\\r\\nAlthough the hurricane season is defined as beginning on June?1 and ending on November?30, there have been several off-season storms.[11] Since 1870, there have been 32 off-season cyclones, 18 of which occurred in May. In the same time span, nine storms formed in December, two in April, and one each in January, February and March.[42] During four years (1887,[49] 1953,[50] 2003, and 2007), tropical cyclones formed in the North Atlantic Ocean both during or before May and during December.[51] In 1887, four storms occurred outside the season, the most in a single year.[49] High vertical wind shear and low sea surface temperatures generally preclude tropical cyclone formation during the off-season.[6]\\r\\nTropical cyclones have formed in all months.[42] Four tropical cyclones existed during the month of January, two of which formed during late December: the second Hurricane Alice in 1954/1955, and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005/2006. The only two hurricanes to form in January are a Category 1 hurricane in the 1938 season, and Hurricane Alex in the 2016 season. A subtropical storm in January also began the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season.[11] No major hurricanes have occurred in the off-season.[52]\\r\\nWhile the number of storms in the Atlantic has increased since 1995, there is no obvious global trend. The annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 87?I?10. However, the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere.[58] In spite of that, there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing. In 2006, Kerry Emanuel stated, \\"Records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane (again considering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70% in the past 30?years or so, corresponding to about a 15% increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime.\\"[59] At the time, Emanuel theorized that increased heat from global warming was driving this trend, however, some argue that Emanuel's own research in 2008 refuted this theory. Others contend that the trend does not exist at all, but instead is a figment created by faulty readings from primitive 1970s-era measurement equipment.[citation needed] Vecchi and Knutson (2008) found a weakly positive, although not statistically-significant trend in the number of North Atlantic tropical cyclones for 1878ÿ2006, but also a surprisingly strong decrease in cyclone duration over this period.[60]\\r\\nOn May 15, 2014, the journal Nature published a peer-reviewed submission from October 2013 by James P. Kossin, Kerry A. Emanuel, and Gabriel A. Vecchi that suggests that a poleward migration exists for the paths of maximum intensity of tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic.[61] The focus of the report is on the latitude at which recent tropical cyclones in the Atlantic are reaching maximum intensity. Their data indicates that during the past thirty years, the peak intensity of these storms has shifted poleward in both hemispheres at a rate of approximately 60?km per decade, amounting to approximately one degree of latitude per decade.\\r\\nAtlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially, since five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have occurred since 1990. According to the World Meteorological Organization, recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has largely been caused by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions.[62] Pielke et al. (2008) normalized mainland U.S. hurricane damage from 1900ÿ2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade 1996ÿ2005 has the second most damage among the past 11 decades, with only the decade 1926ÿ1935 surpassing its costs. The most damaging single storm is the 1926 Miami hurricane, with $157?billion of normalized damage.[63]\\r\\nOften in part because of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect.[64] Christopher Landsea et al. estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.[65]\\r\\nThe number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50ÿ70?year cycle, also known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.[66] Nyberg et al. reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early eighteenth century and found five periods averaging 3ÿ5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40ÿ60?years, and six other averaging 1.5ÿ2.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10ÿ20?years. These periods are associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Throughout, a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1ÿ2 per year.[67]\\r\\nAlthough more uncommon since 1995, few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during 1970ÿ94.[68] Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926ÿ60, including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933, a record only recently exceeded in 2005, which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900ÿ25; however, many intense storms formed during 1870ÿ99. During the 1887 season, 19 tropical storms formed, of which a record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City. Some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as Category 4 in strength.[69]\\r\\nThese active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the Atlantic basin. Before the satellite era began in 1960, tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one, a ship reported a voyage through the storm, or a storm landed in a populated area.[64] The official record, therefore, could miss storms in which no ship experienced gale-force winds, recognized it as a tropical storm (as opposed to a high-latitude extra-tropical cyclone, a tropical wave, or a brief squall), returned to port, and reported the experience.\\r\\nProxy records based on paleotempestological research have revealed that major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia.[28][29][70] Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000ÿ1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3ÿ5 times. This millennial-scale variability has been attributed to long-term shifts in the position of the Azores High,[29] which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.[71]\\r\\nAccording to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP,[30] and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3,000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500ÿ1000?years, just as the Gulf Coast was amid a quiescent period during the last millennium. Evidence also shows that the average latitude of hurricane impacts has been steadily shifting northward, towards the Eastern Seaboard over the past few centuries. This change has been sped up in modern times due to the Arctic Ocean heating up especially much from fossil fuel-caused global warming.[72]","input":"What is the birthplace of an atlantic basin hurricane?"},{"output":"the Leamington Tennis Club","context":"The game that most people call 'tennis' is the direct descendant of what is now known as real tennis or royal tennis (which continues to be played today as a separate sport with more complex rules). Most rules of the game commonly known as tennis derive from it. It is reasonable to see both sports as variations of the same game. The idea that tennis originated in the monastic cloisters in northern France in the 12th century has been largely discredited, but it is correct that in the first few centuries in which it was played, the ball was then struck with the palm of the hand; hence, the name jeu de paume (\\"game of the palm\\").[1] It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use, and the game began to be called \\"tennis.\\" It was popular in England and France, and Henry VIII of England was a big fan of the game, now referred to as real tennis.[2]\\r\\nMany original tennis courts remain, including courts at Oxford, Cambridge, Falkland Palace in Fife where Mary Queen of Scots regularly played, and Hampton Court Palace. Many of the French courts were decommissioned with the terror that accompanied the French Revolution. The Tennis Court Oath (Serment du Jeu de Paume) was a pivotal event during the first days of the French Revolution. The Oath was a pledge signed by 576 of the 577 members from the Third Estate who were locked out of a meeting of the Estates-General on 20 June 1789. Any history of tennis that ignores its origins in the game that was (and is still in certain circles) known as tennis until \\"lawn tennis\\" became popular in the late nineteenth century is inaccurate.\\r\\nThe Davis Cup, an annual competition between men's national teams, dates to 1900.[3] The analogous competition for women's national teams, the Fed Cup, was founded as the Federation Cup in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the International Tennis Federation, also known as the ITF.\\r\\nIn 1926, promoter C.C. Pyle created the first professional tennis tour with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences.[4][5] The most notable of these early professionals were the American Vinnie Richards and the Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen.[4][6] Once a player turned pro he or she could not compete in the major (amateur) tournaments.[4]\\r\\nIn 1968, commercial pressures and rumors of some amateurs taking money under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction, inaugurating the open era, in which all players could compete in all tournaments, and top players were able to make their living from tennis.[7] With the beginning of the open era, the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit, and revenues from the sale of television rights, tennis's popularity has spread worldwide, and the sport has shed its upper/middle-class English-speaking image[8] (although it is acknowledged that this stereotype still exists).[8][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people believe that the word \\"Tennis\\" came into use in English in the mid-13th century from Old French, via the Anglo-Norman term Tenez, which can be translated as \\"hold!\\", \\"receive!\\" or \\"take!\\", but there is no reference to this in contemporary literature and so there is no evidence of this derivation. A call from the server to his opponent indicating that he is about to serve.[11] The first known appearance of the word in English literature is by poet John Gower in his poem titled 'In Praise of Peace' dedicated to King Henry IV and composed in 1400; \\"Of the tenetz to winne or lese a chase, Mai no lif wite er that the bal be ronne\\". (Whether a chase is won or lost at tennis, Nobody can know until the ball is run).[a][13][14][15][16]\\r\\nTennis is mentioned in literature as far back as the Middle Ages. In The Second Shepherds' Play (c. 1500) shepherds gave three gifts, including a tennis ball, to the newborn Christ. Sir Gawain, a knight of King Arthur's round table, plays tennis against a group of 17 giants in The Turke and Gowin (c. 1500).[17][18]\\r\\nThe Medieval form of tennis is termed as real tennis, a game that evolved over three centuries, from an earlier ball game played around the 12th century in France which involved hitting a ball with a bare hand and later with a glove.[19][20] By the 16th century, the glove had become a racquet, the game had moved to an enclosed playing area, and the rules had stabilized. Real tennis spread in popularity throughout royalty in Europe, reaching its peak in the 16th century.\\r\\nIn 1437 at the Blackfriars, Perth, the playing of tennis indirectly led to the death of King James I of Scotland, when the drain outlet, through which he hoped to escape assassins, had been blocked to prevent the loss of tennis balls.[21] James was trapped and killed.[22]\\r\\nFrancis I of France (1515ÿ47) was an enthusiastic player and promoter of real tennis, building courts and encouraging play among the courtiers and commoners. His successor Henry II (1547ÿ59) was also an excellent player and continued the royal French tradition. In 1555 an Italian priest, Antonio Scaino da Salothe, wrote the first known book about tennis, Trattato del Giuoco della Palla. Two French kings died from tennis related episodesLouis X of a severe chill after playing and Charles VIII after hitting his head during a game.[23] King Charles IX granted a constitution to the Corporation of Tennis Professionals in 1571, creating the first pro tennis 'tour', establishing three professional levels: apprentice, associate, and master. A professional named Forbet wrote and published the first codification of the rules in 1599.[24]\\r\\nRoyal interest in England began with Henry V (1413ÿ22.) Henry VIII (1509ÿ47) made the biggest impact as a young monarch; playing the game with gusto at Hampton Court on a court he built in 1530. It is believed that his second wife Anne Boleyn was watching a game when she was arrested and that Henry was playing when news of her execution arrived. During the reign of James I (1603ÿ25), London had 14 courts.[25]\\r\\nReal tennis is mentioned in literature by William Shakespeare who mentions \\"tennis balles\\" in Henry V (1599), when a basket of them is given to King Henry as a mockery of his youth and playfulness; the incident is also mentioned in some earlier chronicles and ballads.[26] One of the most striking early references appears in a painting by Giambattista Tiepolo entitled The Death of Hyacinth (1752ÿ1753) in which a strung racquet and three tennis balls are depicted. The painting's theme is the mythological story of Apollo and Hyacinth, written by Ovid. Giovanni Andrea dell'Anguillara translated it into Italian in 1561 and replaced the ancient game of discus, in the original text with pallacorda or tennis, which had achieved a high status at the courts in the middle of the 16th century. Tiepolo's painting, displayed at the Museo Thyssen Bornemisza in Madrid, was ordered in 1752 by German count Wilhelm Friedrich Schaumburg Lippe, who was an avid tennis player.\\r\\nThe game thrived among the 17th-century nobility in France, Spain, Italy, and in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but suffered under English Puritanism. By the Age of Napoleon, the royal families of Europe were besieged and real tennis was largely abandoned.[27] Real tennis played a minor role in the history of the French Revolution, through the Tennis Court Oath, a pledge signed by French deputies on a real tennis court, which formed a decisive early step in starting the revolution. In England, during the 18th and early 19th centuries as real tennis declined, three other racquet sports emerged: racquets, squash racquets, and lawn tennis (the modern game).\\r\\nThe modern sport is tied to two separate inventions.\\r\\nBetween 1859 and 1865, in Birmingham, England, Major Harry Gem, a solicitor, and his friend Augurio Perera, a Spanish merchant, combined elements of the game of rackets and the Spanish ball game pelota and played it on a croquet lawn in Edgbaston.[28][29] In 1872, both men moved to Leamington Spa and in 1874, with two doctors from the Warneford Hospital, founded the world's first tennis club, the Leamington Tennis Club.[30]\\r\\nIn December 1873, Major Walter Clopton Wingfield designed and patented an hourglass-shaped tennis court in order to obtain a patent on his court, as a rectangular court, already in use in other versions of outdoor, lawn tennis, was unpatentable by him, and a temporary patent on his hourglass-shaped court was granted to him in February, 1874, which he never renewed when it expired in 1877. It is commonly believed, mistakenly, that Wingfield obtained a patent on the game he devised to be played on that type of court, but in fact Wingfield never applied for nor received a patent on his game, although he did obtain a copyright  but not a patent  on his rules for playing it. And, after a running series of articles and letters in the British sporting magazine The Field, and a meeting at London's Marylebone Cricket Club, the official rules of lawn tennis were promulgated by that Club in 1875, which preserved none of the aspects of the variations that Wingfield had dreamed up and called Sphairistik (Greek: ????, that is, \\"sphere-istic\\", an ancient Greek adjective meaning \\"of or pertaining to use of a ball, globe or sphere\\"), which was soon corrupted to \\"sticky.\\" Wingfield claimed that he had invented his version of the game for the amusement of his guests at a weekend garden party on his estate of Nantclwyd, in Llanelidan, Wales in 1874, but research has demonstrated that even his game was not likely played during that country weekend in Wales.[31][32] He had likely based his game on both the evolving sport of outdoor tennis and on real tennis. Much of modern tennis terminology also derives from this period, as Wingfield and others borrowed both the name and much of the French vocabulary of real tennis and applied them to their variations of real tennis.[33] Wingfield did patent his hourglass court [34] in 1874 but not his eight-page rule book titled \\"Sphairistike or Lawn Tennis\\",[35] but he failed in enforcing his patent.[36] In his version, the game was played on an hourglass shaped court and the net was higher (4 feet 8 inches) than it is in official lawn tennis. The service had to be made from a diamond-shaped box in the middle of one side of the court only, and the service had to bounce beyond the service line instead of in front of it. He adopted the rackets-based system of scoring where games consisted of 15 points (called 'aces').[37] None of these quirks survived the Marylebone Cricket Club's 1875 Rules of Lawn Tennis that have been official, with periodic slight modifications, ever since then. Those rules were adopted by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club for the first Lawn Tennis Championship, at Wimbledon in 1877 (the men who devised those rules were members of both clubs). Wingfield does deserve great credit for popularizing the game of lawn tennis, as he marketed, in one boxed set, all the equipment needed to play his or other versions of it, equipment that had been available previously only at several different outlets. Because of this convenience, versions of the game spread like wildfire in Britain, and by 1875 lawn tennis had virtually supplanted croquet and badminton as outdoor games for both men and women.\\r\\nMary Ewing Outerbridge played the game in Bermuda at Clermont, a house with a spacious lawn in Paget parish.[38] Innumerable histories claim that in 1874 Mary returned from Bermuda aboard the ship S.S. Canima and introduced lawn tennis to the United States,[39] setting up supposedly the first tennis court in the United States on the grounds of the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club, which was near where the Staten Island Ferry Terminal is today.[40] The club was founded on or about March 22, 1872. She is also mistakenly said to have played the first tennis game in the US against her sister Laura in Staten Island, New York, on an hourglass-shaped court.[40] However, all this would have been impossible, as the tennis equipment she is said to have brought back from Bermuda was not available in Bermuda until 1875, and her next trip to Bermuda, when it was available there, was in 1877. In fact, lawn tennis was first introduced in the United States on a grass court on Col. William Appleton's Estate in Nahant, Massachusetts by Dr. James Dwight (\\"the Father of American Lawn Tennis\\"), Henry Slocum, Richard Dudley Sears and Sears' half-brother Fred Sears, in 1874.\\r\\nWingfield borrowed both the name and much of the French vocabulary of real tennis:\\r\\nThe four majors or Grand Slam tournaments, the four biggest competitions on the tennis circuit, are Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open, and the Australian Open. Since the mid 1920s they became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis.[4][47] Winning these four tournaments in the same year is called the Grand Slam (a term borrowed from bridge).[48]\\r\\nThe Championships, Wimbledon, were founded by the All England Club in 1877 to raise money for the club.[49] The first Championships were contested by 22 men and the winner received a Silver Gilt Cup proclaiming the winner to be \\"The All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Champion of the World\\".[50] The first Championships culminated a significant debate on how to standardize the rules. The following year it was recognized as the official British Championships, although it was open to international competitors. In 1884 the Ladies Singles and Gentlemen's Doubles Championships were inaugurated, followed by the Ladies and Mixed Doubles in 1913.[51]\\r\\nName\\r\\n1877: The Championships\\r\\nSurface\\r\\n1877: Grass\\r\\nVenue change\\r\\n1877: Worple Road, Wimbledon\\r\\n1922: Church Road, Wimbledon\\r\\nTennis was first played in the U.S. on a grass court set up on the Estate of Col. William Appleton in Nahant Massachusetts by James Dwight, Richard Dudley Sears and Fred Sears in 1874.[52] In 1881, the desire to play tennis competitively led to the establishment of tennis clubs.[4]\\r\\nThe first American National tournament was played in 1880 at the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club in New York. An Englishman named Otway Woodhouse won the singles match. There was also a doubles match which was won by a local pair. There were different rules at each club. The ball in Boston was larger than the one normally used in NY. On May 21, 1881, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the United States Tennis Association) was formed to standardize the rules and organize competitions.[53]\\r\\nThe US National Men's Singles Championship, now the US Open, was first held in 1881 at Newport, Rhode Island.[54] The U.S. National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia.[55]\\r\\nThe tournament was made officially one of the tennis 'Majors' from 1924 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF).\\r\\nName change\\r\\n1881: U.S. National Championship\\r\\n1968: U.S. Open\\r\\nSurface change\\r\\n1881: Grass\\r\\n1975: Clay Har-Tru\\r\\n1978: Hard DecoTurf\\r\\nVenue change (men's championship)\\r\\n1881: Newport\\r\\n1915: Forest Hills\\r\\n1921: Germantown\\r\\n1924: Forest Hills\\r\\n1978: Flushing Meadows\\r\\nTennis was predominantly a sport of the English-speaking world, dominated by Great Britain and the United States.[56] It was also popular in France, where the French Open dates to 1891 as the Championat de France International de Tennis.

Because of its geographic remoteness, historically, the event did not gain attendance from the top tennis players. It became one of the major tennis tournaments starting in 1924 (designated by the ILTF). In 1927, because of New Zealand tennis authorities releasing their commitments to the tournament, it became known as the Australian Championships. For most of the 1970s and the early 1980s, the event lacked participation from top ranked tennis professionals. Since its move to Melbourne Park in 1988, the Australian Open has gained the popularity of the other three majors.\\r\\nName change\\r\\n1905: Australasian Championships\\r\\n1927: Australian Championships\\r\\n1969: Australian Open\\r\\nSurface change\\r\\n1905: Grass\\r\\n1988: Hard Rebound Ace\\r\\n2008: Hard Plexicushion\\r\\nVenue change\\r\\n1905: Melbourne\\r\\n1906: Christchurch and alternated in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth.

Davis of the Harvard University tennis team designed a tournament format with the idea of challenging the British to a tennis showdown.[57] The first match, between the United States and Great Britain was held in Boston, Massachusetts in 1900.[58] The American team, of which Dwight Davis was a part, surprised the British by winning the first three matches. By 1905 the tournament had expanded to include Belgium, Austria, France, and Australasia, a combined team from Australia and New Zealand that competed jointly until 1913.\\r\\nThe tournament was initially known as the \\"International Lawn Tennis Challenge\\". It was renamed the Davis Cup following the death of Dwight Davis in 1945. The tournament has vastly expanded and, on its 100th anniversary in 1999, 130 nations competed.\\r\\n1913 also saw twelve national tennis associations agree at a Paris conference to form the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), which was renamed in 1977 as the current International Tennis Federation (ITF).[59] The rules the association promulgated in 1924 have remained remarkably stable in the ensuing ninety years, the one major change being the addition of the tie-break system designed by James Van Alen.[60]\\r\\nThat same year, tennis withdrew from the Olympics after the 1924 Games but returned 60 years later as a 21-and-under demonstration event in 1984. This reinstatement was credited by the efforts by the then ITF President Philippe Chatrier, ITF General Secretary David Gray and ITF Vice President Pablo Llorens, and support from IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. The success of the event was overwhelming and the IOC decided to reintroduce tennis as a full medal sport at Seoul in 1988.\\r\\nThe idea of a Davis Cup-style tournament for national women's teams is surprisingly oldit was first proposed in 1919 by Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman. After she was turned down, she donated a trophy in 1923 that would be known as the Wightman Cup, awarded in an annual match between the two strongest women's tennis nations of the time, the United States and Great Britain.[61]\\r\\nWightman's original idea for a worldwide women's team tournament would bear fruit more than 40 years later in 1962, when Nell Hopman persuaded the ITF to begin sponsoring such an event. The first Federation Cup was played in 1963 as part of the ITF's 50th anniversary celebrations; it involved 16 countries and was played over one week. By the 1990s, over 70 nations competed each year, and regional qualifiers were introduced in 1992. In 1995, the ITF introduced a new Davis Cup-style format for the competition and rechristened it the Fed Cup.\\r\\nIn 1926, promoter C. C. Pyle established the first professional tour with a group of American and French players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences.[4][62] The most notable early professionals were American Vinnie Richards and Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen.[4][6] Once a player turned pro he or she could not compete in the major (amateur) tournaments.[4]\\r\\nThe leading professional players were under contract with a professional promoter before the Open Era who controlled their appearances. For example, Suzanne Lenglen and Vincent Richards toured North America under contract to Charles C. Pyle. The main events of the professional circuit comprised head-to-head competition and by-invitation Pro Championships, which were the precedents for the Grand Slam tournaments before the Open Era began in 1968.\\r\\nIn the years before the open era, male professionals often played more frequently on tours than in tournaments because head-to-head tours between two stars paid much better than tournaments and the number of professional tournaments was small. For example, Fred Perry earned U.S. $91,000 ($1,549,106 today) in a 1937 North American tour against Ellsworth Vines but won only U.S. $450 ($7,823) for his 1938 victory at the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships. Vines probably never entered a tournament in 1937 and 1938. In 1937, Vines played 70 matches on two tours and no tournament matches. Even in the 1950s, some professionals continued to play tour matches. During his first five months as a professional (January through May 1957), Ken Rosewall played 76 matches on a tour against Pancho Gonzales but only 9 tournament matches. Joe McCauley determined that for 1952, only 7 professional tournaments were played by the top international players, and 2 other professional tournaments (the British Pro and the German Pro) were reserved for domestic players. Only during the 1960s did professional tournaments become more significant than tours.\\r\\nIn addition to head-to-head events several annual professional tournaments were called championship tournaments. The most prestigious was usually the Wembley Championship, held at the Wembley Arena in England, played between 1934 and 1990. The oldest was the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, played between 1927 and 1999. Between 1954 and 1962, it was played indoors in Cleveland and was called the World Professional Championships. The third major tournament was the French Pro Championship, played between 1930 and 1968. The British and American championships continued into the Open era but devolved to the status of minor tournaments after the late 1960s.\\r\\nThe Tournament of Champions was held between 1956 and 1959, the 1956 edition taking place in Los Angeles and the 1957, 1958 and 1959 editions taking place at Forest Hills. There was also the Wimbledon Pro tournament held in August 1967, the first tournament where professional tennis players were allowed to play at Wimbledon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"open era\\" began in 1968 when Grand Slam tournaments agreed to allow professional players to compete with amateurs.[63] Before 1968, only amateurs were allowed to compete in Grand Slam tournaments and other events organized or sanctioned by the ILTF, including Davis Cup.\\r\\nThe move is made because the English are tired of the hypocrisy in the sport, the shamateurism that plagues high-class tennis. It is well known that amateurs bargain for ÿ and receive ÿ exorbitant expenses to compete at many tournaments. \\"We must take action on our own account to make the game honest\\", said Derek Penmam of the British association. \\"For too long now we have been governed by a set of amateur rules that are quite unenforceable.\\"[63]\\r\\nDuring the first years of the open era, power struggles between the ILTF and the commercial promoters led to boycotts of Grand Slam events. The first open era event was the 1968 British Hard Court Championships held in April at The West Hants Club in Bournemouth, England,[64] while the first open Grand Slam tournament was the 1968 French Open in May.[65] Both tournaments were won by Ken Rosewall. The open era allowed all tennis players the opportunity to make a living by playing tennis.[66]\\r\\nIn 1968, a few professionals were independent, including Lew Hoad, Mal Anderson, Luis Ayala, and Owen Davidson, but most of the best players were under contract. George McCall operated the National Tennis League (NTL) and managed Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Andrs Gimeno, Pancho Gonzales, Fred Stolle and Roy Emerson. Dave Dixon (later succeeded by Lamar Hunt) ran World Championship Tennis (WCT) and managed the \\"Handsome Eight\\": John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Nikola Pili?, Roger Taylor, Pierre Barths, Earl \\"Butch\\" Buchholz, Cliff Drysdale and Dennis Ralston In 1968, the original Handsome Eight WCT players were not allowed to participate in the French Open.[why?] In 1970, NTL players did not play the Australian Open because their organization did not receive a guarantee. In 1970, neither WCT nor NTL players played in the French Open.\\r\\nIn the first two years of the open era, the NTL and WCT promoters began to take control of the game. To outmaneuver them, Jack Kramer, the best player of the late 1940s / early 1950s, and at that time a promoter, conceived the Grand Prix tennis circuit in late 1969. He described it as:\\r\\n. . . a series of tournaments with a money bonus pool that would be split up on the basis of a cumulative point system. This would encourage the best players to compete regularly in the series, so that they could share in the bonus at the end and qualify for a special championship tournament that would climax the year.[67]\\r\\nIn 1970, none of the contract players participated in the French Open. The International Lawn Tennis Federation, alarmed by the control of the promoters, approved Kramer's Grand Prix. Twenty seven tournaments including the three Grand Slams, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open were played that year, with Stockholm tournament ending on 1 November. The independent professional players along with a few contract players, entered the Grand Prix circuit. Contract players could play Grand Prix events provided their contracts allowed it, and that they had adequate time apart from their own circuit.\\r\\nThe first WCT tournaments were held in February 1968 and the first NTL tournaments in March 1969. In spring 1970, the WCT absorbed the NTL. At the end of 1970, a panel of journalists ranked the players, leading the WCT to send invitations to the 32 top men to play the 1971 WCT circuit: among the 32, Ilie N?stase, Stan Smith, Jan Kode?, ?eljko Franulovi? and Clark Graebner stayed independent. In 1971, the WCT ran 20 tournaments, and concluded the year with the WCT Finals. In 1971, the majority of the best players still mainly played the WCT circuit. Thus, the 1971 Australian Open was a WCT competition whereas the French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open were ILTF Grand Prix events.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy then, the rivalry between the two groups became so intense that Rosewall, Gimeno, Laver, Emerson and some other WCT players boycotted the 1971 US Open (although Newcombe played and lost in the first round to Kodes). Bill Riordan (the future manager of Jimmy Connors) complicated matters further with a third professional tour, the U.S. Indoor Circuit. In 1972, the conflict between the ILTF and the WCT culminated in the ILTF banning the contract professional players from all ILTF Grand Prix events between January and July, which included the 1972 French Open and 1972 Wimbledon.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the 1972 US Open in September, all the players attended and agreed to form a player syndicate to protect themselves from the promoters and associations, resulting in the creation of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).\\r\\nIn 1973, there were four rival professional circuits: the WCT circuit, the Grand Prix circuit, the U.S. Indoor Circuit with Connors and Ilie N?stase and the European Spring Circuit with N?stase as their star. During the year, the ILTF banned Nikola Pili? from 1973 Wimbledon, due to Pilic's alleged refusal to play in Yugoslavia's Davis Cup tie against New Zealand. In retaliation, 81 out of 84 of Pilic's fellow players who were ATP members, boycotted 1973 Wimbledon in response, stating that professional players should have the right of deciding whether to play Davis Cup matches or not. The only ATP players who refused to boycott 1973 Wimbledon were Ilie N?stase, Roger Taylor and Ray Keldie. They were later fined by the ATP for their participation in the tournament.\\r\\nBetween 1974 and 1978, any tennis player who participated in World Team Tennis was banned by the French Tennis Federation from playing in the French Open in the same calendar year.[why?]\\r\\nIn 1978 the ILTF Grand Prix and WCT circuits merged. However, In 1982, the WCT circuit separated again and created a more complex WCT ranking, similar to the ATP ranking. The WCT wasn't as successful in the 1980s, and the Grand Prix circuit became the primary circuit. The Grand Prix's governance was led by the 'Men's International Professional Tennis Council (MIPTC)' (also called the Men's Tennis Council (MTC)).[68] The WCT Finals in Dallas continued being held until the end of the 1980s, and then disbanded with the creation of the ATP Tour for 1990.\\r\\nThe open era, the global professional circuit, and television helped tennis spread globally and shed its elitist, anglocentric image. In America in the 1970s, courts are a common feature of public recreational facilities. Accordingly, in the 1970s the U.S. Open moved from the posh West Side Tennis Club to a public park (the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, Flushing Meadows Park) that is accessible to anyone who buys a ticket.[69] About the same time, the ruling body's name changed from the United States Lawn Tennis Association to the United States Tennis Association.[70]\\r\\nIn 1990, the Association of Tennis Professionals, led by Hamilton Jordan, replaced the MTC as the governing body of men's professional tennis. They established the ATP Tour, and packaged the nine most prestigious events as the \\"Championship Series - Single Tournament Week\\", and beginning in 1996, as the \\"Super Nine\\". Twelve of the Grand Prix which were slightly less prestigious than the first nine events were renamed as the \\"Championship Series - Double Week\\" (meaning in most cases, 2 of those tournaments occurred the same week), and commencing in 1996, as International Series Gold, while the remaining (approximately 60) became known as the International Series. Winning a Super Nine tournament was worth roughly half the points (370) of winning a Grand Slam tournament (750), while International Series Gold tournament was worth as much as 360 points depending on the total prize money. The format continued until 2000 at which time the Super Nine were renamed the Masters Series (the winner being awarded 500 points), occupying the rank below the Grand Slams (1000 points for the winner), and the International Series Gold were renamed to simply the Championship Series (worth 250 to 300 points for the winner). In 2000, the Grand Slam tournaments and the Masters Series tournaments became mandatory professional events if a player's ranking qualifies them for the tournament. Players were automatically entered and Masters and Slam events became the baseline for player rankings with up to an additional 5 tournaments also counted (18 in all plus the ATP Finals if they qualify). Before 2000, a players' best 14 tournaments were counted towards the ATP Point Rankings.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Masters events were renamed the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 with the Monte-Carlo Masters becoming a non-mandatory event, meaning a player could use his results from a lower-level tournament in place of it. International Series Gold became the ATP World Tour 500 and the remaining events became the ATP World Tour 250. The numbers in the tournament type name indicate the winners' ranking points. By way of comparison, a winner of one of the four Grand Slam tournaments is awarded 2000 points. In 2009, a great emphasis began to be placed on winning the tournament, as the points awarded to the runner-up dropped from 70% of the champion's points to 60% (i.e. from 700 points to 600 points in a Grand Slam event). Points also began to be awarded for Davis Cup singles play.\\r\\nWomen's professional tennis began in 1926, when world number one female player Suzanne Lenglen accepted $50,000 for a series of matches against three-time US Champion Mary K. Browne. The series ended in 1927, and the women did not compete as professionals again until 1941 when Alice Marble headlined a tour against Mary Hardwick. World War II hindered most professional competitions and many players were involved with entertaining the troops. In 1947, women professionals were again in action with a short-lived series of exhibition matches between Pauline Betz and Sarah Palfrey Cooke, both U.S. National Champions. In 1950 and 1951, Bobby Riggs signed Betz and Gussie Moran to play a pro tour with Jack Kramer and Pancho Segura, wherein Betz dominated Moran. Althea Gibson turned professional in 1958 and joined with Karol Fageros (\\"the Golden Goddess\\") as the opening act for the Harlem Globetrotters for one season.\\r\\nThere was virtually no further women's professional tennis until 1967, when promoter George McCall signed Billie Jean King, Ann Jones, Fran?oise Drr, and Rosie Casals to join his tour of eight men for two years.[71] The professional women then played as independents as the open era began.\\r\\nIn 1970, promoter for the Pacific Southwest Championships in Los Angeles Jack Kramer offered the women only $7,500 in prize money versus the men's total of $50,000. When Kramer refused to match the men's prize money, King and Casals urged the other women to boycott.\\r\\nGladys Heldman, American publisher of World Tennis magazine, responded with a separate women's tour under the sponsorship of Virginia Slims cigarettes. In 1971 and 1972 the WT Women's Pro Tour offered nearly ten times the prize money of other pro women's tennis events. The USLTA initially would not sanction the tour; however, the two groups determined to give Virginia Slims the individual events, and the USLTA the tour, thus resolving the conflict. In 1973, the U.S. Open made history by offering equal prize money to men and women. Billie Jean King, the most visible advocate for the women's cause, earned over $100,000 in 1971 and 1972.[72]\\r\\nIn the famous Battle of the Sexes exhibition match against the vocally sexist Bobby Riggs in September 1973, King brought even more media attention to tennis, and to women professionals in all walks of life by beating Riggs.\\r\\nThe Women's Tennis Association, formed in 1973, is the principal organizing body of women's professional tennis, organizing the worldwide, professional WTA Tour. From 1984ÿ98, the finals matches of the championship event were best-of-five, uniquely among women's tournaments. In 1999, the finals reverted to best-of-three. The WTA Tour Championships are generally considered to be the women's fifth most prestigious event (after the four Grand Slam tournaments.) Sponsors have included Virginia Slims (1971ÿ78), Avon (1979ÿ82), Virginia Slims again (1983ÿ94), J.P. Morgan Chase (1996ÿ2000), Sanex (2001) Home Depot (2002), and Sony Ericsson (2006).\\r\\nIn 1954, James Van Alen founded the International Tennis Hall of Fame, a non-profit museum in Newport, Rhode Island.[73] The building contains a large collection of memorabilia as well as honoring prominent players and others. Each year, a grass-court tournament takes place on its grounds, as well as an induction ceremony honoring new members.","input":"Which is the first tennis club to be established?"},{"output":"Alfred the Great, King of Wessex","context":"This list of kings and queens of the Kingdom of England begins with Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, one of the petty kingdoms to rule a portion of modern England. Alfred styled himself King of the Anglo-Saxons and while he was not the first king to lay claim to rule all of the English, his rule represents the first unbroken line of Kings to rule the whole of England, the House of Wessex.[1] The last monarch of a distinct kingdom of England was Queen Anne, who became Queen of Great Britain when England merged with Scotland to form a union in 1707. For monarchs after Queen Anne, see List of British monarchs.\\r\\nArguments are made for a few different kings deemed to control enough of the ancient kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons to be deemed the first King of England. For example, Offa, king of Mercia, and Egbert, king of Wessex, are sometimes described as kings of England by popular writers, but not by all historians.[citation needed] In the late eighth century Offa achieved a dominance over southern England that did not survive his death in 796. In 829 Egbert conquered Mercia, but he soon lost control of it. By the late ninth century Wessex was the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Its king, Alfred the Great, was overlord of western Mercia and used the title King of the Angles and Saxons, but he never ruled eastern and northern England, which was then the Danelaw. His son Edward the Elder conquered the eastern Danelaw, but Edward's son ?thelstan became the first king to rule the whole of England when he conquered Northumbria in 927, and he is regarded by some modern historians as the first king of England.[2][3]\\r\\nThe Principality of Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England under the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284, and in 1301 King Edward I invested his eldest son, the future King Edward II, as Prince of Wales. Since that time, except for King Edward III, the eldest sons of all English monarchs have borne this title. After the death of Queen Elizabeth I without issue, in 1603, the crowns of England and Scotland were joined in personal union under King James VI of Scotland, who became James I of England. By royal proclamation, James styled himself \\"King of Great Britain\\", but no such kingdom was created until 1707, when England underwent legislative union with Scotland to form the new Kingdom of Great Britain, during the reign of Queen Anne.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDisputed claimant\\r\\nThere is some evidence that ?lfweard of Wessex may have been king for up to four weeks in 924 (timing itself is unclear, as he died 16 days, not 28 days, after his father), between his father Edward the Elder and his brother ?thelstan, although he was not crowned.[7] However, this is not accepted by all historians. Also, it is unclear whether ?lfweard was declared king of the whole kingdom or of Wessex only: there is evidence that when Edward died, ?lfweard was declared king in Wessex and ?thelstan in Mercia.[8]\\r\\nEngland came under the control of Sweyn Forkbeard, a Danish king, after an invasion in 1013, during which ?thelred abandoned the throne and went into exile in Normandy.\\r\\nFollowing the death of Sweyn Forkbeard, ?thelred the Unready returned from exile and was again proclaimed king on 3 February 1014. His son succeeded him after being chosen king by the citizens of London and a part of the Witan,[26] despite ongoing Danish efforts in wresting the crown from the West Saxons.\\r\\nFollowing the decisive Battle of Assandun on 18 October 1016, King Edmund signed a treaty with Cnut in which all of England except for Wessex would be controlled by Cnut.[28] Upon Edmund's death on 30 November, Cnut ruled the whole kingdom as its sole king.\\r\\nAfter Harthacnut, there was a brief Saxon Restoration between 1042 and 1066.\\r\\nIn 1066, several rival claimants to the English throne emerged. Among them were Harold Godwinson, elected king by the Witenagemot after the death of Edward the Confessor, as well as Harald Hardrada, King of Norway who claimed to be the rightful heir of Harthacnut, and Duke William II of Normandy, descendant of Rollo, founder of the royal House of Normandy, vassal to the King of France, and first cousin once-removed of Edward the Confessor. Harald and William both invaded separately in 1066. Godwinson successfully repelled the invasion by Hardrada, but ultimately lost the throne of England in the Norman conquest of England. After the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror made permanent the recent removal of the capital from Winchester to London. Following the death of Harold Godwinson on 14 October, the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemot elected as king Edgar the ?theling, the son of Edward the Exile and grandson of Edmund Ironside, but the young monarch was unable to resist the invaders and was never crowned. William was crowned King William I of England on Christmas Day 1066, in Westminster Abbey, and is today known as William the Conqueror, William the Bastard or William I.\\r\\nHenry I left no legitimate male heirs, his son William Adelin having died in the White Ship disaster. This ended the direct Norman line of kings in England. Henry named his eldest daughter, the dowager Empress Matilda as his heir. Before naming Matilda as heir, however, he had been in negotiations to name his nephew Stephen of Blois as his heir. When Henry died, Stephen invaded England, and in a coup d'etat had himself crowned instead of Matilda. The period which followed is known as The Anarchy, as parties supporting each side fought in open warfare on both Britain and on the continent for the better part of two decades.\\r\\nDisputed claimants\\r\\nEmpress Matilda was declared heir presumptive by her father, Henry I, after the death of her brother on the White Ship, and acknowledged as such by the barons. However, upon Henry I's death, the throne was seized by Matilda's cousin, Stephen of Blois. During the ensuing Anarchy, Matilda controlled England for a few months in 1141  the first woman so to do  but was never crowned and is rarely listed as a monarch of England.[36]\\r\\nCount Eustace IV of Boulogne (c. 1130 ÿ 17 August 1153) was appointed co-king of England by his father, King Stephen, on 6 April 1152, in order to guarantee his succession to the throne (as was the custom in France, but not in England). However, the Pope and the Church would not agree to this, and Eustace was not crowned. Eustace died the next year aged 23, during his father's lifetime, and so never became king in his own right.[38]\\r\\nStephen came to an agreement with Matilda in November 1153 with the signing of the Treaty of Wallingford, where Stephen recognised Prince Henry, son of Matilda and her second husband Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, as the heir-apparent to the throne in lieu of his own son, who had died that August. The royal house descended from Matilda and Geoffrey is widely known by two names, the House of Anjou (after Geoffrey's title as Count of Anjou) or the House of Plantagenet, after his sobriquet. Some historians prefer to group the subsequent kings into two groups, before and after the loss of the bulk of their French possessions, although they are not different royal houses.\\r\\nThe Angevins ruled over the Angevin Empire during the 12th and 13th centuries, an area stretching from the Pyrenees to Ireland. They did not regard England as their primary home until most of their continental domains were lost by John. Though the Angevin dynasty was short-lived, their male line descendants included the House of Plantagenet, the House of Lancaster and the House of York.\\r\\nThe Angevins formulated England's royal coat of arms, which usually showed other kingdoms held or claimed by them or their successors, although without representation of Ireland for quite some time. Dieu et mon droit has generally been used as the motto of English monarchs since being adopted by Edward III,[39] but it was first used as a battle cry by Richard I in 1198 at the Battle of Gisors, when he defeated the forces of Philip II of France, after which, he made it his motto.[39][40]\\r\\n(2) Isabella of Angoulme\\r\\nBordeaux Cathedral\\r\\n24 August 1200\\r\\nfive children\\r\\nHenry II named his son, another Henry (1155ÿ1183), as co-ruler with him. But this was a Norman custom of designating an heir, and Prince Henry did not outlive his father and rule in his own right, so he is not counted as a monarch on lists of kings.\\r\\nDisputed claimant\\r\\nLouis VIII of France briefly ruled about half of England from 1216 to 1217 at the conclusion of the First Barons' War against King John. On marching into London he was openly received by the rebel barons and citizens of London and proclaimed (though not crowned) king at St Paul's cathedral. Many nobles, including Alexander II of Scotland for his English possessions, gathered to give homage to him. However, in signing the Treaty of Lambeth in 1217, Louis conceded that he had never been the legitimate king of England.\\r\\nThe House of Plantagenet takes its name from Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, husband of the Empress Matilda and father of Henry II. The name Plantagenet itself was unknown as a family name per se until Richard of York adopted it as his family name in the 15th century. It has since been retroactively applied to English monarchs from Henry II onward. It is common among modern historians to refer to Henry II and his sons as the \\"Angevins\\" due to their vast continental Empire, and most of the Angevin kings before John spent more time in their continental possessions than in England. It is from the time of Henry III, after the loss of most of the family's continental possessions, that the Plantagenet kings became more English in nature. The Houses of Lancaster and York are cadet branches of the House of Plantagenet.\\r\\n(2) Margaret of France\\r\\n10 September 1299\\r\\nthree children\\r\\n(2) Isabella of Valois\\r\\nCalais\\r\\n4 November 1396\\r\\nNo children\\r\\nThis house descended from Edward III's third surviving son, John of Gaunt.

Those descended from English monarchs only through an illegitimate child would normally have no claim on the throne, but the situation was complicated when Gaunt and Swynford eventually married in 1396 (25 years after John Beaufort's birth). In view of the marriage, the church retroactively declared the Beauforts legitimate via a papal bull the same year (also enshrined in an Act of Parliament in 1397). A subsequent proclamation by John of Gaunt's legitimate son, King Henry IV, also recognised the Beauforts' legitimacy, but declared them ineligible ever to inherit the throne. Nevertheless, the Beauforts remained closely allied with Gaunt's other descendants, the Royal House of Lancaster.\\r\\nJohn Beaufort's granddaughter Lady Margaret Beaufort was married to Edmund Tudor. Tudor was the son of Welsh courtier Owain Tudur (anglicised to Owen Tudor) and Catherine of Valois, the widowed queen consort of the Lancastrian King Henry V. Edmund Tudor and his siblings were either illegitimate, or the product of a secret marriage, and owed their fortunes to the goodwill of their legitimate half-brother King Henry VI. When the House of Lancaster fell from power, the Tudors followed. By the late 15th century, the Tudors were the last hope for the Lancaster supporters. Edmund Tudor's son became king as Henry VII after defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses. King Henry married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, thereby uniting the Lancastrian and York lineages.\\r\\nWith Henry VIII's break from the Roman Catholic Church, the monarch became the Supreme Head of the Church of England and of the Church of Ireland. Elizabeth I's title became the Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\\r\\nDisputed claimant\\r\\nEdward VI named Lady Jane Grey as his heir presumptive, overruling the order of succession laid down by Parliament in the Third Succession Act. Four days after his death on 6 July 1553, Jane was proclaimed queenthe first of three Tudor women to be proclaimed queen regnant. Nine days after the proclamation, on 19 July, the Privy Council switched allegiance and proclaimed Edward VI's Catholic half-sister Mary. Jane was executed in 1554, aged 16. Many historians do not consider her to have been a legitimate monarch.\\r\\nUnder the terms of the marriage treaty between Philip I of Naples (Philip II of Spain from 15 January 1556) and Queen Mary I, Philip was to enjoy Mary's titles and honours for as long as their marriage should last. All official documents, including Acts of Parliament, were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. An Act of Parliament gave him the title of king and stated that he \\"shall aid her Highness? in the happy administration of her Grace's realms and dominions\\"[49] (although elsewhere the Act stated that Mary was to be \\"sole queen\\"). Nonetheless, Philip was to co-reign with his wife.[50] As the new King of England could not read English, it was ordered that a note of all matters of state should be made in Latin or Spanish.[50][51][52] Coins were minted showing the heads of both Mary and Philip, and the coat of arms of England (right) was impaled with Philip's to denote their joint reign.[53][54] Acts which made it high treason to deny Philip's royal authority were passed in England[55] and Ireland.[56] In 1555, Pope Paul IV issued a papal bull recognising Philip and Mary as rightful King and Queen of Ireland.\\r\\nFollowing the death of Elizabeth I in 1603 without issue, her first cousin twice removed, King James VI of Scotland, succeeded to the English throne as James I in the Union of the Crowns. James was descended from the Tudors through his great-grandmother, Margaret Tudor, the eldest daughter of Henry VII. In 1604, he adopted the title King of Great Britain. However, the two parliaments remained separate until the Acts of Union 1707.[57]\\r\\nNo monarch reigned between the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the Restoration of Charles II in 1660. Between 1649 and 1653, there was no single English head of state, as England was ruled directly by the Rump Parliament during a period known as the Commonwealth of England. After a coup d'etat in 1653, Oliver Cromwell forcibly took control of England from Parliament. He dissolved the Rump Parliament at the head of a military force and England entered a period known as The Protectorate, under the direct control of a single individual known as the Lord Protector. While not officially monarchs, the holder of the office of Lord was passed from Oliver Cromwell to his son Richard. Richard lacked both the ability to rule and confidence of the Army, and he was forcibly removed by the English Committee of Safety under the leadership of Charles Fleetwood in May 1659. England again lacked any single head of state during several months of conflict between Fleetwood's party and that of George Monck. Monck took control of the country in December 1659, and after almost a year of anarchy, the monarchy was formally restored when Charles II returned from France to accept the throne of England following the Declaration of Breda and an invitation to reclaim the throne from the Convention Parliament of 1660.\\r\\nAfter the Monarchy was restored, England came under the rule of Charles II, whose reign was relatively peaceful domestically, given the tumultuous time of the Interregnum years. Tensions still existed between Catholics and Protestants, however, and with the ascension of Charles's brother, the openly Catholic James II, England was again sent into a period of political turmoil. James II was ousted by Parliament less than three years after ascending to the throne, replaced by his daughter Mary II and her husband (also his nephew) William III during the Glorious Revolution. While James and his descendants would continue to claim the throne, all Catholics (such as James and his son Charles) were barred from the throne by the Act of Settlement 1701, enacted by Anne, another of James's Protestant daughters. After the Acts of Union 1707, England as a sovereign state ceased to exist, replaced by the new Kingdom of Great Britain.\\r\\n(2) Mary of Modena\\r\\nDover\\r\\n21 November 1673\\r\\nseven children\\r\\nThe Acts of Union 1707 were a pair of Parliamentary Acts passed during 1706 and 1707 by the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland to put into effect the Treaty of Union agreed on 22 July 1706. The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland (previously separate sovereign states, with separate legislatures but with the same monarch) into the Kingdom of Great Britain.[66]\\r\\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland had shared a monarch for more than a hundred years, since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones from his first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head. There had been attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689, to unite England and Scotland by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early eighteenth century that the idea had the support of both political establishments behind it, albeit for rather different reasons.\\r\\nFor monarchs after 1707, see List of British monarchs.\\r\\nThe standard title for all monarchs from ?thelstan until the time of King John was Rex Anglorum (\\"King of the English\\"). In addition, many of the pre-Norman kings assumed extra titles, as follows:\\r\\nIn the Norman period Rex Anglorum remained standard, with occasional use of Rex Anglie (\\"King of England\\"). The Empress Matilda styled herself Domina Anglorum (\\"Lady of the English\\").\\r\\nFrom the time of King John onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of Rex or Regina Anglie.\\r\\nIn 1604 James I, who had inherited the English throne the previous year, adopted the title (now usually rendered in English rather than Latin) King of Great Britain. The English and Scottish parliaments, however, did not recognise this title until the Acts of Union of 1707 under Queen Anne (who was of course Queen of Great Britain rather than king).[67]","input":"Who was the first king of all of england?"},{"output":"the high concentration of volcanoes in the area","context":"Due to the geological location of Iceland (over a rift in continental plates), the high concentration of volcanoes in the area is often an advantage in the generation of geothermal energy, the heating and making of electricity.[1] During winter, pavements near these areas (such as Reykjavik and Akureyri) are heated up.\\r\\nFive major geothermal power plants exist in Iceland, which produce approximately 26.2% (2010)[2] of the nation's electricity.

The first, Thanos: The Infinity Revelation, was released the following August.[7][8] Beginning in February 2015, Starlin also penned a four-issue miniseries titled Thanos vs. Hulk, which was set prior to the graphic novels. The second installment in the trilogy, Thanos: The Infinity Relativity, was released in June, 2015.[9] The third graphic novel, Thanos: The Infinity Finale, as well as the connected mini-series The Infinity Entity were published in 2016.[10]\\r\\nAt the same time Starlin was writing these graphic novels and tie-ins, the character also appeared in New Avengers #23ÿ24 (OctÿNov 2014),[11] Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, #18ÿ20 (OctÿDec 2014), Legendary Star-Lord #4 (Dec 2014), a six-issue miniseries titled Thanos: A God Up There Listening (Dec 2014), Avengers vol. 5, #40ÿ41 (MarÿApr 2015), and Deadpool vol. 3, #45 (\\"#250\\") (Jun 2015). Thanos also played a major role in the five-issue miniseries The Infinity Guantlet vol. 2, (July 2015 ÿ Jan 2016), a tie-in of the cross-over Secret Wars (2015).\\r\\nThanos was born on Saturn's moon Titan as the son of Eternals Mentor and Sui-San, and his brother is Eros of Titan, also known as Starfox. Thanos carries the Deviants gene, and as such, shares the physical appearance of the Eternals' cousin race. At birth, his mother was shocked by his appearance and attempted to kill him, due to believing that her son would annihilate all life in the universe, but was stopped by A'Lars, Thanos' father. During his school years, Thanos was a pacifist[12] and would only play with his brother Eros (Starfox) and pets. By adolescence, Thanos had become fascinated with nihilism and death, worshipping and eventually falling in love with the physical embodiment of death, Mistress Death.[13] As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers through his superior scientific knowledge. He also attempted to create a new life for himself by siring many children as well as becoming a pirate. He finds no fulfillment in either until he is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his offspring and his pirate captain.[14]\\r\\nWishing to impress Mistress Death, Thanos gathers an army of villainous aliens and begins a nuclear bombardment of Titan that kills millions of his race.[15] Seeking universal power in the form of the Cosmic Cube, Thanos travels to Earth. Prior to landing, his vessel destroys a nearby car as a family witnesses his arrival.[16] Unbeknownst to Thanos, two of the family members in the vehicle survive: the father's spirit is preserved by the Titanian cosmic entity Kronos and is given a new form as Drax the Destroyer while the daughter is found by Thanos' father, Mentor, and is raised to become the heroine Moondragon. Thanos eventually locates the Cube, and also attracts the attention of Mistress Death. Willing the Cube to make him omnipotent, Thanos then discards the Cube. He imprisons Kronos and taunts Kree hero Captain Marvel, who, with the aid of superhero team the Avengers and ISAAC (a super-computer based on Titan), is eventually able to defeat Thanos by destroying the Cube.[17]\\r\\nThanos later comes to the aid of Adam Warlock in a war against the Magus and his religious empire.[18][19] During this alliance Thanos cultivates a plan to reunite with Mistress Death, and secretly siphons off the energies of Warlock's Soul Gem, combining these with the power of the other Infinity Gems to create a weapon capable of destroying a star. Warlock summons the Avengers and Captain Marvel to stop Thanos, although the plan is foiled when Thanos kills Warlock. The Titan regroups and captures the heroes, who are freed by Spider-Man and the Thing. Thanos is finally stopped by Warlock, whose spirit emerges from the Soul Gem and turns the Titan to stone.[15][20] Thanos's spirit eventually reappears to accompany a dying Captain Marvel's soul into the realm of Death.[21]\\r\\nThanos is eventually resurrected,[22] and collects the Infinity Gems once again.[23] He uses the gems to create the Infinity Gauntlet, making himself omnipotent, and erases half the living things in the universe to prove his love to Death.[24] This act and several other acts are soon undone by Adam Warlock.[25] Warlock reveals that Thanos has always allowed himself to be defeated because the Titan secretly knows he is not worthy of ultimate power. Thanos joins Warlock as part of the Infinity Watch and helps him to defeat first his evil[26] and then good[27] personas, and cure Thor of \\"warrior Madness\\".[28]\\r\\nThanos later recruits a team of Earth-bound super-villains and puts them under the field leadership of Geatar in a mission to capture an ancient robot containing the obscure knowledge of a universal library and extract its data.[29] Thanos uses information from the robot to plot against and battle Tyrant, the first creation of Galactus turned destroyer.[30] When trapped in an alternate dimension, Thanos employs the aid of the brother of Ka-Zar, Parnival Plunder[31] and later the Hulk[32] to escape, although both attempts are unsuccessful. Thanos is eventually freed and comes into conflict with Thor, aligning himself with Mangog in a scheme to obtain powerful mystical and cosmic talismans which will allow him to destroy all life in the universe,[33] and during their battles Thanos decimates the planet Rigel-3.[34]\\r\\nThanos then uses the heroes Thor and Genis-Vell (Captain Marvel's son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected.[35] Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new pantheon of gods created by himself. Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers' former member Mantis and her son Quoi, who apparently is destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the \\"Rot\\", a cosmic aberration in deep space caused by Thanos's incessant love for Death.[36] Thanos also once conducted extensive research on genetics, and after studying many of the universe's heroes and villains cloned them and gene-spliced his own DNA into the subjects. Although he later abandons the project, five clones survive, being versions of Professor X, Iron Man, Gladiator, Doctor Strange, and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed the incarnations of Thanos encountered in the past by Thor and Ka-Zar were actually clones. The true Thanos?ÿ with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange?ÿ destroys the remaining clones.[37]\\r\\nWhen the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten uses a source of cosmic power, the Heart of the Universe, to seize power in present-day Earth (killing most of Earth's heroes in the process), Thanos uses a time-travel stratagem to defeat him. Thanos then uses the Heart of the Universe to reverse Akhenaten's actions and was also compelled to correct a flaw in the universe. Changed by the experience, Thanos advises confidant Adam Warlock he will no longer seek universal conquest.[38]\\r\\nThanos decides to atone for the destruction of Rigel-3, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it. During the course of this mission Thanos learns Galactus is collecting the Infinity Gems in an effort to end his unyielding hunger. Thanos later learns Galactus is being manipulated into releasing a multiversal threat called Hunger, which feeds on entire universes. Despite opposition from Thanos, Galactus unwittingly frees the entity, and when its intentions are revealed, the pair team up and attempt to destroy it.[39]\\r\\nEn route to the Kyln, an intergalactic prison, Thanos meets Death, who for the first time speaks to the Titan. Death claims to be worth wooing, but says Thanos must offer something other than death. At the Kyln Thanos encounters Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord, and the Shi'ar warrior Gladiator, who are both prisoners, and the Beyonder, who has been rendered amnesiac by its choice to assume a humanoid female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder, causing its mind to shut down and leaving its power trapped within a comatose physical form. Thanos then instructs the Kyln officers to keep the Beyonder on life support indefinitely in order to prevent the entity from being reborn.[40] Thanos departs the Kyln in the company of Skreet, a chaos-mite freed from the prison. Thanos then meets the Fallen, revealed to be the true first Herald of Galactus. Thanos defeats the former Herald and places him under complete mental control.[41] He later appears in Wisconsin attempting to charge a weapon called the Pyramatrix with the life force of everyone on Earth until he is defeated by Squirrel Girl. After the battle, Uatu the Watcher appears and confirms to Squirrel Girl that she defeated the real Thanos, not a clone or copy.[42]\\r\\nDuring the Annihilation War Thanos allies himself with the genocidal villain Annihilus. When the Annihilation Wave destroys the Kyln, Thanos sends the Fallen to check on the status of the Beyonder, whose mortal form he finds has perished. Before the Fallen can report back to Thanos it encounters Tenebrous and Aegis: two of Galactus's ancient foes. Thanos convinces Tenebrous and Aegis to join the Annihilation Wave in order to get revenge on Galactus, and they subsequently defeat the World Devourer and the Silver Surfer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus. Once Thanos learns Annihilus's true goal is to use the Power Cosmic to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor, he decides to free Galactus. Drax the Destroyer kills Thanos before he can do so but discovers that Thanos had placed a failsafe device to allow Silver Surfer to free Galactus in the event that Annihilus betrayed him.[43] During a climactic battle with Annihilus, Nova is near death and sees Thanos standing with Mistress Death.[44]\\r\\nA cocoon protected by the Universal Church of Truth is revealed to be hiding Thanos, who has been chosen by Oblivion to be the new Avatar of Death.[45] Resurrected before his mind could be fully formed, Thanos goes on a mindless rampage before being captured by the Guardians of the Galaxy.[46] Thanos pretends to aid the Guardians against the invading Cancerverse, and after discovering its origin kills an alternate version of Mar-Vell, the self-proclaimed Avatar of Life. This causes the collapse of the Cancerverse, and Nova sacrifices himself in an attempt to contain Thanos inside the imploding reality.[47] Thanos escapes[48] and returns to Earth seeking an artificial cosmic cube. He forms an incarnation of the criminal group Zodiac to retrieve it, but he is defeated by the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy and remanded to the custody of the Elders of the Universe.[49]\\r\\nThanos soon invades Earth again after being informed that most of the Avengers have temporarily left the planet.[50] He launches an assault on Attilan, which he offers to spare in exchange for the deaths of all Inhumans between the ages of 16 and 22. Black Bolt later informs the Illuminati that the true purpose of the invasion is to find and kill Thane, an Eternal/Inhuman hybrid that Thanos had secretly fathered years earlier.[51] Thanos is trapped in a pocket limbo of stasis by his son.[52] Thanos is freed by Namor and was among the villains that joined his Cabal to destroy other worlds.[53] Thanos later meets his end on Battleworld, where he is easily killed by God Emperor Doom during an attempted insurrection.[54]\\r\\nThanos is unintentionally brought back to life by Galactus.[55] When Thanos prepares to raid a Project Pegasus facility to steal a Cosmic Cube, he is ambushed and defeated by a team of Avengers. During their battle, he mortally wounds War Machine and critically injures She-Hulk.[56][57][58] After his defeat, he is imprisoned in the Triskelion,[59] and manipulates Anti-Man into facilitating his escape.[60] Thanos goes on a killing spree, but Black Panther, Blue Marvel and Monica Rambeau are able to stop him by devising a device that blocks the electrical synapses in his brain.[61]\\r\\nThanos somehow later recovers and escapes captivity, and reclaims his Black Order forces from Corvus Glaive. After retaking command of his Black Quadrant outpost, Thanos discovers that he is dying.[62] Thanos tries to force Mentor to find a cure for his malady, but kills him when he is unable to.[63] Soon after Thanos would be battered and detained by the Shi'ar Imperial Guard after he invaded the very planet station of his fathers facility sitting in their territory.[64] A quick jump into the future shows Thanos' estranged son Thane having bested his mad father with the personification of death at his side.[65]\\r\\nPresently locked within a maximum security cosmic Alcatraz, Thanos sits alone within a cell as his sickness ravages his body. All while being mocked by its prison warden whom he lured into a false sense of security in order to escape; ripping off his arm for escape access and murdering half his personal staff in a bid for freedom.[66] Having narrowly escaped his imprisonment before its self-destruction, Thanos retreats to a hidden outpost where a roving mercenary colony loyal only to him was once stationed. Only to find it decimated at the hand of the new lover of Mistress Death; who reveals that she'd stricken her former avatar with his fatal sickness, being his son Thane, now boasting the power of the Phoenix Force. Whom under her coaxing, had banished the mad titan back to the decimated Moon of Titan now entirely stripped of his godlike powers.[67]\\r\\nFor the next few months, Thanos would survive alone and all but powerless in the ruins of his home city. Surviving off the flesh of mutated vermin and being accosted by local scavengers who preyed upon him in his weakened condition, he is soon picked up by the unlikely crew of Thane's betrayed cohorts Tryco Slatterus, his adopted daughter Nebula and his brother Eros of Titan.[68] Having heard of their plight, the three were dismayed to find Thanos stripped of all he was and had ever been; his second daughter only agreeing to come along so she could kill her father, immediately assaulted him.[volume?&?issue?needed]\\r\\nStarfox was able to preempt her attempt at patricide while inviting his wayward tyrant of a brother aboard their vessel. Thanos mentioned the only way for him to be relived of his mortality was to seek out the God Quarry heralded by The Witches of Infinity. Starfox initially wrote this off as fable and folklore. Now on the path to the cosmic coven set at the edge of the known universe, Thanos and crew stop short of a black hole, knowing full well that it is where the witches make their home. The Mad Titan jumps into the pinhole of nothingness alongside his brother, whom not trusting his butcherous sibling with the supposed infinite power of said collective; having survived the crushing force of the singularity they dove into, Thanos and Eros are greeted by the Coven at the godly graveyard.[69]\\r\\nThanos demands the three that are one to return his godhood to him. Starfox tries his best charm the enchantresses only to be rebuked by them, much to Thanos's joy when they prematurely aged him. Seeing as it was neither their place to destroy nor turn away those seeking them, The Witches profess the only way for the warlord to be made whole again was to climb down into the God Quarry and await a trial that would test his soul. Immediately after setting foot within the graveyard of old gods, Thanos is subsumed into the bedrock within which they rest.[70]\\r\\nAs his journey of the core being commenced, Thanos's trial began with him as leader of earth and the universes greatest champions, the Avengers. But he's unable to escape the nagging feeling he's forgotten something, till the quarry itself wearing the guise of Falcon reminds him of who he used to be; tempting him to live as a hero and a man at peace for the first time in his immortal life. But Thanos laughs maniacally as he coldly rebukes such a path, ruthlessly killing his would be friends and allies while choosing to remain whom he always was. His cosmic might returned to him, Thanos is freed from the God Quarry, wherein he immediately accosts his brother Eros and threatens the coven to release him from their domain so that he might do away with Thane once and for all.[71]\\r\\nAround the time of the New Thor's appearance, Thanos is approached by a mysterious hooded woman, who proposes an alliance. He tasks her with bringing him the hammer of the deceased Ultimate Thor.[72] The woman fails, but removes her disguise to reveal herself as Hela, the Norse goddess of death. She tells Thanos that she needs his help to reclaim Hel, and in exchange, offers to give him the one thing he has been searching for his entire life: death. After this, the two kiss.[73]\\r\\nThanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the Titanian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, but amplified to a higher degree through a combination of his mutantÿEternal heritage, bionic amplification, mysticism, and power bestowed by the abstract entity, Death. Demonstrating enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, immortality and invulnerability among other qualities, Thanos can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy, and is capable of telekinesis and telepathy. He can manipulate matter and live indefinitely without food, air or water, cannot die of old age, is immune to all terrestrial diseases, and has high resistance to psychic assaults. Thanos is also an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the art of war on Titan.\\r\\nThanos has proven himself capable of briefly holding his own in battle against Odin,[74] and of blasting Galactus off his feet.[75]\\r\\nThanos is a supergenius in virtually all known fields of advanced science and has created technology far exceeding that which is found on contemporary Earth. He often employs a transportation chair capable of space flight, force field projection, teleportation, time travel, and movement through alternate universes. Thanos is also a master strategist and uses several space vessels, at least three under the name \\"Sanctuary\\", as a base of operations.\\r\\nDuring the 1996 Amalgam Comics crossover between DC Comics and Marvel, Thanos merged with Darkseid to become \\"Thanoseid\\".[76]\\r\\nIn the alternate universe limited series Earth X, Thanos dwelled in the Realm of the Dead with the entity Death.[77] It is revealed his mother was a Skrull and Death used her secret to make him believe that Death was his mother. When the deception is revealed, he uses the Ultimate Nullifier on Death.[78]\\r\\nThe Ultimate Marvel imprint title Ultimate Fantastic Four features an alternate universe version of Thanos who is the ruler of Acheron (and has a son called Ronan the Accuser, who is in possession of a Cosmic Cube[79]), a vast empire consisting of thousands of worlds on another plane of existence.[80]\\r\\nThanos features in the limited series Marvel Zombies 2, set in the alternate universe of Earth-2149. Having been \\"zombified\\", the character is killed by the cosmic-powered Hulk after an altercation over food.[81]\\r\\nA number of the stories featuring Thanos have been republished into trade paperbacks and other collected editions:\\r\\nThanos was ranked number 47 on IGN's top 100 comic book villains of all time,[110] 22nd on Wizard's Top 100 Greatest Villains list,[citation needed] and number 21 on Complex's 25 Greatest Comic Book Villains List.[111]","input":"When does thanos first appear in marvel movies?"},{"output":"Edgar Amos Love","context":"Omega Psi Phi (ζ) is an international fraternity with over 750 undergraduate and graduate chapters. The fraternity was founded on November 17, 1911 by three Howard University juniors, Edgar Amos Love, Oscar James Cooper and Frank Coleman, and their faculty adviser, Dr. Ernest Everett Just. Omega Psi Phi is the first predominantly African-American fraternity to be founded at a historically black university.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its founding in 1911, Omega Psi Phi's stated purpose has been to attract and build a strong and effective force of men dedicated to its Cardinal Principles of manhood, scholarship, perseverance, and uplift. Throughout the world, many notable members are recognized as leaders in the arts, academics, athletics, entertainment, business, civil rights, education, government, and science fields. A few notable members include Bill Cosby, Samuel M. Nabrit, Walter E. Massey, Benjamin Mays, Bayard Rustin, Langston Hughes, Count Basie, Roy Wilkins, Benjamin Hooks, Vernon Jordan, Dr. Robert Henry Lawrence, Jr., Malcolm Jenkins, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rev.

Woodson, the fraternity launched Negro History and Literature Week in an effort to publicize the growing body of scholarship on African-American history.[3] Encouraged by public interest, the event was renamed \\"Negro Achievement Week\\" in 1925 and given an expanded national presence in 1926 by Woodson's Association for the Study of Negro Life as \\"Negro History Week.\\"[3] Expanded to the full month of February from 1976, this event continues today as Black History Month.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1945, the fraternity has undertaken a National Social Action Program to meet the needs of African Americans in the areas of health, housing, civil rights, and education. Omega Psi Phi has been a patron of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) since 1955, providing an annual gift of $350,000.00 to the program.\\r\\n\\r\\nOmega Psi Phi is a member of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), which is composed of nine predominately African-American Greek-letter sororities and fraternities that promote interaction through forums, meetings, and other media for the exchange of information, and engage in cooperative programming and initiatives throughout the world.

Drew Scholarship Program encourages academic progress among the organization's undergraduate members. A portion of the fraternity's budget is designated for the Charles R. Drew Scholarship Commission, which awards scholarships to members and non-members.\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial Action Programs ÿ All chapters are required to participate in programs that uplift their society. Many participate in activities like: voter registration, illiteracy programs, mentoring programs, fundraisers, and charitable organizations such as American Diabetes Association, United Way, and the Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalent Hunt Program ÿ Each chapter is required to hold a yearly talent contest, to encourage young people to expose themselves to the Performing Arts.

For the graduate chapter, an applicant must already possess a bachelor's degree.[7] The fraternity grants honorary membership to men who have contributed to society in a positive way on a national or international level. For example, Charles Young (March 12, 1864 ÿ January 2, 1922) was the third African American graduate of West Point, the first black U.S. national park superintendent, the first African American military attach, and the highest ranking black officer (Colonel) in the United States Army until his death in 1922.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1930, Omega Psi Phi became one of 5 founding members of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC).

They are currently the third longest regularly scheduled non-stop commercial flights in the world as measured by distance[b]13,804 kilometres (8,577?mi; 7,454?nmi), which is over one third of the distance around Earth.[c] Both flights are operated with Airbus A380 aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQantas and American Airlines (AA) were two of the co-founding members of the Oneworld airline alliance, which was launched in 1999. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) has long been American's headquarters and largest hub and is centrally located in the United States. Dallas is less than four hours from all cities in the continental United States and AA serves more of these airports from DFW than from Los Angeles, Qantas's main gateway to the United States. Los Angeles is also an AA hub, but is significantly smaller in terms of departures and destinations and located 4-5 hours from most east coast cities. In 2012, American operated nearly 500 departing flights daily from DFW, but fewer than 100 from Los Angeles.[2] Dallas would be a logical destination for Qantas to serve, but it only had six aircraft with the 13,804 kilometres (8,577?mi) range needed to reach Dallas and they were needed for the Melbourne-Los Angeles and Sydney-Buenos Aires routes. The Boeing 747-400ER has a range of 14,205 kilometres (8,827?mi),[3] although winds aloft and fuel needed for holding can trim that figure.\\r\\nQantas had studied the feasibility of the Dallas route for years.[4] At the time of the Great Recession, Qantas' Sydney-San Francisco service became unprofitable, while an open skies agreement between Australia & the US flooded the market with more capacity.[4][5] In the meantime, the Boeing 747-400ER aircraft were replaced with A380s on the Melbourne-LA route. According to Qantas CEO Alan Joyce: \\"a lot of things clicked on this and it made absolute sense for us to devote aircraft resources to this destination.\\"[4] By flying to Dallas, Qantas can offer passengers a 70-minute connection to domestic flights, which means onwards connections to cities like New York City, Chicago, Boston, and Miami can be up to two hours faster than transiting through Los Angeles.[4] At launch, Qantas had codeshare agreements on 54 AA flights from DFW to cities in the US, Canada, & Mexico.[6] When announcing the launch of A380 service, Qantas notes that DFW offers more than 30 codeshare destinations beyond the network available from Los Angeles.[7] According to Qantas in 2014, the most popular destinations for connections with QF7 are Orlando, Boston, Houston, and New York's LaGuardia Airport.[8]\\r\\nQantas began operating the Sydney-Dallas routedesignated Flight 7 outbound and Flight 8 returningon 16 May 2011.[6][9] The route was initially flown 4 times weekly,[6] but was upgraded to daily service on 1 July 2012.[10] Flight 7, from Sydney to Dallas, flew non-stop in 15 hr 25 min.[6] Due to strong headwinds, Flight 8 could not be flown non-stop and flew from Dallas to Brisbane Airport before returning to Sydney.[11] Flights 7 & 8 were operated with a Boeing 747-400ER aircraft from 2011 until 28 September 2014.\\r\\nWhen launched, Flight 7 was the longest regularly scheduled non-stop flight by distance operated with a Boeing 747[6][12] and the third-longest regularly scheduled non-stop commercial flight by distance[b]behind Singapore Airlines Flights 21/22 (Newark-Singapore; 15,345?km) and Singapore Airlines Flights 37/38 (Los Angeles-Singapore; 14,114?km). However, unlike the Qantas Boeing 747-400ER, the Singapore Airlines flights were flown with Airbus A340-500 aircraft configured with an all-business class cabin that carried only 100 passengers.[13]\\r\\nQantas Flight 7 became the second-longest regularly-scheduled non-stop commercial flight by distance when Singapore Airlines stopped flying non-stop between Singapore & Los Angeles on 20 October 2013. The final Singapore Airlines flight from Newark to Singapore departed 23 November 2013, at which point Qantas Flight 7 became the longest regularly scheduled non-stop flight by distance.[b][14][15] It held this distinction until 1 March 2016, when Emirates began a 14,203?km non-stop service, EK 448 and EK 449, between Auckland, New Zealand and Dubai, UAE.[16]\\r\\nThe route suffered some setbacks during the first two weeks of operation, which called into question the feasibility of the route.[17][18][19] On 21 May 2011, less than a week after commencing operations on the route, Qantas offloaded three containers of luggage in Dallas in order to reach Brisbane without the need to make an unplanned stop for fuel. Affected passengers waited 24 hours for their luggage to arrive via Los Angeles. Qantas claimed they were forced to make the decision \\"due to load restrictions as a result of unseasonably strong winds.\\"[18] On 23 May, Flight 7 was forced to divert to Houston because it lacked enough fuel to circle Dallas until thunderstormstypical during summertimecleared, resulting in a two-hour delay.[19] Then on 30 May, Flight 8 made an unplanned stop in Noumea, New Caledonia, when its pilots decided it was safer to stop and refuel there than continue on to Brisbane.[19][20]\\r\\nIn May 2014, Qantas announced that Flight 7 and Flight 8 would be operated by the Airbus A380 beginning 29 September 2014, at which point Flight 8's intermediate stop in Brisbane would be terminated. Although frequency will be reduced from seven to six flights per week, the larger capacity of the A380 results in an increase in weekly capacity on the route of more than ten percent. The A380s are configured into four classes, and brings the addition of first class to the route.[7]\\r\\nThe first A380 aircraft to operate Flight 7/8 sported a special livery: the kangaroo painted on the aircraft's empennage (tail) wore a white cowboy hat and star-speckled blue kerchief around its neck. The hat and kerchief pay homage to the Dallas region's strong association with cowboy culture and the red background, white kangaroo/hat, and star-speckled blue are suggestive of the US flag.[8] With the change in aircraft, Qantas became the first airline to operate an A380 at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, although Emirates began A380 to DFW just 2 days later.[21]\\r\\nQantas Flight 7 operates from Sydney Airport (IATA: SYD) near Sydney, New South Wales, Australia to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (IATA: DFW) near the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth in Texas, USA. Qantas Flight 8 is the return flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to Sydney. Through a codeshare agreement with American Airlines, these flights are marketed as American Airlines Flight 7308 (AA7308)[22] and American Airlines Flight 7375 (AA 7375),[23] respectively. It is the only non-stop route between Australia and a US city beyond the west coast (Los Angeles or San Francisco).[10] The flights originally operated six times weekly (every day except Tuesday)[7] but moved to daily flights from April 2016[24]. The A380 aircraft initially deployed on this route are configured in a 4-class seating with a 14-seat first class cabin, a 64-seat business class cabin, a 35-seat premium economy cabin, and a 371-seat economy class cabin.[25]\\r\\nBecause of the difference in local times, Flight 7 departs Sydney, Flight 7 arrives in Dallas/Fort Worth, and Flight 8 departs Dallas/Fort Worth on the same day (local time). Since Flight 8 is both an overnight flight and crosses the International Date Line, it arrives in Sydney two days after departing Dallas/Fort Worth. For example, Flights 7/8 departing Sydney on 29 September 2014 is scheduled to fly (local times in bold):\\r\\nFor the period beginning 29 September 2014 through 4 April 2015: Flight 7 is scheduled for 15 hr 25 min (26 October to 28 March) or 15 hr 35 min (until 25 October & from 29 March).[26] while Flight 8 is scheduled for 16 hr 50 min (26 October to 28 March) or 16 hr 55 min (until 25 October & from 29 March).[27] The route is flown daily starting from 29 April 2016.[24]\\r\\nQantas Flight 8 from Dallas to Sydneywith a scheduled duration of 16 hours, 50 minutesis one of the longest regularly scheduled non-stop commercial flights by scheduled duration.[citation needed]","input":"How long is the flight from dfw to sydney?"},{"output":"the National Honor Society of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA)","context":"The Order of the Arrow (OA) is the National Honor Society of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). The society was created by E. Urner Goodman, with the assistance of Carroll A. Edson, in 1915 as a means of reinforcing the Scout Oath and the Scout Law. It uses American Indian imagery for ceremonies bestowing recognition on Scouts elected by their peers as best exemplifying the ideals of Scouting. The OA promotes Scouting ideals, especially selfless leadership to help others, as lifelong values and encourages continued participation in Scouting and camping.\\r\\nInfluenced in part by Scout camp customs, and in part by Native American traditions and folklore, the OA uses \\"safeguarded\\" symbols, handshakes, and ceremonies to impart a sense of community. Some Native Americans have supported the OA's inclusion of Native American elements in its practices and have recognized the OA as positively promoting their culture,[7][8] and some Native Americans have criticized the OA's adoption of elements of their culture as inauspicious cultural appropriation.[9][10]\\r\\nInducted members, known as Arrowmen or Brothers, are organized into local youth-led lodges that harbor fellowship, promote camping, and render service to Boy Scout councils and their communities. Members wear identifying insignia on their uniforms, most notably the OA pocket flap that represents their individual OA lodge and the OA sash worn at official OA functions. The OA program sponsors several events, awards, and training functions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1915, E. Urner Goodman, a newly hired field executive for the Philadelphia Council, was assigned to serve as director of the council's summer camp at Treasure Island Scout Reservation on the Delaware River. He believed that the summer camp experience should do more than just teach proficiency in Scoutcraft skills; rather, the principles embodied in the Scout Oath and Scout Law should become realities in the lives of Scouts. Along with his assistant camp director, Carroll A. Edson, he started an experimental program, Wimachtendienk (\\"Brotherhood\\" in the Lenape language), to recognize those Scouts best exemplifying those traits as an example to their peers.[11][12]\\r\\nGoodman and Edson decided that a \\"camp fraternity\\" was the way to improve the summer camp experience and to encourage older Scouts to continue attending Scout summer camp. In developing this program they borrowed from the traditions and practices of several other organizations. Edward Cave's Boy's Camp Book (1914) was consulted for the concept of a camp society that would perpetuate camp traditions.[13] College fraternities were also influential for their concepts of brotherhood and rituals, and the idea of new members pledging themselves to the new organization.[14][15] Inspired by Ernest Thompson Seton's previous Woodcraft Indians program, American Indian lore was used to make the organization interesting and appealing to youth.[16][17] Other influences include the Brotherhood of Andrew and Phillip, a Presbyterian church youth group with which Goodman had been involved as a young man, and Freemasonry.\\r\\nThe traditions and rituals of Freemasonry contributed more to the basic structure of the OA ritual than any other organization. In fact, there appears to be no known fraternal organization more faithful in form to Freemasonry than the OA. Familiar terms such as \\"lodge\\" and \\"obligation\\" were borrowed from Masonic practice, as were most of the ceremonial structures and ritual formulae. Even the early national meeting was called a \\"Grand Lodge,\\" a Masonic reference.[18][19][20][14][15] Of course, despite several factsthe common intent to impart a sense of obligation to a higher moral authority; that groups such as OA that employ these rituals share many of the moral precepts; and even that there are historical connections to the founders of OA and other organizations to Freemasonrynothing should imply any political connection to Freemasonry itself.\\r\\nGoodman and Edson ultimately devised a program where troops chose, at the summer camp's conclusion, those boys from among their number who best exemplified the ideals of Scouting. Those elected were acknowledged as having displayed, in the eyes of their fellow Scouts, a spirit of unselfish service and brotherhood. Edson helped Goodman research the traditions and language of the Lenni Lenapealso known as the Delawarewho previously had inhabited Treasure Island.[21] The brotherhood of Scout honor campers with its American Indian overtones was a success and was repeated again the following summer at Treasure Island. Those Scouts honored at Treasure Island in 1915 and 1916 would become members of what is now Unami Lodge.[22]\\r\\nBy 1921, Goodman had spoken to Scout leaders in surrounding states about the honor society, which resulted in multiple lodges being established by Scout councils in the northeastern United States.[11] The name of the society was changed to Order of the Arrow, and in October 1921, Goodman convened the first national meeting of what at that time was called the \\"National Lodge of the Order of the Arrow\\" in Philadelphiawhere Goodman was elected as Grand Chieftain.[23] Committees were organized to formulate a constitution, refine ceremonial rituals, devise insignia, and plan future development.\\r\\nIn the early 1920s, many Scout executives were skeptical of what they called \\"secret camp fraternities.\\" By September 1922, opposition to the Order of the Arrow was such that a formal resolution opposing \\"camp fraternities\\" was proposed at a national meeting of Scout executives. Goodman argued against the motion: \\"Using the Scout ideals as our great objective\\", he said, a camp activity that will \\"further the advancement of those ideals\\" should not be suppressed.[24] The motion was narrowly defeated, and the fledgling Order continued as an experimental program throughout the 1920s and 1930s. In 1931, there were OA lodges in 7 percent of BSA councils nationwide. By 1948, about two-thirds of the BSA's councils had established OA lodges.[24] That year, the OA was also integrated as an official part of the Scouting program.[25][26]\\r\\n? E. Urner Goodman[11]\\r\\nOver the century since the Order of the Arrow's founding, more than one million Scouts and Scouters have worn the OA sash on their uniforms, denoting membership in the Brotherhood. The four stated purposes of the Order of the Arrow are: \\"(1) Recognize those who best exemplify the Scout Oath and Law in their daily lives and through that recognition cause others to conduct themselves in a way that warrants similar recognition; (2) Promote camping, responsible outdoor adventure, and environmental stewardship as essential components of every Scouts experience, in the unit, year-round, and in summer camp; (3) Develop leaders with the willingness, character, spirit and ability to advance the activities of their units, our Brotherhood, Scouting, and ultimately our nation; and (4) Crystallize the Scout habit of helpfulness into a life purpose of leadership in cheerful service to others.[27]\\r\\nIn a new program of national service conducted from June through August 2008, the OA offered ArrowCorps5 to both youth and adult Arrowmen.[28] Described as \\"one of the largest conservation efforts in Scouting's history\\" by the Boy Scouts of America, approximately 3,500 Arrowmen converged on five national forests to work on various conservation projects such as building new trails and helping preserve nearly extinct species, as well as removing invasive species, in cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service.[29] The five national forests are: Mark Twain National Forest, Manti-La Sal National Forest, George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, Shasta-Trinity National Forest and Bridger-Teton National Forest.[30]\\r\\nMore than 171,000 youth and adults are members of the Order of the Arrow. This number is approximately one-seventh of the total number of those registered in the BSA.[31] Youth members are elected by their local unit. In contrast to Boy Scouting, where youth members are under 18 and adult members are over 18, OA youth members include all persons under 21?years of age while those 21 and over are considered adult members.[32]\\r\\nThe OA is a part of the Boy Scout program. Youth members are elected by Boy Scout troops and Varsity Scout teams. To be eligible for induction, a Scout must have achieved the rank of First Class, spent at least 15 days and nights camping within the last two years (six of which at a resident camp), and gain the approval of their unit leader. Once elected, a youth must complete their Ordeal within one year. Adults who had not previously joined the Order as a youth member may become members by being nominated by the unit, district, or council committee and then approved by the lodge adult selection committee. Adults must meet the same camping requirement. In addition, at least one youth from the adult's troop or team must be elected to the OA in that year for an adult to be nominated.[11] A unit may nominate up to one-third of the number of adults as the number of youth elected. Honorary membership was once bestowed in special circumstances, as with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower, but this practice was officially discontinued in 1953.[33]\\r\\nWhile the Order permits initiation of adult women leaders, there has been no decision made as yet as to whether or not girls will be eligible for election and induction, following their scheduled official incorporation into the Boy Scout program in February of 2019 (which will then be re-named \\"Scouts BSA\\").\\r\\nAfter being elected or nominated, candidates may participate in a call-out ceremony to recognize those Scouts and Scouters that were selected before they attend their Ordeal. The call-out ceremony may be performed at summer camp, a camporee, a call-out weekend or at a unit meeting. Candidates subsequently participate in an Ordeal, intended to emphasize service and selflessness. During the induction, \\"candidates maintain complete silence, receive small amounts of food, work on camp improvement projects, and are required to sleep alone, apart from other campers, which teaches significant values.\\"[34] If they succeed in their ordeal the candidates are then welcomed as Ordeal members in a formal Ordeal Ceremony.[35][36]\\r\\nOrdeal members are entitled to all the same rights and privileges of membership in the Order as Brotherhood and Vigil Honor membersthere are no ranks within the Order. However, moving on to Brotherhood membership offers an opportunity to reaffirm one's commitment to the Order. Arrowmen may \\"seal\\" their membership after ten months by demonstrating their knowledge of the traditions and obligations of the OA. They then participate in an induction ceremony and become Brotherhood members.[11]\\r\\nWhile the Ordeal consists primarily of physical impressions, \\"the Brotherhood ceremony is one of the deeper and quieter mental impressions.\\"[11]\\r\\nThe Vigil Honor is a recognition given to Arrowmen for distinguished contributions beyond the immediate responsibilities of their position or office to their lodge, the Order of the Arrow, Scouting, or their Scout Camp.[32] The Vigil Honor may be conferred upon Arrowmen who have completed a minimum of two years as a Brotherhood member and have performed exceptional service above and beyond their immediate responsibilities through leadership, exemplary efforts, and dedication. However, under no circumstances should tenure in Scouting or the Order of the Arrow be considered as reason enough for a Vigil Honor recommendation.[32] Selection is annual and is limited to one person for every 50?members of the lodge,[32] and members of the Order can be inducted into the Vigil Honor only with the written approval of the National Order of the Arrow Committee.[32]\\r\\nAs a part of the Vigil Honor induction, each new Vigil Honor member is given a Vigil Honor name in the language of the Lenni Lenape or the language of their local Lodge. An English translation of the Vigil Honor name is also provided, and the name often represents a characteristic of the individual.[37]\\r\\nThe Order of the Arrow places great emphasis on being a youth-led organization. Only youth under the age 21 are voting members and are eligible to hold elected offices. Professional and volunteer adults are appointed to non-voting advisory positions at the chapter, lodge, and section levels.\\r\\nThe basic unit of the OA is the lodge, which is chartered by a local BSA council. The lodge chief is the elected youth leader, the lodge adviser is a BSA adult volunteer appointed by the Scout Executive, and the lodge staff adviser is the council Scout executive or his designated council professional Scouter. The lodge youth officers, consisting of the lodge chief, one or more vice chiefs, a secretary, and a treasurer are responsible for organizing and leading the various programs and activities of the lodge.[38] Many lodges have standing committees responsible for ceremonies, service projects, publications, unit elections, camp promotions, and dance teams composed of youth members. Lodges can also divide into chapters, usually corresponding to districts within the council. The chapter is led by the elected youth chapter chief, chapter vice chiefs, secretary, and a volunteer adult is appointed as the adviser, the district executive is the professional (staff) adviser.\\r\\nLodges are grouped into sections that are then grouped into regions. The section chief is the elected youth leader, a volunteer adult is appointed as the section adviser, and the area director (or his designate) is the professional (staff) adviser. In addition to the section chief, the section has two additional elected officers. The vice chief and secretary are elected immediately following the election of the section chief at the section's annual business meeting. All sections gather annually at a section conclave held in the late spring or early fall. The section officers lead the planning of this weekend with the help of the lodge chiefs in the section.[39]\\r\\nThe Order of the Arrow is organized into four regions, Central, Southern, Northeast and Western Region; the boundaries of each OA region correspond with the boundaries of the BSA's regions. Each region has an elected region chief, a volunteer adult who is appointed as the region chairman to oversee its region Committee, and an appointed professional (staff) adviser. Each region chief is elected at the national planning meeting the day after the election of the national chief and vice chief by a caucus of the section chiefs from the given region. The members of the region committee consist of the region chief, the region chairman, all national committeemen from the region, and other appointed adult volunteers. Each region annually has a gathering of all section officers and advisers. As a region, they are trained in topics relevant to their jobs. Each region also provides opportunities for Order of the Arrow members to go through a National Leadership Seminar. This weekend course is highly rated and a lasting memory for many members.[39]\\r\\nThe national chief and the national vice chief are selected by a caucus of the section chiefs at the outset of the Order of the Arrow's national planning meeting. At the national level, the OA is headed by the National Order of the Arrow committee of which the national chief and national vice chief are voting members.The national adult leadership includes the volunteer national chairman and the OA director, a professional Scouter.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nSashes: Ordeal, Brotherhood, Vigil Honor (from left to right)\\r\\n\\r\\nOrder of the Arrow pocket device\\r\\nArrowmen are identified by a white sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow. The Brotherhood member wears a sash bearing an arrow with a red bar at each end of the arrow. A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars of as the Brotherhood sash at each end of the arrow, and a Vigil Honor triangle on the center of the shaft. Members wear the sash at Order of the Arrow functions and special Scouting activities when members need to be identified as Arrowmen rendering special services. The OA sash is not worn at the same time as the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt.[40] The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.[41]\\r\\nThe OA Universal Ribbon is worn suspended from the right uniform shirt pocket button. Vigil Honor recipients may add the Vigil Honor pin to the ribbon. Lodge affiliation is indicated by the wearing of the lodge emblem (commonly known as a lodge flap), an embroidered patch is worn on the right pocket flap of the uniform shirt. Each lodge flap has a unique design, generally reflecting the name, geography or history of the lodge. Special issues of flaps may be created to commemorate anniversaries and other events and are a popular item for those who engage in Scouting memorabilia collecting.[42]\\r\\nArrowmen also exchange a special handshake as a token of brotherhood, along with other signs and passwords. A signature acronym, WWW, is often depicted in publications, regalia, etc.[43]\\r\\nThe Order of the Arrow utilizes three nationally standardized ceremonies for Ordeal, Brotherhood, and Vigil Honor memberships using themes, stories, and symbols centered on American Indian traditions as interpreted by the Order of the Arrow. It also utilizes symbolic progression, so that no symbols are introduced before the proper time. This is done to keep the sense of mystery surrounding the ceremonies and their various symbols. There is an element of mystery in the ceremonies for the sake of its effect on the participants, and so the three membership ceremonies are not performed in public. The ceremonies were standardized almost from the beginning of the OA to avoid misunderstandings regarding the diversity of religious beliefs among BSA members.\\r\\nCeremonies were once considered to be secret, and consequently, the OA has been viewed by some as a secret society. With the introduction of Youth Protection program guidelines in 1980s, the BSA has made clear that any concerned parent, guardian, or religious leader may view a video of the ceremonies, attend meetings, or read ceremonial texts upon request to a council, district, lodge, or chapter official to assure themselves that there is nothing objectionable.[44][45] Such persons are asked to safeguard the details relating to ceremonies for the sake of the participants. The intent of the provision for parents and religious leaders to be allowed access to ceremonies is to ensure that there is no religious conflict or violations of youth protection guidelines occurring. Parents have long been discouraged in many Lodges from seizing the opportunity to use the provision for photo opportunities with their sons, and some lodges have instituted bans on photography during the ceremonies. Hazing or demeaning initiation pranks are also prohibited by the OA and the BSA.[44][46]\\r\\nThe ceremonies utilize symbolic settings, rites, and principles to convey various Scouting ideals to participants.[47] As one author depicts a ceremony, \\"The values of the Order of the Arrow, 'a brotherhood of cheerful service,' were passed on during a night-time ceremony: an arrowhead outlined with stones on the ground, candles on the stones, a huge bonfire at the base of the arrowhead, and at the point of the arrow a lectern from which was read, and danced, the story of heroic sacrifice for others.\\"[48] Ceremonies also utilize the OA song, commonly referred to by its first line of lyrics as Firm Bound in Brotherhood, and titled Order of the Arrow Official Song and The Order of the Arrow Song in the printed music score of official OA publications.[40][49][50] It was written in 1921 by OA founder E. Urner Goodman to the Russian hymn tune God Save the Tsar!, composed by Alexei Lvov in the 19th century.[15][51]\\r\\nOA ceremony teams are also occasionally asked to assist local Cub Scout and Boy Scout units with special ceremonies including Arrow of Light ceremonies for the Cub Scouts and Eagle Scout ceremonies for Boy Scouts.\\r\\nAwards are separate and distinct from the membership levels of Ordeal and Brotherhood. Awards available through the Order of the Arrow include: Vigil Honor, Founder's Award, Distinguished Service Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Red Arrow Award, E. Urner Goodman Camping Award.[52]\\r\\nMost lodges hold several annual events, such as one or two annual lodge fellowships, an annual lodge recognition dinner, and one or more Ordeal weekends which usually include Brotherhood ceremonies as well. Many larger lodges delegate responsibility for Ordeal weekends and other service projects upon the individual chapters. Individual summer camps may also host \\"OA days\\" during which members of the OA may receive small tokens of recognition in exchange for showing their sash.\\r\\nThe section conclave is an annual activity (prior to 1972 known as an Area OA Conference) involving three or more lodges in an established geographic area. Each conclave is led by Section youth officers elected from among the member lodges at the previous year's conclave, and the event itself is prepared in cooperation with various other lodge officers, and with one lodge serving as the \\"host lodge\\".\\r\\nThe national OA committee also sponsors various national service opportunities, the oldest of which is the National OA Service Corps at the national Scout jamborees, at which Arrowmen have helped with many functions including shows and the Outdoor Adventure Program exhibit.[53]\\r\\nThe Order of the Arrow, in its focus on service and humility, sponsors service groups to the four National High Adventure Bases that focus on conservation. Inspired by three gentlemen, Edward Pease, Eugene \\"Gene\\" Schnell and Marty Tschetter who gathered at a leadership summit at Philmont Scout Ranch in 1979, the Order of the Arrow High Adventure program was established. Originally starting with the Order of the Arrow Trail Crew at the Philmont Scout Ranch working to build new trails and repair old ones. This expanded to the Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases with the OA Wilderness Voyage, repairing the portage trails in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, and then to Florida National High Adventure Sea Base in 2005 with Ocean Adventure, which works to remove invasive species on some of the Keys and promoting and carrying out of the Bleach watch program in the Florida Keys. After the addition of the third High Adventure Base, the Order of the Arrow implemented the OA Triple Crown Award In the summer of 2009, the OA began the OA Canadian Odyssey program which provided service similar to the OA Wilderness Voyage to the Quetico Provincial Park. In 2014, The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve began hosting the Order of the Arrow Summit Experience [54] which gives service to the New River Gorge National River.\\r\\nThe National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC) is a multi-day event which usually takes place on a university campus, bringing together thousands of delegates from OA lodges around the nation for training and activities. NOACs are held every two years, with exceptions made to align the event with significant anniversaries. As a youth-led organization, these national conferences are organized and directed by the elected section and region youth officers, who serve on committees responsible for various conference aspects under the leadership of the conference vice-chief. Events include training for programs, leadership and American Indian culture; competitions in athletics, ceremonies, cooking and American Indian dances; and exhibits on OA history, outdoor activities, and camping. There are also opportunities to talk with national leaders, perform service work and trade patches. Evening shows have different themes, including American Indian culture and recognition of dance competition winners, presentations of awards including the OA Distinguished Service Award and other entertainment.[53]\\r\\nIn addition to training courses available at a NOAC or section conclave, the OA offers specialized leadership training as weekend events for members: Lodge Leadership Development (LLD), National Leadership Seminars (NLS), and National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS). LLD is a one-day or two-day event conducted by a lodge to train their officers and advisers. NLS's are conducted by regions for lodge officers and advisers. Many lodges send key officers to receive training. Typically, each region schedules three or four NLS weekends annually, at geographically dispersed locations within the region. NLATS is a training event for adults, usually held in conjunction with an NLS and conducted by regions, on the role of advisers in the OA.[55]\\r\\nThe LLDs primary objective is to train and orient lodge and chapter officers to the logistics of operating their chapters and lodges. Lodges are primarily responsible for providing this training to its officers, and there are resources available online to add to the courses syllabus.\\r\\nEach region in the Order of the Arrow is responsible for putting on three to four NLSs each year in different areas of the region. The NLS has received praise for being one of the most valuable trainings offered by the BSA. Participants spend a weekend with Arrowmen in different parts of the region learning about the theory and practice of effective leadership. Each region is responsible for their NLSs program, and the weekend is organized by the region chief and his support staff. Primary NLS staff go through a national training weekend called Train the Trainer, put on once every two years.\\r\\nLargely considered the adult equivalent of the NLS program, NLATSs primary objective was to provide advanced training to adults in each lodge. NLATS and NLS usually happened concurrently on the same weekend. The events were planned and executed by a staff of adults.\\r\\nAfter successful pilots in 2016, the new \\"Developing Youth Leadership Conference\\" curriculum began replacing NLATS in early 2017.[56]\\r\\nAccording to historian Philip J. Deloria, the founders of the Order of the Arrow decided to present Native American characteristics \\"as a sign of scouting excellence.\\" Goodman and Edson established the OA at Treasure Island Scout Reservation as a Scouting honor society with elements derived from their interpretation of the poem Hiawatha and the novel The Last of the Mohicans. Inductions of new OA members at Treasure Island involved OA ceremonialists wearing Native American regalia at camp bonfires.[57]\\r\\nIn the past, some ceremonialists used face paint, performed dances with religious significance, and used objectionable terms regarding Native Americans. The OA no longer allows these practices, stating that this is in recognition of preferences of Native American groups that found such actions offensive. Exceptions are made for those OA members who are actually enrolled tribal members, such as the members of the various Florida lodges, such as Seminole 85 and Osceola 564, both of which contain numerous members of those respective tribal groups.[58]\\r\\nModern ceremonies conducted by each OA lodge are influenced by the history and traditions of the Native American tribes indigenous to the areas the lodge serves. Multiple Native Americans have attended OA events and worked with their local OA lodge to help Arrowmen learn the context of their history and traditions.[59] A 2003 Ceremonial Team Training guide of the Shawnee Lodge of the OA advised Arrowmen that among the factors to be considered pertaining to regalia used in ceremonies, \\"The first and foremost is respect for Native Americans, especially those whose tribal style you are emulating.\\"[60]\\r\\nAccording to the Indian Affairs team of the Atta Kulla Kulla Lodge:\\r\\nSome individual Native Americans may still find fault with people who are not Native Americans performing ceremonies and dances. It is not possible to please everyone no matter what you do, so members of the Order should note that their practices are discussed at length with representatives of other tribes and found acceptable. This approval puts such critics in the odd position of attempting to dictate practices to other Native American groups.[58]\\r\\nThe OA has been criticized for cultural appropriation with regard to conducting simulated Native American ceremonies, with critics viewing these ceremonies as marginalizing Native Americans and reinforcing stereotypes about them.[61][62]\\r\\nSome OA lodges have been criticized for incorporating into their ceremonies elements from Native American groups of other parts of the U.S., blending together the traditions without apparent recognition or regard to distinctions among Native American groups. Use of objects considered sacred to some Native American groups in ways other than they intended has been observed, as emphasized by Ozheebeegay Ikwe, a Native American activist:\\r\\nI have been told that if we are not using these sacred objects as they are intended, we arent walking the walk. Along with carrying and using these items, comes a great deal of responsibility. Not just anyone should have them. I want my children to know the truth that is the Drum, Pipe, and Eagle Feather. I want them to understand that traditional ways are not a costume or boy scout initiation. They are alive, they are sacred.[63]\\r\\nThe OA as well has been criticized by some Native American groups for using Native American imagery at its national conferences without a sufficient portion of the membership consisting of Native Americans.[64]","input":"What is order of the arrow boy scouts?"},{"output":"over 300,000,000","context":"The following is a list with the Billboard Music Award winners for Top Social Artist.

As with other developed nations, the country's economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three quarters of Canadians.[21] Canada has the fourth highest total estimated value of natural resources, valued at US$33.2 trillion in 2016.[22] It has the world's third largest proven petroleum reserves and is the fourth largest exporter of petroleum. It is also the fourth largest exporter of natural gas. Canada is considered an \\"energy superpower\\" due to its abundant natural resources and small population.[23][24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of the primary sector, with the logging and oil industries being two of Canada's most important. Canada also has a sizable manufacturing sector, based in Central Canada, with the automobile industry and aircraft industry being especially important. With the world's longest coastline, Canada has the 8th largest commercial fishing and seafood industry in the world.[27][28] Canada is one of the global leaders of the entertainment software industry.[29] It is a member of the APEC, NAFTA, G7, G20, OECD and WTO.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of a few island nations in the Caribbean, Canada is the only major Parliamentary system in the Western Hemisphere. As a result, Canada has developed its own social and political institutions, distinct from most other countries in the world.[30] Though the Canadian economy is closely integrated with the American economy, it has developed unique economic institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian economic system generally combines elements of private enterprise and public enterprise. Many aspects of public enterprise, most notably the development of an extensive social welfare system to redress social and economic inequities, were adopted after the end of World War Two in 1945.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada has a private to public (Crown) property ratio of 60:40 and one of the highest levels of economic freedom in the world. Today Canada closely resembles the U.S. in its market-oriented economic system and pattern of production.[31] As of 2017, Canada has 58 companies in the Forbes Global 2000 list, ranking seventh behind France and ahead of India.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational trade makes up a large part of the Canadian economy, particularly of its natural resources. In 2009, agriculture, energy, forestry and mining exports accounted for about 58% of Canada's total exports.[33] Machinery, equipment, automotive products and other manufactures accounted for a further 38% of exports in 2009.[33] In 2009, exports accounted for about 30% of Canada's GDP. The United States is by far its largest trading partner, accounting for about 73% of exports and 63% of imports as of 2009.[34] Canada's combined exports and imports ranked 8th among all nations in 2006.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 4% of Canadians are directly employed in primary resource fields, and they account for 6.2% of GDP.[36] They are still paramount in many parts of the country. Many, if not most, towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, exist because of a nearby mine or source of timber. Canada is a world leader in the production of many natural resources such as gold, nickel, uranium, diamonds, lead, and in recent years, crude petroleum, which, with the world's second-largest oil reserves, is taking an increasingly prominent position in natural resources extraction. Several of Canada's largest companies are based in natural resource industries, such as Encana, Cameco, Goldcorp, and Barrick Gold. The vast majority of these products are exported, mainly to the United States. There are also many secondary and service industries that are directly linked to primary ones. For instance one of Canada's largest manufacturing industries is the pulp and paper sector, which is directly linked to the logging business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reliance on natural resources has several effects on the Canadian economy and Canadian society. While manufacturing and service industries are easy to standardize, natural resources vary greatly by region. This ensures that differing economic structures developed in each region of Canada, contributing to Canada's strong regionalism. At the same time the vast majority of these resources are exported, integrating Canada closely into the international economy. Howlett and Ramesh argue that the inherent instability of such industries also contributes to greater government intervention in the economy, to reduce the social impact of market changes.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural resource industries also raise important questions of sustainability. Despite many decades as a leading producer, there is little risk of depletion. Large discoveries continue to be made, such as the massive nickel find at Voisey's Bay. Moreover, the far north remains largely undeveloped as producers await higher prices or new technologies as many operations in this region are not yet cost effective. In recent decades Canadians have become less willing to accept the environmental destruction associated with exploiting natural resources. High wages and Aboriginal land claims have also curbed expansion. Instead many Canadian companies have focused their exploration, exploitation and expansion activities overseas where prices are lower and governments more amenable. Canadian companies are increasingly playing important roles in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depletion of renewable resources has raised concerns in recent years. After decades of escalating overutilization the cod fishery all but collapsed in the 1990s, and the Pacific salmon industry also suffered greatly. The logging industry, after many years of activism, has in recent years moved to a more sustainable model, or to other countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nProductivity measures are key indicators of economic performance and a key source of economic growth and competitiveness. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s[notes 1] Compendium of Productivity Indicators,[39] published annually, presents a broad overview of productivity levels and growth in member nations, highlighting key measurement issues. It analyses the role of \\"productivity as the main driver of economic growth and convergence\\" and the \\"contributions of labour, capital and MFP in driving economic growth\\".[39] According to the definition above \\"MFP is often interpreted as the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation\\" (OECD 2008,11). Measures of productivity include Gross Domestic Product (GDP)(OECD 2008,11) and multifactor productivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OECD provides data for example comparing labour productivity levels in the total economy of each member nation. In their 2012 report Canada's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was $CDN 1,773,763,000,000.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) quarterly World Economic Outlook released in April 2015, the IMF forecast that Canada's real gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 2.2 percent. In the July World Economic Outlook the IMF forecast that Canada's real GDP would grow by 1.5 per cent in 2015.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to CTV News real estate accounts for half of all GDP growth.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother productivity measure, used by the OECD, is the long-term trend in multifactor productivity (MFP) also known as total factor productivity (TFP). This indicator assesses an economy's \\"underlying productive capacity ('potential output'), itself an important measure of the growth possibilities of economies and of inflationary pressures\\". MFP measures the residual growth that cannot be explained by the rate of change in the services of labour, capital and intermediate outputs, and is often interpreted as the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation. (OECD 2008,11)\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the OECD's annual economic survey of Canada in June 2012, Canada has experienced weak growth of multi-factor productivity (MFP) and has been declining further since 2002. One of the ways MFP growth is raised is by boosting innovation and Canada's innovation indicators such as business R&D and patenting rates were poor. Raising MFP growth is \\"needed to sustain rising living standards, especially as the population ages\\".[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank of Canada, a federal crown corporation, has the responsibility of Canada's monetary system. During the period that John Crow was Governor of the Bank of Canada1987 to 1994 there was a worldwide recession and the bank rate rose to around 14% and unemployment topped 11%.[44] In 1991, with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in office, the federal government and the Bank of Canada announced a new inflation-targeting monetary policy that has been the cornerstone of Canada's monetary and fiscal policy ever since.[45][46] Although since that time inflation-targeting has been adopted by \\"most advanced-world central banks\\",[47] in 1991 it was innovative and Canada was an early adopter when the then-Finance Minister Michael Wilson approved the Bank of Canada's first inflation-targeting in the 1991 federal budget.[47] The inflation target was set at 2 per cent, which is the midpoint of an inflation range of 1 to 3 per cent. They established a set of inflation-reduction targets to keep inflation \\"low, stable and predictable\\" and to foster \\"confidence in the value of money\\", contribute to Canada's sustained growth, employment gains and improved standard of living.[45] Inflation is measured by the total consumer price index (CPI). In 2011 the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada extended Canada's inflation-control target to December 31, 2016.[45] The Bank of Canada uses three unconventional instruments to achieve the inflation target: \\"a conditional statement on the future path of the policy rate\\", quantitative easing, and credit easing.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, interest rates and inflation eventually came down along with the value of the Canadian dollar.[44] From 1991 to 2011 the inflation-targeting regime kept \\"price gains fairly reliable\\".[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the Financial crisis of 2007ÿ08 the narrow focus of inflation-targeting as a means of providing stable growth in the Canadian economy was questioned. By 2011, the then-Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney argued that the central bank's mandate would allow for a more flexible inflation-targeting in specific situations where he would consider taking longer \\"than the typical six to eight quarters to return inflation to 2 per cent\\".[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central bankthe Bank of Canadaissues its rate announcement through its Monetary Policy Report which is released eight times a year.[45] On July 15, 2015, the Bank of Canada announced that it was lowering its target for the overnight rate by another one-quarter percentage point, to 0.5 per cent[49] \\"to try to stimulate an economy that appears to have failed to rebound meaningfully from the oil shock woes that dragged it into decline in the first quarter\\".[41] According to the Bank of Canada announcement, in the first quarter of 2015, the total Consumer price index (CPI) inflation was about 1 per cent. This reflects \\"year-over-year price declines for consumer energy products\\". Core inflation in the first quarter of 2015 was about 2 per cent with an underlying trend in inflation at about 1.5 to 1.7 per cent.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the Bank of Canada's July 15, 2015 rate adjustment, Prime Minister Stephen Harper explained that the economy was \\"being dragged down by forces beyond Canadian borders such as  global oil prices, the European debt crisis, and China's economic slowdown\\" which has made the global economy \\"fragile\\".[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese stock market had lost about US$3 trillion of wealth by July 2015 when panicked investors sold stocks, which created declines in the commodities markets, which in turn negatively impacted resource-producing countries like Canada.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank's main priority has been to keep inflation at a moderate level.[52] As part of that strategy, interest rates were kept at a low level for almost seven years. Since September 2010, the key interest rate (overnight rate) was 0.5%. In mid 2017, inflation remained below the Bank's 2% target, (at 1.6%)[53] mostly because of reductions in the cost of energy, food and automobiles; as well, the economy was in a continuing spurt with a predicted GDP growth of 2.8 percent by year end.[54][55] Early on 12 July 2017, the bank issued a statement that the benchmark rate would be increased to 0.75%. \\"The economy can handle very well this move we have today and of course you need to preface that with an acknowledgment that of course interest rates are still very low\\", Governor Stephen Poloz subsequently said. In its press release, the bank had confirmed that the rate would continue to be evaluated at least partly on the basis of inflation. \\"Future adjustments to the target for the overnight rate will be guided by incoming data as they inform the bank's inflation outlook, keeping in mind continued uncertainty and financial system vulnerabilities.\\"[56][57] Poloz refused to speculate on the future of the economy but said, \\"I don't doubt that interest rates will move higher, but there's no predetermined path in mind at this stage\\".[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, the Canadian economy had the following relative weighting by industry, as percentage value of GDP:[36][59]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe service sector in Canada is vast and multifaceted, employing about three quarters of Canadians and accounting for 70% of GDP.[60] The largest employer is the retail sector, employing almost 12% of Canadians.[61] The retail industry is concentrated mainly in a small number of chain stores clustered together in shopping malls. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of big-box stores, such as Wal-Mart (of the United States), Real Canadian Superstore, and Best Buy (of the United States). This has led to fewer workers in this sector and a migration of retail jobs to the suburbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second largest portion of the service sector is the business service and hire only a slightly smaller percentage of the population.[62] This includes the financial services, real estate, and communications industries. This portion of the economy has been rapidly growing in recent years. It is largely concentrated in the major urban centres, especially Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver (see Banking in Canada).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe education and health sectors are two of Canada's largest, but both are largely under the influence of the government. The health care industry has been quickly growing, and is the third largest in Canada. Its rapid growth has led to problems for governments who must find money to fund it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada has an important high tech industry, and a burgeoning film, television, and entertainment industry creating content for local and international consumption (see Media in Canada).[63] Tourism is of ever increasing importance, with the vast majority of international visitors coming from the United States. Casino gaming is currently the fastest-growing component of the Canadian tourism industry, contributing $5 billion in profits for Canadian governments and employing 41,000 Canadians as of 2001.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general pattern of development for wealthy nations was a transition from a primary industry based economy to a manufacturing based one, and then to a service based economy. Canada did not escape this pattern ÿ at its (abnormally high World War II) peak in 1944, manufacturing accounted for 29% of GDP,[65] declining to 15.6% in 2005. Canada has not suffered as greatly as most other rich, industrialized nations from the pains of the relative decline in the importance of manufacturing since the 1960s.[66] A 2009 study by Statistics Canada also found that, while manufacturing declined as a relative percentage of GDP from 24.3% in the 1960s to 15.6% in 2005, manufacturing volumes between 1961 and 2005 kept pace with the overall growth in the volume index of GDP.[67] Manufacturing in Canada was especially hit hard by the financial crisis of 2007ÿ08. As of 2010, manufacturing accounts for 13% of Canada's GDP,[36] a relative decline of more than 2% of GDP since 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nCentral Canada is home to branch plants to all the major American and Japanese automobile makers and many parts factories owned by Canadian firms such as Magna International and Linamar Corporation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada is one of the few developed nations that is a net exporter of energyin 2009 net exports of energy products amounted to 2.9% of GDP. Most important are the large oil and gas resources centred in Alberta and the Northern Territories, but also present in neighbouring British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The vast Athabasca oil sands give Canada the world's third largest reserves of oil after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela according to USGS. In British Columbia and Quebec, as well as Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the Labrador region, hydroelectric power is an inexpensive and relatively environmentally friendly source of abundant energy. In part because of this, Canada is also one of the world's highest per capita consumers of energy.[68][69] Cheap energy has enabled the creation of several important industries, such as the large aluminum industries in British Columbia[70] and Quebec.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, an important issue in Canadian politics is the interplay between the oil and energy industry in Western Canada and the industrial heartland of Southern Ontario. Foreign investment in Western oil projects has fueled Canada's rising dollar. This has raised the price of Ontario's manufacturing exports and made them less competitive, a problem similar to the decline of the manufacturing sector in the Netherlands.[72][73] Also, Ontario has relatively fewer native sources of power. However, it is cheaper for Alberta to ship its oil to the western United States than to eastern Canada. The eastern Canadian ports thus import significant quantities of oil from overseas, and Ontario makes significant use of nuclear power.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Energy Policy of the early 1980s attempted to force Alberta to sell low-priced oil to eastern Canada. This policy proved deeply divisive, and quickly lost its importance as oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980s. One of the most controversial sections of the CanadaÿUnited States Free Trade Agreement of 1988 was a promise that Canada would never charge the United States more for energy than fellow Canadians.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada is also one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products, particularly of wheat and other grains.[75] Canada is a major exporter of agricultural products, to the United States and Asia. As with all other developed nations the proportion of the population and GDP devoted to agriculture fell dramatically over the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with other developed nations, the Canadian agriculture industry receives significant government subsidies and supports. However, Canada has been a strong supporter of reducing market influencing subsidies through the World Trade Organization. In 2000, Canada spent approximately CDN$4.6 billion on supports for the industry. Of this, $2.32 billion was classified under the WTO designation of \\"green box\\" support, meaning it did not directly influence the market, such as money for research or disaster relief. All but $848.2 million were subsidies worth less than 5% of the value of the crops they were provided for.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada is negotiating bilateral FTAs with the following countries and trade blocs:\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada has been involved in negotiations to create the following regional trade blocks:\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada and the United States share a common trading relationship. Canada's job market continues to perform well along with the US, reaching a 30-year low in the unemployment rate in December 2006, following 14 consecutive years of employment growth.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States is by far Canada's largest trading partner, with more than $1.7 billion CAD in trade per day in 2005.[80] In 2009, 73% of Canada's exports went to the United States, and 63% of Canada's imports were from the United States.[81] Trade with Canada makes up 23% of the United States' exports and 17% of its imports.[82]  By comparison, in 2005 this was more than U.S. trade with all countries in the European Union combined,[83] and well over twice U.S. trade with all the countries of Latin America combined.[84]  Just the two-way trade that crosses the Ambassador Bridge between Michigan and Ontario equals all U.S. exports to Japan. Canada's importance to the United States is not just a border-state phenomenon: Canada is the leading export market for 35 of 50 U.S. states, and is the United States' largest foreign supplier of energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBilateral trade increased by 52% between 1989, when the U.S.ÿCanada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) went into effect, and 1994, when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) superseded it.[citation needed] Trade has since increased by 40%. NAFTA continues the FTA's moves toward reducing trade barriers and establishing agreed-upon trade rules. It also resolves some long-standing bilateral irritants and liberalizes rules in several areas, including agriculture, services, energy, financial services, investment, and government procurement. NAFTA forms the largest trading area in the world, embracing the 405 million people of the three North American countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest component of U.S.ÿCanada trade is in the commodity sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. is Canada's largest agricultural export market, taking well over half of all Canadian food exports.[85] Nearly two-thirds of Canada's forest products, including pulp and paper, are exported to the United States; 72% of Canada's total newsprint production also is exported to the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt $73.6 billion in 2004, U.S.-Canada trade in energy is the largest U.S. energy trading relationship, with the overwhelming majority ($66.7 billion) being exports from Canada. The primary components of U.S. energy trade with Canada are petroleum, natural gas, and electricity. Canada is the United States' largest oil supplier and the fifth-largest energy producing country in the world. Canada provides about 16% of U.S. oil imports and 14% of total U.S. consumption of natural gas. The United States and Canada's national electricity grids are linked, and both countries share hydropower facilities on the western borders.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile most of U.S.-Canada trade flows smoothly, there are occasionally bilateral trade disputes, particularly in the agricultural and cultural fields.[citation needed] Usually these issues are resolved through bilateral consultative forums or referral to World Trade Organization (WTO) or NAFTA dispute resolution.[citation needed] In May 1999, the U.S. and Canadian governments negotiated an agreement on magazines that provides increased access for the U.S. publishing industry to the Canadian market. The United States and Canada also have resolved several major issues involving fisheries. By common agreement, the two countries submitted a Gulf of Maine boundary dispute to the International Court of Justice in 1981; both accepted the court's 12 October 1984 ruling which demarcated the territorial sea boundary. A current issue between the United States and Canada is the ongoing softwood lumber dispute, as the U.S. alleges that Canada unfairly subsidizes its forestry industry.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, the United States and Canada signed a bilateral Fisheries Enforcement Agreement, which has served to deter illegal fishing activity and reduce the risk of injury during fisheries enforcement incidents. The U.S. and Canada signed a Pacific Salmon Agreement in June 1999 that settled differences over implementation of the 1985 Pacific Salmon Treaty for the next decade.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada and the United States signed an aviation agreement during Bill Clinton's visit to Canada in February 1995, and air traffic between the two countries has increased dramatically as a result. The two countries also share in operation of the St. Lawrence Seaway, connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. is Canada's largest foreign investor and the most popular destination for Canadian foreign investments; at the end of 2007, the stock of U.S. direct investment in Canada was estimated at $293 billion, while Canadian direct investment (stock) in the United States was valued at $213 billion.[88][89] U.S. FDI accounts for 59.5% of total foreign direct investment in Canada while Canadian FDI in the U.S. accounts for 10% (5th largest foreign investor).[90] US investments are primarily directed at Canada's mining and smelting industries, petroleum, chemicals, the manufacture of machinery and transportation equipment, and finance, while Canadian investment in the United States is concentrated in manufacturing, wholesale trade, real estate, petroleum, finance, and insurance and other services.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OECD reports the Central Government Debt as percentage of the GDP. In 2000 Canada's was 40.9 percent, in 2007 it was 25.2 percent, in 2008 it was 28.6 percent and by 2010 it was 36.1 percent.[92] The OECD reports net financial liabilities measure used by the OECD, reports the net number at 25.2%, as of 2008,[92] making Canada's total government debt burden as the lowest in the G8. The gross number was 68% in 2011.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CIA World Factbook, updated weekly, measures financial liabilities by using gross general government debt, as opposed to net federal debt used by the OECD and the Canadian federal government. Gross general government debt includes both \\"intragovernmental debt and the debt of public entities at the sub-national level\\". For example, the CIA measured Canada's public debt as 84.1% of GDP in 2012 and 87.4% of GDP in 2011 making it 22nd in the world.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2015 the International Monetary Fund reported that Canada's high household debt was one of two vulnerable domestic areas in Canada's economy; the second is its overheated housing market.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a July 2015 report by Laura Cooper, an economist with the RBCthe largest financial institution in Canada\\"outstanding household credit balances\\" had reached $1.83 trillion.[96] Canadian household credit growth had reached a peak in 2009 then plummeted to a cycle-low in late 2013.[96] There was a quickened pace of growth in household debt in December 2012 and another in April and May 2015.[96][97]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the August 2013 third annual Ipsos Reid Debt Poll only 24 per cent of Canadians were debt free in 2013 compared to 26 per cent in 2012. The average personal non-mortgage debt in 2013 was $15,920 up from $13,141 in 2012. According to an IPSOS chart produced in 2013 debt levels increased \\"a staggering 35 per cent\\" in Western Canada compared to 10 per cent in Eastern Canada since 2012 even before the Alberta floods.[98] In Alberta in 2013 household debt rose 63 per cent to $24,271 per household from 2012 after the 2013 Alberta floods.[99] In 2013 the average personal debt load in British Columbia was \\"up 38 per cent to $15,549\\"; in \\"Manitoba and Saskatchewan, up 32 per cent to $16,145\\"; in Ontario, \\"up 13 per cent to $17,416\\", in Quebec up \\"3 per cent to $10,458\\"; and in Atlantic Canada, \\"up 12 per cent to $15,243\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nStatistics Canada announced in December 2014 that Canada's household debt-to-income ratio \\"hit a record high in the third quarter of 2014, climbing to 162.6 percent from 161.5 percent in the second quarter\\".

Paul Krugman argued that by 2007 household debt in the United States, prior to the financial crisis, had reached 130 percent of household income. Krugman distinguished between the total domestic non-financial debt (public plus private) relative to GDP which is \\"money we owe to ourselves\\" and net foreign debt.[104][105] Statistics Canada reported in March 2013 that \\"credit-market debt such as mortgages rose to 165% of disposable income, compared with 164.7% in the prior three-month period\\" in 2013[106] According to the IMF in 2012, \\"Housing-related debt (mortgages) comprises about 70 percent of gross household debt in advanced economies.

In 1994, various organizations, including the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences, adopted the new term \\"family and consumer science\\" to reflect the fact that the field covers aspects outside of home life and wellness.[2]\\r\\nThe field is also known by other names, including human sciences, home science, and domestic economy. In addition, home economics has a strong historic relationship to the field of human ecology, and since the 1960s a number of university-level home economics programs have been renamed \\"human ecology\\" programs, including Cornell University's program.[3]\\r\\nOne of the first to champion the economics of running a home was Catherine Beecher, sister to Harriet Beecher Stowe. Catherine and Harriet both were leaders in mid-19th century North America in talking about domestic science. They came from a very religious family that valued education especially for women.\\r\\nThe Morrill Act of 1862 propelled domestic science further ahead as land grant colleges sought to educate farm wives in running their households as their husbands were being educated in agricultural methods and processes. Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan were early leaders offering programs for women. There were women graduates of these institutions several years before the Lake Placid Conferences which gave birth to the home economics movement.\\r\\nThe home economics movement started with Ellen Swallow Richards, who was the first woman to attend Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later became the first female instructor. Through her chemistry research, she became an expert in water quality and later began to focus on applying scientific principles to domestic situations. At the Chicago Worlds Fair in 1893, she designed the Rumford Kitchen, which was a tiny kitchen that served nutritious meals to thousands of fair goers, along with a healthy dose of nutrition education. She shunned an invitation to participate in the Womens Building as she said none of her research was just womens work, but rather information for all.\\r\\nLate in the 19th century, Richards convened a group of contemporaries to discuss the essence of domestic science and how the elements of this discipline would ultimately improve the quality of life for many individuals and families. They met at pristine Lake Placid, New York at the invitation of Melvil Dewey. Over the course of the next 10 years, these educators worked tirelessly to elevate the discipline, which was to become home economics, to a legitimate profession. Richards wanted to call this oekology or the science of right living. Euthenics, the science of controllable environment, was also a name of her choice, but \\"home economics\\" was ultimately chosen as the official term in 1899.[4] Richards then founded the American Home Economics Association (now called the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences) in 1909.[4]\\r\\nIn the 1910s the AHEA won passage of two crucial pieces of legislation that allowed home economists to establish formal niches for research and teaching within institutions of higher education. The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 and the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 provided funding to expand demonstration work in rural communities and to develop and teach a home economics curriculum on the campuses of most state land-grant colleges.[5] This legislation contributed to the creation of the Office of Home Economics, which grew into the Bureau of Home Economics, at the US Department of Agriculture during the early 20th century.\\r\\nHome economics emerged at the turn of the twentieth century as a movement to train women to be more efficient household managers. At the same moment, American families began to consume many more goods and services than they produced. To guide women in this transition, professional home economics had two major goals: to teach women to assume their new roles as modern consumers and to communicate homemakers needs to manufacturers and political leaders. The development of the profession progressed from its origins as an educational movement to its identity as a source of consumer expertise in the interwar period to its virtual disappearance by the 1970s.[6] An additional goal of the field was to rationalize housework, or lend the social status of a profession to it, based on a theory that housework could be intellectually fulfilling to women engaged in it, along with any emotional or relational benefits.[7]\\r\\nIn the 19th century, home economics classes were intended to ready young women for their duties in the home in healthy environments. Classes were first offered in the United States, Canada, Germany and Great Britain, followed by Latin America, Asia, and Africa. International organizations such as those associated with the United Nations have been involved in starting home economics programs around the world.[8]\\r\\nThrough the 1940s Iowa State College (later University) was the only program granting a master of science in household equipment. However, this program was centered on the ideals that women should acquire practical skills but also a scientifically based understanding of how technology in the household works. For example, women were required to disassemble and then reassemble kitchen machinery so they could understand basic operations as well as repair the equipment. In doing so, Iowa State effectively created culturally acceptable forms of physics and engineering for women in an era when these pursuits were not generally accessible to them.[9]\\r\\nHome economists  found a receptive audience among many of its young female members who expressed interest in learning about how to improve their homes, spend their leisure time, and make decisions about what to buy, what to make at home, and even what books to read.[10] Though mens participation in Home Economics programs was encouraged it was not actively recruited, and in future courses at universities such as Cornell, mens roles became entrenched in such courses as hotel management in the hospitality industry.[7]\\r\\nA Standards Committees proposal in 1924 changed the AHEA constitution allowing for a special voting membership section clearing the way for HEIB (Home Economists in Business) section.[11] The largest group of HEIB members worked for food companies such as Washburn Crosby (later General Mills), Kelloggs, ..or trade associations charged with promoting particular foods such as the Institute of American Meat Packers and the National Dairy Council. [Some] worked as journalists for womens magazines such as.. the Ladies Home Journal. [Others] worked for utility companies.[12]\\r\\nThe function that home economists have been performing for more than a century remains key to our experiences as consumers, but the professional identity has disappeared. Indeed, efforts to reposition the discipline ultimately led to its renaming in the late twentieth century. In 1994, home economics was replaced by family and consumer science.죣This renaming signaled a formal break from the fields association with domesticity, highlighting instead issues of family and consumption.[13]\\r\\nA new actor that rose to prominence in the 1980s was the charismatic celebrity unaligned with home economists or any other professional group. Martha Stewart and her fellow domestic celebrities, in television programs, books, magazines, and websites, attest to the continued importance of independent experts and commercial mass-media organizations in facilitating technological and cultural change in consumer products and services industries.[14]\\r\\nTo a great degree, Americans today tap into values once enshrined in a home economics curriculum to express a national identity and assert a standard of living that is distinct not only from Third World cultures but also from the cultures of other industrialized nations.... Even as luxury consumption exerts a cultural pull for many, middle-class culture still celebrates consumers who make sensible, controlled choices in the marketplace, resisting pure pleasure, impulse purchases, and cheap or shoddy goods.[15]\\r\\nPractice homes were added to American universities in the early 1900s in order to model a living situation, although the all-women team model used for students was different from prevailing expectations of housewives. For example, women were graded on collaboration, while households at the time assumed that women would be working independently.[7]\\r\\nNevertheless, the practice homes were valued. These practicum courses took place in a variety of environments including single-family homes, apartments, and student dorm-style blocks. For a duration of a number of weeks, students lived together while taking on different roles and responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, interior decoration, hosting, and budgeting. Some classes also involved caring for young infants, temporarily adopted from orphanages. Childcare practicums were often included at the same time as other classwork, requiring students to configure their intellectual and home lives as compatible with one another. According to Megan Elias, in the ideal, domestic work was as important as work done outside the home and it was performed by teams of equals who rotated roles. Each member of the team was able to live a life outside the home as well as inside the home, ideally, one that both informed her domestic work and was informed by it. This balance between home and the wider world was basic to the movement.[7]\\r\\nFCS is taught worldwide, both as an elective or as a required course in secondary education, and in many tertiary and continuing education institutions. Sometimes it is also taught in primary education. International cooperation in the field is coordinated by the International Federation for Home Economics, established in 1908.[16]\\r\\nBetween 1880 and 1900, the Reifenstein schools concept was initiated by Ida von Kortzfleisch, a Prussian noble woman and early German feminist. Reifenstein refers to Reifenstein im Eichsfeld, a municipality in Thuringia and site of the first permanent school. Reifensteiner Verband comprised from 1897 till 1990 about 15 own schools and cooperated with further operators. About 40 wirtschaftliche Frauenschulen, rural economist women schools were connected to the Reifensteiner concept and movement and allowed higher education for women already in the German Kaiserreich.[17] The 1913 doctorate of Johannes Kramer compared different concepts of home economic education worldwide and praised the system e.g. in Iowa.[18]\\r\\nIn South Korea, the field is most commonly known as \\"family studies\\" or \\"family science\\" (????, gajeong-gwahak). The field began in schools taught by Western missionaries in the late 19th century. The first college-level department of family science was established at Ewha Womans University in Seoul in 1929.[19]\\r\\nIn the United States, approximately 5 million students in US secondary education take FCS each year.[2]\\r\\nMany Education boards in India such as NIOS,[20] CBSE, ICSE,[21] CISCE[22] and various state boards offer home science as a subject in their courses.\\r\\nSituated in the human sciences, home economics draws from a range of disciplines to achieve optimal and sustainable living for individuals, families, and communities. Historically, home economics has been in the context of the home and household, but this has extended in the 21st century to include the wider living environments as we better understand that the capacities, choices, and priorities of individuals and families impact at all levels, ranging from the household to the local and the global community. Home economists are concerned with promoting and protecting the well-being of individuals, families, and communities; they facilitate the development of attributes for lifelong learning for paid, unpaid, and voluntary work. Home economics professionals are advocates for individuals, families, and communities.\\r\\nThe content of home economics comes from the synthesis of multiple disciplines. This interdisciplinary knowledge is essential because the phenomena and challenges of everyday life are not typically one-dimensional. The content of home economics courses vary, but may include: food, nutrition, and health; personal finance; family resource management and planning; textiles and clothing; shelter and housing; consumerism and consumer science; household management; design and technology; food science and hospitality; human development and family studies; communication and extension education and community services, among others. The capacity to draw from such disciplinary diversity is a strength of the profession, allowing for the development of specific interpretations of the field, as relevant to the context.\\r\\nHome cleaning tasks can be separated into four categories: litter removal, storage of belongings, dusting, and washing of surfaces. Washing of surfaces is the most dangerous and complicated part because of the cleaning solutions. For example, hard water deposits are cleaned with acid solutions and grease is cleaned with alkaline solutions; they can both harm the skin and are reactive toward each other, potentially producing unwanted by-products. Mixing together chlorine bleach and strong acids (e.g. limescale remover containing HCl) forms chlorine gas, which is toxic. Solvents such as paint thinner and rubbing alcohol are toxic and flammable. Some disinfectants are toxic. Even dish water can require rubber gloves.[23]\\r\\nDealing with finances is a key element of home economics. Understanding concepts such as debt, credit, loaning, interest rates and so on are important to having a healthy economic home. Life skills such as making a budget, keeping financial records and making frugal purchasing choices are all part of this subject area. As home economics is a very holistic field, one must also incorporate concepts like purchasing power and how consumers can affect the global world.\\r\\nThe AAFCS (American Association of Family & Consumer Sciences) represents teachers, educators, cooperatives, business, designers and nutritionists.The American Association of Family & Consumer Sciences (AAFCS) is the only national forum where K-12 teachers, university educators, and corporate executives collaborate to improve the quality of individual and family life.\\r\\nThe Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE) is the largest American national education association dedicated to the advancement of education that prepared youth and adults for successful careers.

This law gives the President of the United States the authority to, by presidential proclamation, create national monuments from  federal lands to protect significant natural, cultural, or scientific features. The Act has been used more than a hundred times since its passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Antiquities Act was signed into place by President Theodore Roosevelt during his second term in office. The act resulted from concerns about protecting mostly prehistoric Native American ruins and artifacts?ÿ collectively termed \\"antiquities\\"?ÿ on federal lands in the West, such as at Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.  Removal of artifacts from these lands by private collectors, \\"pot hunters,\\" had become a serious problem by the end of the 19th century.  In 1902, Iowa Congressman John F. Lacey, who chaired the House Committee on the Public Lands, traveled to the Southwest with the rising anthropologist Edgar Lee Hewett, to see for himself the extent of the pot hunters' impact.  His findings, supported by an exhaustive report by Hewett to Congress detailing the archaeological resources of the region, provided the necessary impetus for the passage of the legislation.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Antiquities Act was first signed into effect under the 26th President of the United States, all but four sitting presidents, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush have chosen to enlarge or dedicate new national monuments.[2]  President Obama in his last term in office erected the most monuments, under the Antiquities Act, than any President before him with 26. The President to have designated the highest number of monuments before President Obama was President Theodore Roosevelt with 18 monuments.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 26, 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing a review of the law and its uses.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Act was intended to allow the President to set aside certain valuable public natural areas as park and conservation land. The 1906 act stated that it was intended for: \\"... the protection of objects of historic and scientific interest.\\" These areas are given the title of \\"National Monuments.\\"  It also allows the President to reserve or accept private lands for that purpose.  The aim is to protect all historic and prehistoric sites on United States federal lands and to prohibit excavation or destruction of these antiquities.  With this act, this can be done much more quickly than going through the Congressional process of creating a National Park.  The Act states that areas of the monuments are to be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld presidential proclamations under the Antiquities Act, ruling each time that the Act gives the president nearly-unfettered discretion as to the nature of the object to be protected and the size of the area reserved.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome areas designated as National Monuments have later been converted into National Parks, or incorporated into existing National Parks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first use of the Act protected a large geographic feature?ÿ President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Devils Tower National Monument on September 24, 1906.[7] President Roosevelt also used it to create the Grand Canyon National Monument (now Grand Canyon National Park).\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 583,000 square miles (1,510,000?km2), Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument is the largest protected area proclaimed.[8] The smallest, Father Millet Cross National Monument (now part of a state park), was a mere 0.0074 acres (30?m2).[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor any excavation, the Act requires that a permit (Antiquities Permit) be obtained from the Secretary of the department which has jurisdiction over those lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresidential powers under the Act have been reduced twice.  The first time followed the unpopular proclamation of Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943.  The 1950 law that incorporated Jackson Hole into an enlarged Grand Teton National Park also amended the Antiquities Act, requiring Congressional consent for any future creation or enlargement of National Monuments in Wyoming.[10] The second time followed Jimmy Carter's use of the Act to create 56?million acres (230,000?km2) of National Monuments in Alaska.  The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act requires Congressional ratification of the use of the Antiquities Act in Alaska for withdrawals of greater than 5,000 acres (20?km2).[11] Under the Trump administration, all monuments dedicated after the year 1996 have been called into question. The Trump Administration is possibly looking to modify or even dismantle some of the monuments erected under the 1906 Antiquities Act.[12] Although some Presidents have chose to ignore the tradition of preservation of notable environmental or historic areas, no President to date has undone a predecessor's monument.[12]","input":"What was the purpose of the antiquities act?"},{"output":"American military and patriotic marches","context":"John Philip Sousa (/?su?s?/;[a]; November 6, 1854?ÿ March 6, 1932) was an American composer and conductor of the late Romantic era, known primarily for American military and patriotic marches. Because of his mastery of march composition, he is known as \\"The March King\\", or the \\"American March King\\" due to his British counterpart Kenneth J. Alford also being known by the former nickname. Among his best-known marches are \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" (National March of the United States of America), \\"Semper Fidelis\\" (Official March of the United States Marine Corps), \\"The Liberty Bell\\" (used as the theme for Monty Python's Flying Circus), \\"The Thunderer\\" and \\"The Washington Post\\".\\r\\nSousa began his career playing violin and studying music theory and composition under John Esputa and George Felix Benkert. His father enlisted him in the United States Marine Band as an apprentice in 1868. After departing the band in 1875, Sousa learned to conduct. From 1880 until his death, he focused exclusively on conducting and the writing of music. He eventually rejoined the Marine Band and served there for 12 years as director. On leaving the Marine Band, Sousa organized his own band. Sousa aided in the development of the sousaphone, a large brass instrument similar to the helicon and tuba. At the outbreak of World War I, Sousa was commissioned as a lieutenant commander and led the Naval Reserve Band in Illinois. Following his tenure, he returned to conduct the Sousa Band until his death in 1932. In the 1920s he was promoted to lieutenant commander in the naval reserve, but never saw active service again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Philip Sousa was born in Washington, D.C., the third of ten children of Jo?o Ant܇nio de Sousa (John Anthony Sousa) (Seville, 22 September 1824 - 27 April 1892), who was of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry (son of Jo?o Ant܇nio de Sousa and wife Josefina Blanco, from Seville), and his wife Maria Elisabeth Trinkhaus (Darmstadt, 20 May 1826 - 25 August 1908), who was of Hessian ancestry (daughter of Peter Trinkhaus and wife Catherine Schafers).[1][2][3] Sousa started his music education by playing the violin as a pupil of John Esputa and George Felix Benkert for harmony and musical composition at the age of six. He was found to have absolute pitch. During his childhood, Sousa studied voice, violin, piano, flute, cornet, baritone horn, trombone, and alto horn.[4] When Sousa was 13, his father, a trombonist in the Marine Band, enlisted him in the United States Marine Corps as an apprentice to keep him from joining a circus band.[5]\\r\\nSeveral years long after serving his apprenticeship, Sousa joined a theatrical (pit) orchestra where he learned to conduct. He returned to the U.S. Marine Band as its head in 1880 and remained as its conductor until 1892. Sousa led \\"The President's Own\\" band under five presidents from Rutherford B. Hayes to Benjamin Harrison. Sousa's band played at two Inaugural Balls, those of James A. Garfield in 1881, and Benjamin Harrison in 1889.[6][7] The marching brass bass, or sousaphone, a modified helicon, was created by J. W. Pepper?ÿ a Philadelphia instrument maker who created the instrument in 1893 at Sousa's request using several of his suggestions in its design. He wanted a tuba that could sound upward and over the band whether its player was seated or marching. The sousaphone was re-created in 1898 by C.G. Conn and this was the model that Sousa preferred to use.[8]\\r\\nHe organized The Sousa Band the year he left the Marine Band. The Sousa Band toured from 1892 to 1931, performing at 15,623 concerts[9] both in America and around the world,[10] including at the World Exposition in Paris, France and at the Royal Albert Hall in London.[2][11] In Paris, the Sousa Band marched through the streets to the Arc de Triomphe?ÿ one of only eight parades the band marched in over its forty years.[12]\\r\\nOn December 30, 1879, Sousa married Jane van Middlesworth Bellis (1862ÿ1944).[2] They had three children: John Philip, Jr. (April 1, 1881 ÿ May 18, 1937), Jane Priscilla (August 7, 1882 ÿ October 28, 1958), and Helen (January 21, 1887 ÿ October 14, 1975).[13] All were buried in the John Philip Sousa plot in the Congressional Cemetery. Wife Jane, daughters Jane Priscilla and Helen Abert joined the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) in 1907. Their ancestor was Adam Bellis, who served under several different commands for the New Jersey troops in the American Revolutionary War.[14]\\r\\nLate in his life, Sousa lived in Sands Point, New York. Sousa died of heart failure at the age of 77 on March 6, 1932, in his room at the Abraham Lincoln Hotel in Reading, Pennsylvania. He had conducted a rehearsal of \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" the previous day with the Ringgold Band. He is buried in Washington, D.C.'s Congressional Cemetery.[15] A school (John Philip Sousa Elementary) and a band shell were named after him and there was a memorial tree planted in nearby Port Washington, New York.[16] Wild Bank, his seaside house on Hicks Lane, has been designated a National Historic Landmark, although it remains a private home and is not open to the public.[17] He was posthumously enshrined in the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in 1976, one of just 102 Americans ever to be honored in such a manner.[2]\\r\\nSousa served two periods of service in the United States Marine Corps. He first enlisted on June 9, 1868 at the age of 13 as an apprentice musician. In official records, his initial rank was listed as \\"boy\\". He re-enlisted on July 8, 1872 and was promoted to musician. He left the Marine Corps in 1875 at the age of 20.\\r\\nHis second period of Marine service was from 1880 to 1892. During this period he was the leader of the Marine Band in Washington, D.C. (Some sources state that Sousa served with the rank of Sergeant Major and was eventually promoted to Warrant Officer but this is erroneous as the leader of the band was a separate rank from sergeant major and the Marine Corps did not have warrant officers until 1916.) [2] Sousa's salary as \\"leader of the band\\" (his official Marine Corps rank) was $83 per month which compared to a second lieutenant at $115.67 per month and a sergeant major with 20 years of service at $30 per month.[18]\\r\\nUnder his leadership, the Marine Band became the premier military band in the United States. The Columbia Phonograph Company produced 60 cylinders of recordings of the Marine Band conducted by Sousa. The recordings, along with two tours in 1891 and 1892, led to Sousa becoming nationally famous. During his time with the Marine Band, Sousa composed several of his famous marches including The Washington Post, The Thunderer and Semper Fidelis which remain staples of marching bands to this day.\\r\\nIn July 1892, Sousa requested, and received, a discharge from the Marine Corps to pursue a financially promising civilian career as a band leader. He conducted a farewell concert at the White House on July 30, 1892 and was discharged from the Marine Corps the next day.[19]\\r\\nOn May 31, 1917, shortly after the United States declared war on Germany and entered World War I, Sousa was commissioned as a lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve. At that time, Sousa was 62 years old which was then the mandatory retirement age for Navy officers. During the war, Sousa led the Navy Band at the Great Lakes Naval Station near Chicago, Illinois.[2][20] Being independently wealthy at this point in his life, he donated most of his naval salary, except a token $1 per month, to the Sailors' and Marines' Relief Fund.[21]\\r\\nSousa was discharged from active duty after the war's end in November 1918. He returned to conducting his own band but continued to wear his naval uniform for many of his concerts and other public appearances. In the early 1920s, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve but did not return to active duty.\\r\\nFor this service during the war, Sousa received the World War I Victory Medal. By right of his wartime service, he was elected as a Veteran Companion of the Military Order of Foreign Wars.\\r\\nSousa was decorated with the palms of the Order of Public Instruction of Portugal. He also received the Royal Victorian Medal from King Edward VII of the United Kingdom in December 1901 for conducting a private birthday concert for Queen Alexandra.[22][23]\\r\\nDuring World War II, the Liberty ship SS John Philip Sousa was named after him. The ship's bell is still used by the Marine Band in concert.\\r\\nSousa has a star in his honor at 1500 Vine Street on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\\r\\nIn 1976, Sousa was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. In 1998, he was inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame in Cincinnati, Ohio.\\r\\nThe band hall of the Marine Band was dedicated as \\"John Philip Sousa Band Hall.\\"\\r\\nIn 1987, an act of Congress named \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" as the National March of the United States.\\r\\nSousa wrote 137 marches, 15 operettas, 5 overtures, 11 suites, 24 dances, 28 fantasies, and 322 arrangements of nineteenth-century western European symphonic works.[24]\\r\\nSousa wrote 137 marches, published by Harry Coleman of Philadelphia, Carl Fischer Music, the John Church Company, and the Sam Fox Publishing Company, the last association beginning in 1917 and continuing until his death.[25] Some of his notable ones are:\\r\\nSousa wrote marches for several American universities, including the University of Minnesota,[30] University of Illinois,[31] University of Nebraska,[32] Kansas State University,[33] and Marquette University.[34]\\r\\nSousa wrote many notable operettas including:\\r\\nMarches and waltzes have been derived from many of these stage-works. Sousa also composed the music for six operettas that were either unfinished or not produced: The Devils' Deputy, Florine, The Irish Dragoon, Katherine, The Victory, and The Wolf.[36]\\r\\nIn addition, Sousa wrote a march based on themes from Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado, the elegant overture Our Flirtations, a number of musical suites, etc.[37] He frequently added Sullivan opera overtures or other Sullivan pieces to his concerts.[38] He was quoted saying, \\"My religion lies in my composition\\".[39]\\r\\nSousa had several additional interests outside of music. He wrote three novels?ÿ The Fifth String, Pipetown Sandy, and The Transit of Venus?ÿ as well as a full-length autobiography, Marching Along and numerous articles and letters-to-the-editor on a variety of subjects. He participated in trapshooting, taking an active role on the national stage in competitions.\\r\\nAs a trapshooter, he ranked as one of the all-time greats, and was enshrined in the Trapshooting Hall of Fame.[40] He organized the first national trapshooting organization, a forerunner to today's Amateur Trapshooting Association (ATA). Sousa remained active in the fledgling ATA for some time after its formation. Some credit Sousa as the father of organized trapshooting in United States. He also wrote numerous articles about trapshooting.[40] Sousa was a regular competitor representing the United States Navy in trapshooting competitions, particularly against the United States Army. Available records indicate that Sousa registered more than 35,000 targets during his shooting career.[41] A quote from his Trapshooting Hall of Fame biography says it best: \\"Let me say that just about the sweetest music to me is when I call, 'pull,' the old gun barks, and the referee in perfect key announces, 'dead'.\\"[40]\\r\\nIn his 1902 novel The Fifth String, a young violinist made a deal with the Devil for a magic violin with five strings. The first four strings of the violin excited the emotions of Pity, Hope, Love and Joy. The fifth string would cause the player's own death once played. When the violinist was unable to win the love of the woman he desired, he played upon the death string at what would be his final live concert.[42]\\r\\nIn 1905, Sousa published a book entitled Pipetown Sandy, which included a satirical poem titled \\"The Feast of the Monkeys\\". The poem described \\"a lavish party attended by variety of animals, however, overshadowed by the King of Beasts, the lion...who allows the muttering guests the privilege of watching him eat the entire feast\\". At the end of his gluttony, the lion explained, \\"Come all rejoice, You've seen your monarch dine.\\"[43]\\r\\nIn 1920, he wrote a 40,000-word story entitled \\"The Transit of Venus\\". The story recounts a group of misogynists called the Alimony Club who, as a way of temporarily escaping the society of women, embark on a sea voyage to observe the transit of Venus. The captain's niece, however, had stowed away on board and soon won over the men.[44]\\r\\nSousa also wrote a booklet entitled \\"A manual for trumpet and drum\\", published by the Ludwig drum company, with advice for playing drums and trumpet. An early version of the trumpet solo to \\"Semper Fidelis\\" was included in this volume.[45]\\r\\nSousa held a very low opinion of the emerging and upstart recording industry. Using an epithet coined by Mark Twain,[9] he derided recordings as \\"canned music\\", a reference to the early wax cylinder records that came in can-like cylindrical cardboard boxes. In a submission to a congressional hearing in 1906, he argued:\\r\\nThese talking machines are going to ruin the artistic development of music in this country. When I was a boy...in front of every house in the summer evenings, you would find young people together singing the songs of the day or old songs. Today you hear these infernal machines going night and day. We will not have a vocal cord left. The vocal cord will be eliminated by a process of evolution, as was the tail of man when he came from the ape.\\r\\nLaw professor Lawrence Lessig cited this passage[46] to argue that in creating a system of copyrights in which control of music is in the hands of record labels, Sousa was essentially correct.\\r\\nSousa's antipathy to recording was such that he almost never conducted his band when it was being recorded. Nevertheless, Sousa's band made numerous recordings, the earliest being issued on cylinders by several companies, followed by many recordings on discs by the Berliner Gramophone Company and its successor, the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor). The Berliner recordings were conducted by Henry Higgins (one of Sousa's cornet soloists) and Arthur Pryor (Sousa's trombone soloist and assistant conductor), with Sousa quoted as saying,[47] \\"I have never been in the gramophone company's office in my life.\\" A handful of the Victor recordings were actually conducted by Sousa, but most were conducted by Pryor, Herbert L. Clarke, Edwin H. Clarke, or by four of Victor's most prolific house musicians: Walter B. Rogers (who had also been a cornet soloist with Sousa), Rosario Bourdon, Josef Pasternack, and Nathaniel Shilkret.[47] Details of the Victor recordings are available in the external link below to the EDVR.\\r\\nSousa also appeared with his band in newsreels and on radio broadcasts (beginning with a 1929 nationwide broadcast on NBC).[2] In 1999, Legacy Records released some of Sousa's historic recordings on CD.[48] In 1922, he accepted the invitation of the national chapter to become an honorary member of Kappa Kappa Psi, the national honorary band fraternity.[49] In 1925, he was initiated as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music, by the fraternity's Alpha Xi chapter at the University of Illinois.[50][unreliable source?] In 1952, 20th Century Fox honored Sousa in their Technicolor feature film Stars and Stripes Forever with Clifton Webb portraying the composer. Fox music director Alfred Newman arranged the music and conducted the studio orchestra for the soundtrack. It was loosely based on Sousa's memoirs, Marching Along.[51]\\r\\nEven after death, Sousa continues to be remembered as \\"The March King\\" through The John Philip Sousa Foundation. The non-profit organization founded in 1981, recognizes one superior student in marching band for \\"musicianship, dependability, loyalty, and cooperation.\\"[52] The John Philip Sousa Foundation provides awards, scholarships, and projects such as The Sudler Trophy, The Sudler Shield, The Sudler Silver Scroll, The Sudler Flag of Honor, The Historic Roll of Honor, The Sudler Cup, The Hawkins Scholarship, National Young Artists, The National Community Band, and The Junior Honor Band Project.[53]\\r\\nArticles\\r\\nDissertations","input":"What type of music did john philip sousa write?"},{"output":"Upstate New York","context":"Charlie St. Cloud is a 2010 American drama film based on Ben Sherwood's best-selling novel, The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud published in 2004 by Bantam Books. The film is directed by Burr Steers and stars Zac Efron and Amanda Crew. The story is of Charlie St. Cloud's choice between keeping a promise he made to his brother, who died in a car accident, or going after the girl he loves. In some markets the film used the complete title of the book.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie St. Cloud is a sailor who wins a boating race on his sailboat, the Splendid Splinter, along with his younger brother Sam. In 2005, he receives a sailing scholarship to Stanford University. Charlie graduates from Winslow High School and after returning from his graduation ceremony, Charlie promises Sam that they will practice baseball every day until he leaves for Stanford. That night Charlie is supposed to go to a graduation party with his friends, but his mother makes him babysit Sam while she picks up another shift at her job.\\r\\nWhen Sam watches television, Charlie tries sneaking out to the party. He is caught by Sam, who asks Charlie to drive him to his friend Tommy's house. Charlie and Sam get into a car accident. During an out-of-body experience, Charlie hugs a badly wounded Sam and reassures him that everything will be fine.\\r\\nKnowing his injuries are fatal, Sam asks Charlie to never leave him alone, saying that if so they will always be together. As Charlie promises, a paramedic named Florio Ferrente revives Charlie; Sam has died in his arms. At Sam's funeral, Charlie runs off after being unable to put Sam's baseball glove in the grave. After a run through the woods, Charlie finds Sam's spirit and discovers that Sam can interact with him on the physical plane. Charlie fulfills Sam's dying wish by practicing baseball with him every day at sunset.\\r\\nFive years later, Charlie, who gave up his scholarship, is a caretaker at Waterside Cemetery. At the cemetery, he speaks with Sully, an old friend who died in the Marines. During a trip into town, Charlie visits the boat docks and meets Tess Carroll, a sailor planning to sail solo around the world. The following day, Charlie runs into Florio. Florio is dying of cancer and asks Charlie if he ever wonders why he was saved. Charlie returns to the cemetery and finds Tess injured tending her father's grave. He takes her to his home to patch her up and they develop a relationship. Sam begins feeling that he is being erased from existence because Charlie is forgetting him when Charlie arrives late for their game. Tess follows Charlie and he explains to her that the more he is in her world, the less he is in Sam's.\\r\\nCharlie discovers that Tess went missing while sailing through a storm a few days earlier; Charlie has been seeing her just like he can Sam. Florio's wife Carla tells Charlie that Florio died the previous night. During one of the evenings Charlie and Tess have together they play hide and seek. Tess sticks a note on the door which says \\"come find me\\" with a drawing of a boat beneath it. Charlie realizes that Tess is not dead and that he must find her.\\r\\nAlong with his friend Alistair and Tess's coach Tink, Charlie takes a boat to find her. The following sunset, Charlie misses his game with Sam. As Charlie confesses his love for his departed sibling, Sam tells Charlie that he loves him back and moves on from the living world. He appears to Charlie as a shooting star in the sky to reveal Tess' location. The group finds Tess' wrecked boat along with her lying on the rocks. Charlie uses his body heat to keep Tess warm until they are found by the Coast Guard.\\r\\nAlistair tells Charlie that Tess had hypothermia and he saved her. Later, Charlie purchases an old dilapidated sail boat from a family-friend and asks Tess if she would like to take a ride with him. However, Tess fears him explaining that she had vivid dreams about them together. Charlie tells Tess that her dreams are memories and recites a quote from her father's funeral that they spoke about in her dreams. Charlie resigns from his job and goes into the forest to say farewell to Sam, telling him they will always be brothers; although he is unable to see him, Sam is there and reveals that he is at peace. Sometime in the near future, Charlie and Tess complete repairs to the sail boat and set off to sail around the world.\\r\\nA bidding war for the film rights to the book by author Ben Sherwood broke out in April and May 2003, before the book was published.[2] Three studios competed for the rights.[2] Universal Studios and Marc Platt (Universal's president of production) won the right to make the book into a film, paying a reported $500,000 to $1 million for the rights (with that figure rising above $1 million if the film is made).[2] Ben Sherwood was guaranteed an executive producer credit on the film, and Universal Studios executive producer Donna Langley was assigned to the picture.[2] Joe Johnston was initially chosen to direct.[3]\\r\\nDrafts for the script were written by James Schamus and Lewis Colick,[4][5] but the final script was written by Craig Pearce.[4][6] By March 2009, Johnston had been replaced as director by Burr Steers, and Platt had named himself as producer.[4][6] Steers helped polish the script.[6] The first lead performer cast in the film was Zac Efron, who turned down the lead role in Paramount Pictures' remake of Footloose to star in this film.[4][7][8] Pre-production had commenced by March 2009, with filming set to begin in July 2009.[4]\\r\\nTraining with Efron began in Vancouver, British Columbia, in July 2009,[9] and started production in Upstate New York July 2009 to October 5.[10] Actress Amanda Crew joined the film as Tess Carroll in July 2009,[11] and was shooting her scenes the following September.[12] Quite a few scenes in the film were shot in Gibsons, British Columbia, including a scene in the famous 'Beachcombers' restaurant.[13] Some of the film was also filmed at a Deep Cove school, Seycove Secondary School, in North Vancouver, B.

The mission was founded on June 13, 1798 by Padre Fermn Lasun, and was the eighteenth of the Spanish missions established in California. Named for Saint Louis, the mission lent its name to the Luise?o tribe of Mission Indians.\\r\\nThe current church, built in 1811, is the third church on this location.[15] It is a National Historic Landmark, for its pristine example of a Spanish mission church complex.[14][16][17] Today the mission complex functions as a parish church of the Diocese of San Diego as well as a museum and retreat center. Mission San Luis Rey De Francia raised about 26,000 cattle as well as goats, geese, and pigs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first non-natives to see the mission site were members of the 1769 Portola expedition. Padre Juan Crespi noted in his diary on July 18 that it would be a good spot for future establishment of a mission. He named the place \\"San Juan Capistrano\\", but that name was used instead for the mission founded further north in 1776.[18] The area became a standard camping stop on the road connecting the missions, until the mission establishment 29 years later.\\r\\nThe original name La Misi܇n de San Luis, Rey de Francia (The Mission of Saint Louis, King of France) was named for King Louis IX of France.[1][2] Its 'nickname' was \\"King of the Missions\\"[3] It was founded by padre Fermn Lasun on June 12, 1798, the eighteenth of the twenty-one Spanish missions built in the Alta California Province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.[2][4][5] At its prime, Mission San Luis Rey's structures and services compound covered almost 950,400 acres (3.846G109?m2), making it one of the largest of the missions, along with its surrounding agricultural land.[19] Two outposts were built in support of Mission San Luis Rey and placed under its supervision: San Antonio de Pala Asistencia in 1816 and Las Flores Estancia in 1823.\\r\\nAn early account of life at the Mission was written by one of its Native American converts, Luise?o Pablo Tac, in his work Indian Life and Customs at Mission San Luis Rey: A Record of California Mission Life by Pablo Tac, An Indian Neophyte (written c.1835 in Rome, later edited and translated in 1958 by Minna Hewes and Gordon Hewes). In his book, Tac lamented the rapid population decline of his Luise?o people after the founding of the mission:\\r\\n\\"In Quechla not long ago there were 5,000 souls, with all their neighboring lands. Through a sickness that came to California, 2,000 souls died, and 3,000 were left.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe Mission-born, Franciscan-educated Tac wrote that his people initially attempted to bar the Spaniards from invading their Southern California lands. When the foreigners approached:\\r\\n\\"...the chief stood up...and met them,\\" demanding, \\"...what are you looking for? Leave our Country!\\"\\r\\nPablo Tac went on to describe the preferential conditions and treatment the padres received:\\r\\n\\"In the mission of San Luis Rey de Francia the Fernandi?o  [sic] father is like a king. He has his pages, alcaldes, majordomos, musicians, soldiers, gardens, ranchos, livestock....\\"[20]\\r\\nThe first Peruvian Pepper Tree (Schinus molle) in California was planted here in 1830, now iconic, widely planted, and renamed the California Pepper tree in the state. After the Mexican secularization act of 1833 much of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia land was sold off. During the MexicanÿAmerican War in Alta California (1846ÿ1847), the Mission was utilized as a military outpost by the United States Army.[19]\\r\\nIn July 1847, U.S. military governor of California Richard Barnes Mason created an Indian sub-agency at Mission San Luis Rey, and his men took charge of the mission property in August, appointing Jesse Hunter from the recently arrived Mormon Battalion as sub-agent. Battalion guide Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, the Native American Shoshone child of Sacagawea who had traveled with the Lewis and Clark Expedition forty years earlier, was appointed by Mason as the Alcalde \\"within the District of San Diego, at or near San Luis Rey\\" in November 1847. Charbonneau resigned from the post in August, 1898, claiming that \\"because of his Indian heritage others thought him biased when problems arose between the Indians and the other inhabitants of the district.\\"[21]\\r\\nWith secularization of the mission in 1834, no religious services were held and the Luise?o were left behind by the fleeing Franciscan padres. The Mission's religious services restarted in 1893, when two Mexican priests were given permission to restore the Mission as a Franciscan college.[19] Father Joseph O'Keefe was assigned as an interpreter for the monks. It was he who began to restore the old Mission in 1895. The cuadrngulo (quadrangle) and church were completed in 1905. San Luis Rey College was opened as a seminary in 1950, but closed in 1969.\\r\\nEpisodes 2, 3, 4 and 12 of the Disney-produced Zorro TV series include scenes filmed in 1957 at San Luis Rey, which doubled for the Mission of San Gabriel; Disney added a skull and crossbones to the cemetery entrance. In 1998, Sir Gilbert Levine led members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and, with the special permission of Pope John Paul II, the ancient Cappella Giulia Choir of St. Peter's Basilica, in a series of concerts to commemorate the 900th anniversary of the founding of the mission. These festival concerts constituted the first-ever visit of this 500-year-old choir to the Western Hemisphere. The concerts were broadcast on NPR's Performance Today. In February 2013, the seismic retrofiting was completed.[22]\\r\\nToday, Mission San Luis Rey de Francia is a working mission, cared for by the people who belong to the parish, with ongoing restoration projects.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, Rolling Stone magazine editor and publisher Jann S. Wenner, attorney Allen Grubman, and record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of Bill Haley and American Bandstand), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.[citation needed]\\r\\nCleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \\"rock and roll\\" and heavily promoted the new genreand that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 80s, including artist David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush among many others.[2] Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.\\r\\nCivic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 USA Today poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland. \\"The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly,\\" wrote Peter Guralnick, author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.[3]\\r\\nCleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As The Plain Dealer music critic Michael Norman noted, \\"It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money.\\" Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, \\"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place,\\" but then added, \\"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\\"\\r\\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium.\\r\\nAt one point in the planning phase when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200?ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162?ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Billy Joel, Sam Phillips, Ruth Brown, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking.\\r\\nThe museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.\\r\\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.[4]\\r\\nSince 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986ÿ92, 1994ÿ96, 1998ÿ2008, 2010ÿ11, 2014, 2016 and 2017); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012 and 2015). Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.[5]\\r\\nThe 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a publicÿprivate partnership between the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.[6]\\r\\nMillions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.[7]\\r\\nThere are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm & blues and folk, country and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London and Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, Atlantic Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.[8]\\r\\nThe first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \\"Backstage Stories.\\" The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips and the evolution of audio technology.[9]\\r\\nVisitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \\"The Power of Rock Experience,\\" which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies.[10] Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.[11][12]\\r\\nFinally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, Bruce Springsteen, Women Who Rock, and the Rolling Stones.\\r\\nDesigned by I. M. Pei and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of bold geometric forms and dynamic cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \\"tent\\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\\r\\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a caf.\\r\\n\\"In designing this building,\\" Pei said, \\"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\\" [13]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\\r\\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 ÿ 1969. It included artifacts from numerous artists, including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, the Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as artifacts related to the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock.\\r\\nThat exhibit was followed by Elvis is in the Building, an exhibit about the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career.[14] Next, the museum curated Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by Rock Style, an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, from Ray Charles to David Bowie and from Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, Rock Style traveled to other museums in the U.S.\\r\\nOther temporary exhibits have included Lennon: His Life and Work, which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2 and then Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection. A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.[15]\\r\\nOther large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash), the Doors (Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors), the Who's Tommy (Tommy: The Amazing Journey), and Bruce Springsteen (From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine Rolling Stone.[16]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th anniversary, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, and John Mellencamp.\\r\\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford,[17] and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.[18][19]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll. Every February, the museum celebrates Black History Month[20] by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.\\r\\nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.\\r\\nA similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\\r\\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008),[21] Janis Joplin (2009),[22] Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011),[23] and Chuck Berry (2012).[24]\\r\\n Hall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \\"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\\", created an unordered list of \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\".[25][26] The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.[27] It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The Beatles with seven songs was the most represented on the 500ÿsong list. The oldest song on the list is \\"Wabash Cannonball\\", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 155 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \\"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" and My Chemical Romance's \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\", both released in 2006.[28] The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 660ÿsong list, with eight songs each.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Simon & Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony & the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.[29][30][31]\\r\\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. Generally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters. The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences, John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\\r\\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \\"Performers\\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.[32]\\r\\nIn 2012, six additional groups, the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets, were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \\"There was a lot of discussion about this,\\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \\"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question ÿ it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\\"[33]\\r\\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily country, folk, jazz, and blues, whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musicians Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \\"rock era\\".\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Non-Performers\\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters and music journalists. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.[34]\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Sidemen\\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \\"Award for Musical Excellence\\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \\"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\\"[35]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\\r\\nThe Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\\r\\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.\\r\\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.[36][37][38]\\r\\nThe most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder Jann Wenner (co-founder and editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \\"At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\\"[39] Sister Rosetta Tharpe is often considered \\"The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll\\",[40][41] but was not chosen for induction until 2017. Also, the influential soul/funk group Tower of Power has not yet been honored. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the \\"Hall of Lame\\".[42]\\r\\nThere is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of The New York Times wrote:\\r\\n\\"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders ÿ and committee members say they want to keep it that way.\\"[43]\\r\\nJon Landau, the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. \\"We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.\\"[43]\\r\\nAccording to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all.[39] The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres.[44] According to author Brett Milano, \\"entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music.\\"[45] In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous hip hop artists have been inducted, including Tupac Shakur (class of 2017), N.W.A (class of 2016) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (class of 2007).[46]\\r\\nAnother criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.[47] A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.[47] The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.[48]\\r\\nMembers of the British punk rock band The Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \\"a piss stain\\" and \\"urine in wine\\".[49]\\r\\nIn BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, the singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \\"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\\"[50][51] In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%.[52] Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which only 61 have been women, none of which has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.[53]\\r\\n2016 inductee Steve Miller voiced a litany of criticisms directed at the hall, both during his induction speech and, especially, in interviews after it. His complaints included a lack of female inductees, not enough support by the hall for music education, and treatment of inductees at the award ceremony.[54]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article claiming that the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say \\"Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act.\\"[46]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation would later deny fixing the vote, although they did not deny that late votes were received, saying, \\"No. There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\\"[55] The Dave Clark Five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.[56]\\r\\nIn June 2007, Monkee Peter Tork complained to the New York Post that Wenner had blackballed the Monkees, commenting:\\r\\n[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, 'What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.' [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.\\r\\nIn a Facebook post, fellow Monkee Michael Nesmith stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and further stated: \\"I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\\"[57]\\r\\nVarious magazines and news outlets, such as Time,[58] NPR radio,[59] The Christian Science Monitor,[60] Goldmine magazine,[61][62] Yahoo Music[63] and MSNBC [64] have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","input":"When was the rock and roll hall of fame established?"},{"output":"The Little Mermaid","context":"","input":"What was the first computer animated disney movie?"},{"output":"a theme park located in Orlando, Florida","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversal's Islands of Adventure (formally called Universal Studios Islands of Adventure and often shortened to Islands of Adventure) is a theme park located in Orlando, Florida. It opened on May 28, 1999, along with CityWalk, as part of an expansion that converted Universal Studios Florida into the Universal Orlando Resort. The resort's slogan Vacation Like You Mean It was introduced in 2013.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIslands of Adventure is modeled after a journey of exploration, where guests embark on an adventure to visit a variety of themed islands. Initially, the park featured six islands. A seventh, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, was added in 2010, themed to the popular Harry Potter franchise. It was Universal's largest investment since the resort's founding in 1990. The expansion led to a significant increase in attendance, and in 2013, Islands of Adventure ranked seventh domestically and eleventh internationally after hosting approximately 8.1 million guests.[3] The eighth island, Skull Island, opened on July 13, 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Universal Studios Florida next door, Islands of Adventure has not limited itself to Universal's own library, because it licensed other characters from rival studios, many of whom did not own theme parks of their own, as attractions and lands. Some of these include: \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Islands of Adventure was built, the site was originally planned as a shopping mall called Galleria Orlando.[4] Plans were first drawn up for the mall in 1985, but it was ultimately canceled in 1990.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the construction of the park, Universal opened a Preview Center (known as the Islands of Adventure Preview Center) at adjacent Universal Studios Florida. Opening two years before the new theme park, the Preview Center was designed to give guests a sneak peek at some of the themes and attractions for Islands of Adventure. The attraction was located in the Paradise Theater building located in the New York section of Universal Studios Florida, next to the Kongfrontation attraction. In the attraction, guests would walk through various rooms themed to the various \\"Islands\\" in the new park. The final room stated when the Islands of Adventure park would open, and showed guests Universal's future plans for the Universal Orlando Resort. The Preview Center was closed shortly after the opening of Islands of Adventure.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIslands of Adventure had a soft opening beginning March 27, 1999,[7] during which visitors could preview the park at a discounted price while the staff conducted a technical rehearsal and worked on the \\"finishing touches.\\" During this soft opening, guests were informed that attractions might open and close throughout the day without notice and that some attractions might not be open at all. Initial plans were to open the park in mid-May, but this was ultimately delayed until May 28, 1999.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the enormous capital expenditure required to build Islands of Adventure, CityWalk, and the resort hotels, Universal sought to overtake nearby Walt Disney World in attendance. However, with the addition of the second park, new resorts, and entertainment district, the resort was named Universal Studios Escape. Essentially, it seemed that visitors were confused by the name, assuming that Islands of Adventure was a new area added to the already-existing Universal Studios Florida theme park. For the first two years, attendance did not rise as expected.[10] By 2001, the marketing was revamped, clarifying that Islands of Adventure was indeed a second, completely separate park with new rides and attractions. Universal Studios Escape was renamed Universal Orlando Resort, and ended up being the only resort in the Orlando area to actually have an increase in attendance after the September 11 attacks on the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with almost any amusement park, older attractions are sometimes removed to make way for newer ones. At Islands of Adventure, some have simply been closed with no replacement like Island Skipper Tours while others like Poseidon's Fury were changed from their initial concept to the attraction that operates today.\\r\\n\\r\\nIslands of Adventure consists of eight themed \\"islands\\", the majority of which are based on licensed intellectual properties, with only two lands based on original Universal Studios works. They are, in clockwise order from entry: Port of Entry, Marvel Super Hero Island, Toon Lagoon, Skull Island, Jurassic Park, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, The Lost Continent, and Seuss Landing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPort of Entry is the park's main entrance and is home to many shops and services including Guest Services aptly named The Open Arms Hotel. The park's centerpiece, Pharos Lighthouse, is also located within Port of Entry. Each night, this real, functioning lighthouse sends out a bright beam to lead visitors to and from the park's gates. Like many theme parks using the \\"hub and spokes\\" format, this entry Island contains no rides, and is primarily noted for its boulevard of restaurants and shops.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarvel Super Hero Island is based on the superhero characters featured in Marvel Comics. The area features comic-book styled architecture; many of the building interiors are created in comic book perspective, with exaggerated lines and angles. Many exteriors are painted in a special paint which appears to change color based on the angle from which it is viewed ÿ sometimes purple, sometimes orange. The buildings are all labelled generically: \\"Store,\\" \\"Shop,\\" \\"Food,\\" and \\"Comics\\", etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area is home to a variety of dining outlets and merchandise shops. Food and beverage items can be purchased from Cafe 4 and Captain America Diner. Merchandise items can be bought from a variety of themed stores including Spider-Man Shop (The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man), Marvel Alterniverse Store, Comic Book Shop, and Oakley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Incredible Hulk Coaster confronts guests as they enter the area with an attention-grabbing roar. Hulk is a high speed launched steel roller coaster which has a top speed of 67 miles per hour (108?km/h). It closed on September 8, 2015 for major refurbishments and reopened in summer 2016. Storm Force Accelatron is a teacups ride themed after X-Men.[21] Doctor Doom's Fearfall is a pair of S&S Power Space Shot attractions themed after the Fantastic Four. The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man is a 3-D simulator ride based on the character Spider-Man. The ride is set in New York as Spider-Man prevents The Sinister Syndicate from taking the Statue of Liberty. \\"Meet Spider-Man and the Marvel Super Heroes\\" is a meet-and-greet attraction, where guests can meet superheroes including Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops and Rogue, Spider-Man, and Captain America.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2009, The Walt Disney Company (Universal's biggest competitor in the theme park market) announced that it had sought to acquire Marvel Entertainment. Universal announced that Marvel's new ownership would not affect Marvel Super Hero Island, and Disney CEO Bob Iger acknowledged that Disney would continue to honor any contracts that Marvel currently has with Disney competitors.[22] In March 2012, Bob Iger revealed that Disney had begun preliminary concepts of incorporating Marvel's properties into their parks, although no major negotiations with Universal were announced.[23][24] Hong Kong Disneyland has since announced an expansion to its park featuring characters from the Marvel Universe.[25] Disney California Adventure Park at the Disneyland Resort in California has also since incorporated meet-and-greet Marvel characters, as well as an Avengers Super Hero Half Marathon Weekend at the resort. Both Hong Kong Disneyland and Disney California Adventure have opened Marvel attractions since the acquisition, with Iron Man Experience at the former and Guardians of the Galaxy ÿ Mission: Breakout! at the latter. Both attractions officially opened in 2017. Only Walt Disney World Resort and Tokyo Disney Resort are barred from having Marvel characters in its parks, due to contractual obligations to Universal and Universal's use of Marvel characters in the region.[26] However, this only includes characters Universal is currently using, other characters in their \\"families\\" (Spider-Man, X-Men, Avengers, Fantastic Four, etc.), the villains associated with said characters, and the Marvel name.[27] This clause has allowed Walt Disney World to have meet and greets, merchandise, attractions, and more with other Marvel characters not associated with the characters at Islands of Adventure, such as Star-Lord and Gamora from Guardians of the Galaxy.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nToon Lagoon is based on the cartoon characters of King Features Syndicate and Jay Ward. The area focuses on water-based rides (hence the name) and features three counter-service restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nToon Lagoon features three main attractions. Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls is a traditional log flume combined with roller coaster track based on the Dudley Do-Right character. Popeye and Bluto's Bilge-Rat Barges is a river rafting water ride themed after Popeye the Sailor saving Olive Oyl from Bluto. Me Ship, the Olive is a kids' playground built in and around Popeye's ship. The three levels of the ship all contain a variety of interactive elements including cannons and hoses which can further soak riders on the Popeye and Bluto's Bilge-Rat Barges ride. Mat Hoffman's Aggro Circus is a live seasonal BMX stunt show at the Toon Lagoon Theater which operates during spring break and summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSkull Island is the most recently opened island at the theme park. The area's sole attraction, Skull Island: Reign of Kong, opened on July 13, 2016. This attraction and island marks the return of the King Kong character to the Universal Orlando Resort, after the Kongfrontation attraction closed at Universal Studios Florida in 2002 to make way for the Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride.\\r\\n\\r\\nJurassic Park is themed to the film series of the same name. Set after the events of the first film, the area undertakes the guise of the John Hammond's dinosaur theme park featured in the series. As such, the area is filled with the attractions and exhibits one would find in the \\"real\\" Jurassic Park, including thrill rides and discovery-based exhibits.\\r\\n\\r\\nJurassic Park features five main attractions. Jurassic Park River Adventure, constructed by Superior Rigging & Erection,[30] is a water ride based on Steven Spielberg's first film and Michael Crichton's novel.\\r\\n\\r\\nTriceratops Discovery Trail (formerly Triceratops Encounter) is a walkthrough attraction where guests can get up close and interact with a full-scale animated replica of a Triceratops, while a \\"veterinary technician\\" performs a semi-annual exam on the Trike.[31][32] The attraction actually features three different Trikes ÿ Topper, Chris, and Cera.[33][34] All 3 are female. Chris was named after a member of the team that created the dinosaurs who died before the attraction opened.[34] Spar Aerospace (now known as MD Robotics) was contracted to construct the three robotic trikes, each of which are 9 metres (30?ft) long and 3 metres (9.8?ft) high. Universal requested specific requirements for the robots including the ability to replicate breathing (through synchronised rib cage movements), sneezing, snorting, urinating and flatulating.[35][36] Due to maintenance and staffing issues, the trail was closed off in 2005. However, after five years, the attraction reopened in December 2010 for seasonal operation before it was permanently closed in 2012.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nPteranodon Flyers is a steel suspended roller coaster manufactured by Setpoint USA. Riders join the queue located within Camp Jurassic. Pteranodon Flyers features three two-seater cars suspended on a track. The cars are pulled up a hill and then travel a circuit around Camp Jurassic at low speed before returning to the station.[37][38] Due to the low capacity of the ride, only those who are between 36?and?56?inches (91?and?140?cm) or those with a child of that height may ride.[37] The Universal Express pass cannot be used on this attraction due to the ride's low capacity.[39][40] A similar ride, Canopy Flyer exists at Universal Studios Singapore.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nCamp Jurassic is a children's play area centered around an imported 50-foot (15?m) tall Banyan tree. It features a variety of play elements including slides, nets, water cannons and fountains. Pteranodon Flyers' queue is located within Camp Jurassic.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wizarding World of Harry Potter ÿ Hogsmeade is themed around the Harry Potter universe, authored by J. K. Rowling. It officially opened to the public on June 18, 2010. On May 31, 2007, Universal announced that it had secured the licensing rights from Warner Bros. and Rowling to incorporate the Harry Potter franchise to Islands of Adventure.[43] The 20-acre (81,000?m2) island features attractions, shops, and restaurants set inside such locations as the Forbidden Forest, Hogsmeade Village, Diagon Alley, and the iconic Hogwarts Castle. Ground breaking began in 2007, with the official opening scheduled for June 18, 2010, as announced on March 25, 2010. As part of the promotion for the then-upcoming area, a behind-the-scenes documentary on production of the park section is included on the Blu-ray and DVD release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, there are five main attractions. Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, the section's signature attraction, is located inside Hogwarts Castle and takes guests through scenes inspired by the Potter books and films.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlight of the Hippogriff, previously known as Flying Unicorn, is a Vekoma junior roller coaster.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hogwarts Express is a train ride that transports visitors between The Wizarding World - Hogsmeade in Universal's Islands of Adventure and The Wizarding World - Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\nOllivanders is an interactive shopping experience based on the Harry Potter Ollivanders wand shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a singing Frog Choir and a Triwizard Spirit Rally held in the town center. These events feature Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang students.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn expansion of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, based on the Diagon Alley and London settings from the series, opened on July 8, 2014 at the adjacent Universal Studios Florida park in the former site of the park's Jaws attraction. The Hogwarts Express attraction connects the two areas of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in each park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area's sole roller coaster, Dragon Challenge, was closed on September 4, 2017 to make way for a brand new Potter-themed coaster, set to open in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lost Continent is themed to ancient myths and legends, and is divided into two sub-sections; an ancient Arabian marketplace called Sinbad's Bazzaar, and a Grecian-Atlantis-esque Lost City. Formerly, the Lost Continent included a medieval section Merlinwood, but the majority of that area was re-themed for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Today the area contains two live-action shows. This land is also home to Mythos, which is one of two full-service restaurants in the park and was voted winner of best theme park restaurant by Theme Park Insider for six successive years between 2003 and 2008.[46][47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three main attractions in the Lost Continent. The Eighth Voyage of Sinbad is a live-action stunt show located in the ancient Arabia section. In front of this show is The Mystic Fountain that entertains and interacts with guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoseidon's Fury is an indoor special-effects show located in the Lost City section.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeuss Landing is based on the works of author Dr. Seuss. The island features several Seuss-themed attractions, especially geared towards small children, as well as a Green Eggs and Ham Cafe and Circus McGurkus restaurant. As in the books, one of the unique characteristics of this area is that there is not a single straight line anywhere.[49] Palm trees bent by the winds of Hurricane Andrew were even planted in the area to continue this theme.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area is home to a variety of dining outlets and merchandise shops. Food and beverage items can be purchased from Circus McGurkus Cafe Stoo-pendous (The High in the Sky Seuss Trolley Train Ride), Green Eggs and Ham Cafe (opened seasonally), Hop on Pop Ice Cream Shop, and Moose Juice, Goose Juice.

Partners in LDRs face geographic separation and lack of face-to-face contact. LDRs are particularly prevalent among college students- constituting 25% to 50% of all relationships.[1] Even though scholars have reported a significant number of LDRs in undergraduate populations, long-distance relationships continue to be an understudied' phenomenon.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLDRs are qualitatively different from geographically close relationships; that is, relationships in which the partners are able to see each other, face-to-face, most days. According to Rohlfing (1995) he suggests the following unique challenges for those in long-distance relationships:\\r\\nNot all long-distance relationships are romantic. When individuals go away to school, their relationships with family and friends also become long-distance. Pew Internet (2004) asserts that 79% of adult respondents from the United States reported using the Internet for communication with family and friends.[3] Also, Pew Internet (2002a) states that because of new technologies, college students will have greater social ties with their friends than their family members. Therefore, examining email among college students helps explore how the Internet is affecting college students emotionally and socially.[4]\\r\\nThe partners of military personnel deployed abroad experience a significant amount of stress, before and during the deployment. The difference between a military LDR and a regular LDR is that, while the regular LDR there is more communication the military LDR communication is unexpected and controlled by military regulations or there is not much time to talk. Because of the communication restrictions and the overall process of deployment, this leaves the partner back home feeling lonely, and stressing on how to keep a strong relationship moving forward.[5] Other stressors that add to the emotional situation are the realization that the service member is being deployed to a combat zone where his life is threatened. Through all the stages of the deployment the partner will exhibit many emotional problems, such as anxiety, loss, denial, anger, depression, and acceptance.[5]\\r\\nIn 2005 a survey suggested that in the United States 14 to 15 million people were considered to be in a long-distance relationship. In 2015 closer to 14 million people considered themselves to be in a long-distance relationship. About 32.5% of college relationships are long-distance. The average amount of distance in a long-distance relationship is 125 miles. Couples in a long-distance relationship call each other every 2.7 days. On average couples in a long-distance relationships will visit each other 1.5 times a month. Also couples in long-distance relationships expect to live together around 14 months into the relationship. About 40% of couples in long-distance relationships break up; around 4.5 months into the relationship is the time when couples most commonly start having problems. Also 70% of couples in a long-distance relationship break up due to unplanned circumstances and events. About 75% of couples in long-distance relationships end up being engaged at some point in the relationship. Around 10% of couples still maintain a long-distance relationship after marriage. About 3.75 million married couples are in a long-distance relationship in the US alone.[6]\\r\\nNew communication technologies such as cellular phone plans make communication among individuals at a distance easier than in the past.[7] Before the popularity of internet dating, long-distance relationships were not as common, as the primary forms of communication between the romance lovers usually involved either telephone conversations or corresponding via mail. According to Pew Internet, American citizens were asked how often they used the Internet on a typical day, they reported 56% sending or reading email, 10% reported sending instant messages, and 9% reported using an online social network such as Facebook[8] or Twitter. However, with the advent of the Internet, long-distance relationships have exploded in popularity as they become less challenging to sustain with the use of modern technology.\\r\\nThe increase in long-distance relationships is matched by an increasing number of technologies designed specifically to support intimate couples living apart. In particular there have been a host of devices which have attempted to mimic co-located behaviours at a distance including hand-holding,[9] leaving love notes,[10] hugging[11] and even kissing.[12] The success of these technologies has, so far, been limited.\\r\\nCouples who have routine, strategic relational maintenance behaviors, and take advantage of social media can help maintain a long-distance relationship.[13] Having positivity (making interactions cheerful and pleasant), openness (directly discussing the relationship and one's feelings), assurances (reassuring the partner about the relationship and the future), network (relying on support and love of others), shared tasks (performing common tasks) and conflict management (giving the partner advice) are some of the routine and strategic relation maintenance behaviors [14]\\r\\nIntimate relationship partners constantly work to improve their relationship. There are many ways in which they can make their partner happy and strengthen the overall relationship[15]. The ways in which individuals behave have a major effect on the satisfaction and the durability of the relationship. Researchers have found systems of maintenance behaviors between intimate partners. Maintenance behaviors can be separated into seven categories: assurances in relation to love and commitment in the relationship, openness in sharing their feelings, conflict management, positive interactions, sharing tasks, giving advice to their partner, and using social networks for support (Dainton, 2000; Stafford, Dainton, & Haas, 2000).\\r\\nDindia and Emmers-Sommer (2006) identified three categories of maintaining behaviors that are used by partners to deal with separation. \\"Prospective behaviors, such as telling the partner goodbye, which addresses anticipated separation; introspective behaviors, which is communication when the partners are apart; and retrospective behaviors which are basically talking to each other face to face, which reaffirms connection after separation.\\" (Dindia, & Emmers-Sommer, 2006). These are known as the relationship continuity constructional units (RCCUs). Maintenance behaviors as well as the RCCUs are correlated with an increase in relationship satisfaction, as well as, commitment (Pistole et al., 2010).\\r\\nIn a study of jealousy experience, expression, in LDR's, 114 individuals who were in LDR's indicated how much face-to-face contact they had during a typical week. Thirty-three percent of participants reported no face-to-face contact, whereas 67% reported periodic face-to-face contact with a mean of 1 to 2 days.[16] The researchers compared LDRs to GCRs (geographically close relationships) and discovered that those in LDRs with no face-to-face contact experience more jealousy than those with periodic face-to-face contact or those in GCRs. Furthermore, those without periodic face-to-face contact were more likely to use the Internet to communicate with their partner. They found that the presence of periodic face-to-face contact is a crucial factor in the satisfaction, commitment, and trust of LDR partners. Those who do not experience periodic face-to-face contact reported significantly lower levels of satisfaction, commitment, and trust.\\r\\nAnother study generated a sample of 335 undergraduate students who were in LDRs and became geographically close.[17] Of the reunited couples, 66 individuals terminated their relationships after moving to the same location, whereas 114 continued their relationship.\\r\\nBased on the analysis of the open-ended responses, 97% of respondents noted some type of relationship change associated with the LD-GC (geographically close) transition. When the respondents were asked about having the ability to have more face-to-face time when GC, and the enjoyment of increased time spent together most comments were positive. For example, We finally got to do all the \\"little\\" things we'd been wanting to do for so long; we get to hold each other, wake up next to each other, eat together, etc.' Many Individuals reported a loss of autonomy, following reunion. For example, many individuals liked and missed the \\"freedom\\" or \\"privacy\\" the distance allowed. Reports of \\"nagging\\", demanding or expecting \\"too much\\" were also frequent responses. Several individuals reported more conflict and fighting' in their relationship after it became geographically close. Many said they felt the conflict in their relationship was not only more frequent but also more difficult to resolve. For example, one individual stated that, when his relationship was long-distance, he and his partner fought less and if we did fight, problems were solved in a shorter amount of time. For some individuals living in the same location led to increased feelings of jealousy. After witnessing their partners' behaviour, some participants said that they became increasingly concerned that their partners were currently cheating' on them or had cheated on them in the past.' Reunion allowed the discovery of positive as well as negative characteristics about their partner, feeling that the partner had changed in some way since the relationship was long-distance.","input":"When is it considered a long distance relationship?"},{"output":"poblano chilis","context":"Chiles en nogada is a dish, traditionally served at room temperature with cold cream sauce, from Mexican cuisine. The name comes from the Spanish word for the walnut tree, nogal.[1] It consists of poblano chilis filled with picadillo (a mixture usually containing shredded meat, aromatics, fruits and spices) topped with a walnut-based cream sauce, called nogada, and pomegranate seeds, giving it the three colors of the Mexican flag: green from the chili, white from the nut sauce and red from the pomegranate. The walnut used to prepare nogada is a cultivar called Nogal de Castilla or Castillan Walnut.\\r\\nThe traditional chile en nogada is from Puebla; it is tied to the independence of this country since it is said they were prepared for the first time to entertain the emperor Agustn de Iturbide when he came to the city after his naming as Agustn I. This dish is a source of pride for the inhabitants of the state of Puebla.[2]\\r\\nSome Mexican historians believe the inventors of this dish were the Monjas Clarisas, although others think they were the Madres Contemplativas Agustinas of the convent of Santa M܇nica, Puebla.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe picadillo usually contains panochera apple (manzana panochera), sweet-milk pear (pera de leche) and criollo peach (durazno criollo). The cream usually has milk, double cream, fresh cheese and washed nuts. The traditional season for making and eating this dish is August and first half of September, when pomegranates appear in the markets of Central Mexico and the national independence festivities begin.[3] In some areas, the dish is created depending on when the pomegranates are ripe - usually between early October and January.[citation needed]","input":"What are the ingredients of chiles en nogada?"},{"output":"take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) to produce two daughter cells","context":"The cell cycle or cell-division cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) to produce two daughter cells. In bacteria, which lack a cell nucleus, the cell cycle is divided into the B, C, and D periods. The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication. DNA replication occurs during the C period. The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells.[1] In cells with a nucleus, as in eukaryotes, the cell cycle is also divided into three periods: interphase, the mitotic (M) phase, and cytokinesis. During interphase, the cell grows, accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis, preparing it for cell division and duplicating its DNA. During the mitotic phase, the chromosomes separate. During the final stage, cytokinesis, the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells. To ensure the proper division of the cell, there are control mechanisms known as cell cycle checkpoints.\\r\\nThe cell-division cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed. After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cycle. Although the various stages of interphase are not usually morphologically distinguishable, each phase of the cell cycle has a distinct set of specialized biochemical processes that prepare the cell for initiation of cell divisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cell cycle consists of four distinct phases: G1 phase, S phase (synthesis), G2 phase (collectively known as interphase) and M phase (mitosis). M phase is itself composed of two tightly coupled processes: karyokinesis, in which the cell's chromosomes are divided, and cytokinesis, in which the cell's cytoplasm divides forming two daughter cells. Activation of each phase is dependent on the proper progression and completion of the previous one. Cells that have temporarily or reversibly stopped dividing are said to have entered a state of quiescence called G0 phase.\\r\\nAfter cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cycle. Although the various stages of interphase are not usually morphologically distinguishable, each phase of the cell cycle has a distinct set of specialized biochemical processes that prepare the cell for initiation of cell division.\\r\\nG0 is a resting phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing. The cell cycle starts with this phase. The word \\"post-mitotic\\" is sometimes used to refer to both quiescent and senescent cells. Non-proliferative (non-dividing) cells in multicellular eukaryotes generally enter the quiescent G0 state from G1 and may remain quiescent for long periods of time, possibly indefinitely (as is often the case for neurons). This is very common for cells that are fully differentiated. Cellular senescence occurs in response to DNA damage and external stress and usually constitutes an arrest in G1. Some cells enter the G0 phase semi-permanently and are considered post-mitotic, e.g., some liver, kidney, and stomach cells. Many cells do not enter G0 and continue to divide throughout an organism's life, e.g., epithelial cells.\\r\\nCellular senescence is also a state that occurs in response to DNA damage or degradation that would make a cell's progeny nonviable; it is often a biochemical alternative to the self-destruction of such a damaged cell by apoptosis.\\r\\nBefore a cell can enter cell division, it needs to take in nutrients. All of the preparations are done during interphase. Interphase is a series of changes that takes place in a newly formed cell and its nucleus, before it becomes capable of division again. It is also called preparatory phase or intermitosis. Previously it was called resting stage because there is no apparent activity related to cell division.Typically interphase lasts for at least 91% of the total time required for the cell cycle.\\r\\nInterphase proceeds in three stages, G1, S, and G2, followed by the cycle of mitosis and cytokinesis. The cell's nuclear DNA contents are duplicated during S phase but may continue till G2 in case of heterochromatin.\\r\\nThe first phase within interphase, from the end of the previous M phase until the beginning of DNA synthesis, is called G1 (G indicating gap). It is also called the growth phase. During this phase, the biosynthetic activities of the cell, which are considerably slowed down during M phase, resume at a high rate. The duration of G1 is highly variable, even among different cells of the same species.[3] In this phase, the cell increases its supply of proteins, increases the number of organelles (such as mitochondria, ribosomes), and grows in size. In G1 phase, a cell has three options. (1) To continue cell cycle and enter S phase (2) Stop cell cycle and enter G0 phase for undergoing differentiation. (3) Get arrested in G1 phase hence it may enter G0 phase or re-enter cell cycle. The deciding factor is availability of nitrogens and storage of energy rich compounds at the deciding point called check point. This check point is called G1 cyclin or CG1. It causes transition of G1 to S phase. Once the check point of G1 phase is crossed, cell cycle will go uninterrupted till it is completed.\\r\\nThe ensuing S phase starts when DNA synthesis commences; when it is complete, all of the chromosomes have been replicated, i.e., each chromosome has two (sister) chromatids. Thus, during this phase, the amount of DNA in the cell has effectively doubled, though the ploidy of the cell remains the same. Rates of RNA transcription and protein synthesis are very low during this phase. An exception to this is histone production, most of which occurs during the S phase.[4][5][6]\\r\\nG2 phase occurs after DNA replication and is a period of protein synthesis and rapid cell growth to prepare the cell for mitosis. During this phase microtubules begin to reorganize to form a spindle.\\r\\nThe relatively brief M phase consists of nuclear division (karyokinesis). It is a relatively short period of the cell cycle. M phase is complex and highly regulated. The sequence of events is divided into phases, corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next. These phases are sequentially known as:\\r\\nMitosis is the process by which a eukaryotic cell separates the chromosomes in its cell nucleus into two identical sets in two nuclei.[7] During the process of mitosis the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell.[8]\\r\\nMitosis occurs exclusively in eukaryotic cells, but occurs in different ways in different species. For example, animals undergo an \\"open\\" mitosis, where the nuclear envelope breaks down before the chromosomes separate, while fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) undergo a \\"closed\\" mitosis, where chromosomes divide within an intact cell nucleus.[9] Prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus, divide by a process called binary fission.\\r\\nMitosis is immediately followed by cytokinesis, which divides the nuclei, cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the division of the mother cell into two daughter cells, genetically identical to each other and to their parent cell. This accounts for approximately 10% of the cell cycle.\\r\\nBecause cytokinesis usually occurs in conjunction with mitosis, \\"mitosis\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"M phase\\". However, there are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei in a process called endoreplication. This occurs most notably among the fungi and slime moulds, but is found in various groups. Even in animals, cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of fruit fly embryonic development.[10] Errors in mitosis can either kill a cell through apoptosis or cause mutations that may lead to cancer.\\r\\nThe process of mitosis is complex and highly regulated. The sequence of events is divided into phases, corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next. These stages are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During the process of mitosis the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell. The cell then divides in cytokinesis, to produce two identical daughter cells.[8]\\r\\nRegulation of the cell cycle involves processes crucial to the survival of a cell, including the detection and repair of genetic damage as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division. The molecular events that control the cell cycle are ordered and directional; that is, each process occurs in a sequential fashion and it is impossible to \\"reverse\\" the cycle.\\r\\nTwo key classes of regulatory molecules, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), determine a cell's progress through the cell cycle.[11] Leland H. Hartwell, R. Timothy Hunt, and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these central molecules.[12] Many of the genes encoding cyclins and CDKs are conserved among all eukaryotes, but in general more complex organisms have more elaborate cell cycle control systems that incorporate more individual components. Many of the relevant genes were first identified by studying yeast, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae;[13] genetic nomenclature in yeast dubs many of these genes cdc (for \\"cell division cycle\\") followed by an identifying number, e.g. cdc25 or cdc20.\\r\\nCyclins form the regulatory subunits and CDKs the catalytic subunits of an activated heterodimer; cyclins have no catalytic activity and CDKs are inactive in the absence of a partner cyclin. When activated by a bound cyclin, CDKs perform a common biochemical reaction called phosphorylation that activates or inactivates target proteins to orchestrate coordinated entry into the next phase of the cell cycle. Different cyclin-CDK combinations determine the downstream proteins targeted. CDKs are constitutively expressed in cells whereas cyclins are synthesised at specific stages of the cell cycle, in response to various molecular signals.[14]\\r\\nUpon receiving a pro-mitotic extracellular signal, G1 cyclin-CDK complexes become active to prepare the cell for S phase, promoting the expression of transcription factors that in turn promote the expression of S cyclins and of enzymes required for DNA replication. The G1 cyclin-CDK complexes also promote the degradation of molecules that function as S phase inhibitors by targeting them for ubiquitination. Once a protein has been ubiquitinated, it is targeted for proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. However, results from a recent study of E2F transcriptional dynamics at the single-cell level argue that the role of G1 cyclin-CDK activities, in particular cyclin D-CDK4/6, is to tune the timing rather than the commitment of cell cycle entry.[15]\\r\\nActive S cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate proteins that make up the pre-replication complexes assembled during G1 phase on DNA replication origins. The phosphorylation serves two purposes: to activate each already-assembled pre-replication complex, and to prevent new complexes from forming. This ensures that every portion of the cell's genome will be replicated once and only once. The reason for prevention of gaps in replication is fairly clear, because daughter cells that are missing all or part of crucial genes will die. However, for reasons related to gene copy number effects, possession of extra copies of certain genes is also deleterious to the daughter cells.\\r\\nMitotic cyclin-CDK complexes, which are synthesized but inactivated during S and G2 phases, promote the initiation of mitosis by stimulating downstream proteins involved in chromosome condensation and mitotic spindle assembly. A critical complex activated during this process is a ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which promotes degradation of structural proteins associated with the chromosomal kinetochore. APC also targets the mitotic cyclins for degradation, ensuring that telophase and cytokinesis can proceed.[16]\\r\\nCyclin D is the first cyclin produced in the cell cycle, in response to extracellular signals (e.g. growth factors). Cyclin D binds to existing CDK4, forming the active cyclin D-CDK4 complex. Cyclin D-CDK4 complex in turn phosphorylates the retinoblastoma susceptibility protein (Rb). The hyperphosphorylated Rb dissociates from the E2F/DP1/Rb complex (which was bound to the E2F responsive genes, effectively \\"blocking\\" them from transcription), activating E2F. Activation of E2F results in transcription of various genes like cyclin E, cyclin A, DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase, etc. Cyclin E thus produced binds to CDK2, forming the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, which pushes the cell from G1 to S phase (G1/S, which initiates the G2/M transition).[17] Cyclin B-cdk1 complex activation causes breakdown of nuclear envelope and initiation of prophase, and subsequently, its deactivation causes the cell to exit mitosis.[14] A quantitative study of E2F transcriptional dynamics at the single-cell level by using engineered fluorescent reporter cells provided a quantitative framework for understanding the control logic of cell cycle entry, challenging the canonical textbook model. Genes that regulate the amplitude of E2F accumulation, such as Myc, determine the commitment in cell cycle and S phase entry. G1 cyclin-CDK activities are not the driver of cell cycle entry. Instead, they primarily tune the timing of E2F increase, thereby modulating the pace of cell cycle progression.[15]\\r\\nTwo families of genes, the cip/kip (CDK interacting protein/Kinase inhibitory protein) family and the INK4a/ARF (Inhibitor of Kinase 4/Alternative Reading Frame) family, prevent the progression of the cell cycle. Because these genes are instrumental in prevention of tumor formation, they are known as tumor suppressors.\\r\\nThe cip/kip family includes the genes p21, p27 and p57. They halt cell cycle in G1 phase, by binding to, and inactivating, cyclin-CDK complexes. p21 is activated by p53 (which, in turn, is triggered by DNA damage e.g. due to radiation). p27 is activated by Transforming Growth Factor of  (TGF ), a growth inhibitor.\\r\\nThe INK4a/ARF family includes p16INK4a, which binds to CDK4 and arrests the cell cycle in G1 phase, and p14ARF which prevents p53 degradation.\\r\\nSynthetic inhibitors of Cdc25 could also be useful for the arrest of cell cycle and therefore be useful as antineoplastic and anticancer agents.[18]\\r\\nCurrent evidence suggests that a semi-autonomous transcriptional network acts in concert with the CDK-cyclin machinery to regulate the cell cycle. Several gene expression studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified 800ÿ1200 genes that change expression over the course of the cell cycle.[13][19][20] They are transcribed at high levels at specific points in the cell cycle, and remain at lower levels throughout the rest of the cycle. While the set of identified genes differs between studies due to the computational methods and criteria used to identify them, each study indicates that a large portion of yeast genes are temporally regulated.[21]\\r\\nMany periodically expressed genes are driven by transcription factors that are also periodically expressed. One screen of single-gene knockouts identified 48 transcription factors (about 20% of all non-essential transcription factors) that show cell cycle progression defects.[22] Genome-wide studies using high throughput technologies have identified the transcription factors that bind to the promoters of yeast genes, and correlating these findings with temporal expression patterns have allowed the identification of transcription factors that drive phase-specific gene expression.[19][23] The expression profiles of these transcription factors are driven by the transcription factors that peak in the prior phase, and computational models have shown that a CDK-autonomous network of these transcription factors is sufficient to produce steady-state oscillations in gene expression).[20][24]\\r\\nExperimental evidence also suggests that gene expression can oscillate with the period seen in dividing wild-type cells independently of the CDK machinery. Orlando et al. used microarrays to measure the expression of a set of 1,271 genes that they identified as periodic in both wild type cells and cells lacking all S-phase and mitotic cyclins (clb1,2,3,4,5,6). Of the 1,271 genes assayed, 882 continued to be expressed in the cyclin-deficient cells at the same time as in the wild type cells, despite the fact that the cyclin-deficient cells arrest at the border between G1 and S phase. However, 833 of the genes assayed changed behavior between the wild type and mutant cells, indicating that these genes are likely directly or indirectly regulated by the CDK-cyclin machinery. Some genes that continued to be expressed on time in the mutant cells were also expressed at different levels in the mutant and wild type cells. These findings suggest that while the transcriptional network may oscillate independently of the CDK-cyclin oscillator, they are coupled in a manner that requires both to ensure the proper timing of cell cycle events.[20] Other work indicates that phosphorylation, a post-translational modification, of cell cycle transcription factors by Cdk1 may alter the localization or activity of the transcription factors in order to tightly control timing of target genes.[22][25][26]\\r\\nWhile oscillatory transcription plays a key role in the progression of the yeast cell cycle, the CDK-cyclin machinery operates independently in the early embryonic cell cycle. Before the midblastula transition, zygotic transcription does not occur and all needed proteins, such as the B-type cyclins, are translated from maternally loaded mRNA.[27]\\r\\nAnalyses of synchronized cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under conditions that prevent DNA replication initiation without delaying cell cycle progression showed that origin licensing decreases the expression of genes with origins near their 3' ends, revealing that downstream origins can regulate the expression of upstream genes.[28] This confirms previous predictions from mathematical modeling of a global causal coordination between DNA replication origin activity and mRNA expression,[29][30][31] and shows that mathematical modeling of DNA microarray data can be used to correctly predict previously unknown biological modes of regulation.\\r\\nCell cycle checkpoints are used by the cell to monitor and regulate the progress of the cell cycle.[32] Checkpoints prevent cell cycle progression at specific points, allowing verification of necessary phase processes and repair of DNA damage. The cell cannot proceed to the next phase until checkpoint requirements have been met. Checkpoints typically consist of a network of regulatory proteins that monitor and dictate the progression of the cell through the different stages of the cell cycle.\\r\\nThere are several checkpoints to ensure that damaged or incomplete DNA is not passed on to daughter cells. Three main checkpoints exist: the G1/S checkpoint, the G2/M checkpoint and the metaphase (mitotic) checkpoint.\\r\\nG1/S transition is a rate-limiting step in the cell cycle and is also known as restriction point.[14] This is where the cell checks whether it has enough raw materials to fully replicate its DNA (nucleotide bases, DNA synthase, chromatin, etc.). An unhealthy or malnourished cell will get stuck at this checkpoint.\\r\\nThe G2/M checkpoint is where the cell ensures that it has enough cytoplasm and phospholipids for two daughter cells. But sometimes more importantly, it checks to see if it is the right time to replicate. There are some situations where many cells need to all replicate simultaneously (for example, a growing embryo should have a symmetric cell distribution until it reaches the mid-blastula transition). This is done by controlling the G2/M checkpoint.\\r\\nThe metaphase checkpoint is a fairly minor checkpoint, in that once a cell is in metaphase, it has committed to undergoing mitosis. However that's not to say it isn't important. In this checkpoint, the cell checks to ensure that the spindle has formed and that all of the chromosomes are aligned at the spindle equator before anaphase begins.[33]\\r\\nWhile these are the three \\"main\\" checkpoints, not all cells have to pass through each of these checkpoints in this order to replicate. Many types of cancer are caused by mutations that allow the cells to speed through the various checkpoints or even skip them altogether. Going from S to M to S phase almost consecutively. Because these cells have lost their checkpoints, any DNA mutations that may have occurred are disregarded and passed on to the daughter cells. This is one reason why cancer cells have a tendency to exponentially accrue mutations. Aside from cancer cells, many fully differentiated cell types no longer replicate so they leave the cell cycle and stay in G0 until their death. Thus removing the need for cellular checkpoints. An alternative model of the cell cycle response to DNA damage has also been proposed, known as the postreplication checkpoint.\\r\\nCheckpoint regulation plays an important role in an organism's development. In sexual reproduction, when egg fertilization occurs, when the sperm binds to the egg, it releases signalling factors that notify the egg that it has been fertilized. Among other things, this induces the now fertilized oocyte to return from its previously dormant, G0, state back into the cell cycle and on to mitotic replication and division.\\r\\np53 plays an important role in triggering the control mechanisms at both G1/S and G2/M checkpoints. In addition to p53, checkpoint regulators are being heavily researched for their roles in cancer growth and proliferation.\\r\\nPioneering work by Atsushi Miyawaki and coworkers developed the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI), which enables fluorescence imaging of the cell cycle. Originally, a green fluorescent protein, mAG, was fused to hGem(1/110) and an orange fluorescent protein (mKO2) was fused to hCdt1(30/120). Note, these fusions are fragments that contain a nuclear localization signal and ubiquitination sites for degradation, but are not functional proteins. The green fluorescent protein is made during the S, G2, or M phase and degraded during the G0 or G1 phase, while the orange fluorescent protein is made during the G0 or G1 phase and destroyed during the S, G2, or M phase.[34] A far-red and near-infrared FUCCI was developed using a cyanobacteria-derived fluorescent protein (smURFP) and a bacteriophytochrome-derived fluorescent protein (movie found at this link).[35]\\r\\nA disregulation of the cell cycle components may lead to tumor formation.[36] As mentioned above, when some genes like the cell cycle inhibitors, RB, p53 etc. mutate, they may cause the cell to multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Although the duration of cell cycle in tumor cells is equal to or longer than that of normal cell cycle, the proportion of cells that are in active cell division (versus quiescent cells in G0 phase) in tumors is much higher than that in normal tissue[citation needed]. Thus there is a net increase in cell number as the number of cells that die by apoptosis or senescence remains the same.\\r\\nThe cells which are actively undergoing cell cycle are targeted in cancer therapy as the DNA is relatively exposed during cell division and hence susceptible to damage by drugs or radiation. This fact is made use of in cancer treatment; by a process known as debulking, a significant mass of the tumor is removed which pushes a significant number of the remaining tumor cells from G0 to G1 phase (due to increased availability of nutrients, oxygen, growth factors etc.). Radiation or chemotherapy following the debulking procedure kills these cells which have newly entered the cell cycle.[14]\\r\\nThe fastest cycling mammalian cells in culture, crypt cells in the intestinal epithelium, have a cycle time as short as 9 to 10 hours. Stem cells in resting mouse skin may have a cycle time of more than 200 hours. Most of this difference is due to the varying length of G1, the most variable phase of the cycle. M and S do not vary much.\\r\\nIn general, cells are most radiosensitive in late M and G2 phases and most resistant in late S phase.\\r\\nFor cells with a longer cell cycle time and a significantly long G1 phase, there is a second peak of resistance late in G1.\\r\\nThe pattern of resistance and sensitivity correlates with the level of sulfhydryl compounds in the cell. Sulfhydryls are natural substances that protect cells from radiation damage and tend to be at their highest levels in S and at their lowest near mitosis.","input":"When do cells go through the cell cycle?"},{"output":"Nabi Tajima of Japan","context":"This is a list of the 100 oldest people who have been verified to be alive within the last one year and whose death has not been reported by a reliable source.

At its zenith from approximately 319 to 550 CE it covered much of the Indian subcontinent.[1] This period is called the Golden Age of India.[2][note 1] The ruling dynasty of the empire was founded by Sri Gupta; the most notable rulers of the dynasty were Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, and Chandragupta II. The 5th-century CE Sanskrit poet Kalidasa credits the Guptas with having conquered about twenty-one kingdoms, both in and outside India, including the kingdoms of Parasikas, the Hunas, the Kambojas, tribes located in the west and east Oxus valleys, the Kinnaras, Kiratas, and others.[4][non-primary source needed]\\r\\nThe high points of this period are the great cultural developments which took place during the reign of Chandragupta II. All literary sources, such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, were canonised during this period.[5] The Gupta period produced scholars such as Kalidasa, Aryabhata, Varahamihira, Vishnu Sharma and Vatsyayana who made great advancements in many academic fields.[6][7] Science and political administration reached new heights during the Gupta era. The period gave rise to achievements in architecture, sculpture, and painting that \\"set standards of form and taste [that] determined the whole subsequent course of art, not only in India but far beyond her borders\\".[8] Strong trade ties also made the region an important cultural center and established the region as a base that would influence nearby kingdoms and regions in Burma, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia.[9][unreliable source?] The Puranas, earlier long poems on a variety of subjects, are also thought to have been committed to written texts around this period.[8]\\r\\nThe empire eventually died out because of many factors such as substantial loss of territory and imperial authority caused by their own erstwhile feudatories, as well as the invasion by the Huna peoples (Kidarites and Alchon Huns) from Central Asia.[10][11] After the collapse of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century, India was again ruled by numerous regional kingdoms. A minor line of the Gupta clan continued to rule Magadha after the disintegration of the empire. These Guptas were ultimately ousted by the Vardhana ruler Harsha, who established his empire in the first half of the 7th century.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to many scholars and historians, the Gupta Dynasty was of Vaishya origin.[12][13] Historian Ram Sharan Sharma asserts that the Vaishya Guptas \\"appeared as a reaction against oppressive rulers\\".[14] A.S. Altekar, a historian and archaeologist, who has written several books on Gupta coinage,[15] also regarded the caste of the Guptas as Vaishya on the basis of the ancient Indian texts on law, which associate the Gupta name suffix with a member of the Vaishya caste. According to historian Michael C. Brannigan, the rise of the Gupta Empire was one of the most prominent violations of the caste system in ancient India.[13]\\r\\nHowever Gupta Empire records and Chinese records provided by the later I-Tsing, furnished the names of the first three rulers of the Gupta Dynasty: Maharaja Sri Gupta, Maharaja Sri Ghatotkacha and Ghatotokacha's son, and Maharajadhiraja Sri Chandragupta, who is considered the first Gupta emperor. Recently, the historian Ashvini Agarwal, on the basis of the matrimonial alliances of the Guptas with the Vakataka, assumed that they belong to the Brahmin caste.[16] Another modern historian, S. Chattopaddhyaya, has put forth a different theory about the ancestry of the Guptas. According to him, in the Panchobh Copper Plate, some kings bearing the title Guptas and related to the imperial Gupta Dynasty, claimed themselves as Vaishyas. Nepalese historian D. R. Regmi says that the imperial Guptas were descendants of Abhira Guptas who had ruled the Kathmandu valley in present-day Nepal.[17][18]\\r\\nThere is controversy among scholars about the original homeland of the Guptas. Jayaswal has pointed out that the Guptas were originally inhabitants of Prayaga (Allahabad), Uttar Pradesh, in north India, as the vassal of the Nagas or Bhaarshivas. Thereafter they rose in prominence. Another scholar, Gayal supported the theory of Jayaswal, suggesting that the original home of the Guptas was Antarvedi and embracing the regions of Oudh and Prayag. These historians have derived their theory from several Gupta Dynasty coins found in those regions, and this study of numismatic evidence led to the theory that the Guptas were the original inhabitants of that region of northeastern India. However, another historian of this time in Indian history, D. K. Ganguly, has offered a different view about the original Gupta homeland. According to him the Guptas' homeland is further south, the Murshidabad region of Bengal, and not Magadha in Bihar. He based his theory on the statement of the Chinese Buddhist monk, Yijing (I-Tsing), who visited India during 675 and 695 CE. J. F. Fleet and other historians, however, criticize Ganguly's theory because Sri Gupta ruled during the end of the 3rd century, but Yijing placed him at the end of the 2nd century. Hence the theory of historians, who have provided their views based on the accounts of Yijing, are considered less valid than theories based on other sources such as coinage.\\r\\nFrom these theories, several conflicting opinions about the original homeland and the Empire of the Guptas are available. According to John Allan and a few other scholars, the Guptas were initially concentrated in the region of Magadha and from there they extended their sway to Bengal. According to other groups, the original homeland of the Guptas was Varendri or the Varendra Bhumi in Bengal, wherefrom they extended their Empire to Magadha. Whatever the theory is, the rule of the Guptas initiated the Golden Age in history of ancient India and with passage of time they became the sole authority of entire Northern India.\\r\\nBengali historians like HC Raychoudhuri the Guptas originated from the Varendri region which is now part of Rangpur and Rajshahi Division of modern-day Bangladesh. D.C. Ganguly, on the other hand, considers the surrounding region of Murshidabad as the original home of the Guptas.[19]\\r\\nThe most likely time for the reign of Sri Gupta is c. 240ÿ280.[20] The Murundas, who were feudal lords of Kushans, provided or granted land to Sri Gupta. He can be considered the first person of Gupta's empire, but not the founder of the empire. His son and successor Ghatotkacha ruled presumably from c. 280ÿ319. He challenged other feudal lords and conquered their lands. In contrast to his successor, Chandragupta I, who is mentioned as Maharajadhiraja, he and his son Ghatotkacha are referred to in inscriptions as Maharaja.[21] At the beginning of the 4th century, the Guptas established and ruled a few small Hindu kingdoms in Magadha and around modern-day Bihar.\\r\\nYijing[22] also mentioned Sri Gupta in his writings. He was succeeded by his son Ghatotkacha.\\r\\nGhatotkacha reigned from about 280 CE to 319 CE, and had a son named Chandragupta (reigned c. 320ÿ335 CE) His son is not to be confused with Chandragupta Maurya (322ÿ298 BCE), founder of the Mauryan Empire. In a breakthrough deal, Chandragupta was married to Kumaradevi, a Lichchhavi princessthe main power in Magadha. With a dowry of the kingdom of Magadha (capital Pataliputra) and an alliance with the Licchavis of Nepal, Chandragupta set about expanding his power, conquering much of Magadha, Prayaga, and Saketa. Unlike most other classical empires, Gupta India failed to build fortresses to shore up these vulnerable regions, which led in part to letting them fall out of Guptan hands.[23] He established a realm stretching from the Ganges River to Prayaga (modern-day Allahabad) by 321. He assumed the imperial title of Maharajadhiraja. He expanded his empire through marriage alliances.\\r\\nSamudragupta, Parakramanka succeeded his father in 335, and ruled for about 45?years, until his death in 380. He took the kingdoms of Ahichchhatra and Padmavati early in his reign. He then attacked the Malwas, the Yaudheyas, the Arjunayanas, the Maduras and the Abhiras, all of which were tribes in the area. By his death in 380, he had incorporated over twenty kingdoms into his realm and his rule extended from the Himalayas to the river Narmada and from the Brahmaputra to the Yamuna. He gave himself the titles King of Kings and World Monarch. Historian Vincent Smith described him as the \\"Indian Napoleon\\".[24] He performed Ashwamedha Yajna in which a horse with an army is sent to all the nearby territories of friends and foes. These territorial kings on arrival either accept the king's alliance, who is performing this Yajna, or fight if they do not. The stone replica of the horse, then prepared, is in the Lucknow Museum. The Samudragupta Prashasti inscribed on the Ashokan Pillar, now in Akbars Fort at Allahabad, is an authentic record of his exploits and his sway over most of the continent.\\r\\nSamudragupta was not only a talented military leader but also a great patron of art and literature. He conquered what is now Kashmir and Afghanistan, enlarging the empire.[25] The critical scholars present in his court were Harishena, Vasubandhu, and Asanga. He was a poet and musician himself. He was a firm believer in Hinduism and is known to have worshipped Lord Vishnu. He was considerate of other religions and allowed Sri Lanka's Buddhist king Sirimeghvanna to build a monastery at Bodh Gaya. That monastery was called by Xuanzang as the Mahabodhi Sangharama.[26][unreliable source?] He provided a gold railing around the Bodhi Tree.\\r\\nAlthough, the narrative of the Devichandragupta is not supported by any contemporary epigraphical evidence, the historicity of Rama Gupta is proved by his Durjanpur inscriptions on three Jaina images, where he is mentioned as the Maharajadhiraja. A large number of his copper coins also have been found from the Eran-Vidisha region and classified in five distinct types, which include the Garuda,[27] Garudadhvaja, lion and border legend types. The Brahmi legends on these coins are written in the early Gupta style.[28] In the opinion of art historian Dr. R. A. Agarawala, D. Litt., Rama Gupta may be the eldest son of Samudragupta. He became king because of being the eldest. It is possible that he was dethroned because of being considered unfit to rule, and his younger brother Chandragupta II took over.\\r\\nAccording to the Gupta records, amongst his sons, Samudragupta nominated prince Chandragupta II, born of queen Dattadevi, as his successor. Chandragupta II, Vikramaditya (the Sun of Power), ruled from 375 until 415. He married a Kadamba princess of Kuntala and of Naga lineage (Ngakulotpannn), Kuberanaga. His daughter Prabhavatigupta from this Naga queen was married to Rudrasena II, the Vakataka ruler of Deccan.[29] His son Kumaragupta I was married to a Kadamba princess of the Karnataka region. Chandragupta II expanded his realm westwards, defeating the Saka Western Kshatrapas of Malwa, Gujarat and Saurashtra in a campaign lasting until 409. His main opponent Rudrasimha III was defeated by 395, and he crushed the Bengal chiefdoms. This extended his control from coast to coast, established a second capital at Ujjain and was the high point of the empire.\\r\\nDespite the creation of the empire through war, the reign is remembered for its very influential style of Hindu art, literature, culture and science, especially during the reign of Chandragupta II. Some excellent works of Hindu art such as the panels at the Dashavatara Temple in Deogarh serve to illustrate the magnificence of Gupta art. Above all it was the synthesis of elements that gave Gupta art its distinctive flavour. During this period, the Guptas were supportive of thriving Buddhist and Jain cultures as well, and for this reason there is also a long history of non-Hindu Gupta period art. In particular, Gupta period Buddhist art was to be influential in most of East and Southeast Asia. Many advances were recorded by the Chinese scholar and traveller Faxian (Fa-hien) in his diary and published afterwards.\\r\\nThe court of Chandragupta was made even more illustrious by the fact that it was graced by the Navaratna (Nine Jewels), a group of nine who excelled in the literary arts. Amongst these men was the immortal Klidsa whose works dwarfed the works of many other literary geniuses, not only in his own age but in the years to come. Kalidasa was mainly known for his subtle exploitation of the shringara (romantic) element in his verse.\\r\\nThe 4th century Sanskrit poet Kalidasa credits Chandragupta Vikramaditya with conquering about twenty one kingdoms, both in and outside India. After finishing his campaign in East and West India, Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) proceeded northwards, subjugated the Parasikas, then the Hunas and the Kambojas tribes located in the west and east Oxus valleys respectively. Thereafter, the king proceeded into the Himalaya mountains to reduce the mountain tribes of the Kinnaras, Kiratas, as well as India proper.[4][non-primary source needed]\\r\\nThe Brihatkathamanjari of the Kashmiri writer Kshemendra states, King Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) had \\"unburdened the sacred earth of the Barbarians like the Sakas, Mlecchas, Kambojas, Yavanas, Tusharas, Parasikas, Hunas, and others, by annihilating these sinful Mlecchas completely\\".[30][non-primary source needed][31][32][unreliable source?]\\r\\nFaxian (or Fa Hsien etc.), a Chinese Buddhist, was one of the pilgrims who visited India during the reign of the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II. He started his journey from China in 399 and reached India in 405. During his stay in India up to 411, he went on a pilgrimage to Mathura, Kannauj, Kapilavastu, Kushinagar, Vaishali, Pataliputra, Kashi, and Rajagriha, and made careful observations about the empire's conditions. Faxian was pleased with the mildness of administration. The Penal Code was mild and offenses were punished by fines only. From his accounts, the Gupta Empire was a prosperous period. And until the Rome-China trade axis was broken with the fall of the Han dynasty, the Guptas' did indeed prosper. His writings form one of the most important sources for the history of this period.\\r\\nChandragupta II was succeeded by his second son Kumaragupta I, born of Mahadevi Dhruvasvamini. Kumaragupta I assumed the title, Mahendraditya.[35] He ruled until 455. Towards the end of his reign a tribe in the Narmada valley, the Pushyamitras, rose in power to threaten the empire. The Kidarites as well probably confronted the Gupta Empire towards the end of the rule of Kumaragupta I, as his son Skandagupta mentions in the Bhitari pillar inscription his efforts at reshaping a country in disarray, through reorganization and military victories over the Pushyamitras and the Hunas.[36]\\r\\nHe was the founder of Nalanda University which on July 15, 2016 was declared as a UNESCO world heritage site.[37]\\r\\nSkandagupta, son and successor of Kumaragupta I is generally considered to be the last of the great Gupta rulers. He assumed the titles of Vikramaditya and Kramaditya.[38] He defeated the Pushyamitra threat, but then was faced with invading Kidarites (sometimes described as the Hephthalites or \\"White Huns\\", known in India as the Sweta Huna), from the northwest.\\r\\nHe repelled a Huna attack around 455 CE, but the expense of the wars drained the empire's resources and contributed to its decline. The Bhitari Pillar inscription of Skandagupta, the successor of Chandragupta, recalls the near-annihilation of the Gupta Empire following the attacks of the Kidarites.[39] The Kidarites seem to have retained the western part of the Gupta Empire.[39]\\r\\nSkandagupta died in 467 and was succeeded by his agnate brother Purugupta.[40]\\r\\nFollowing Skandagupta's death, the empire was clearly in decline.[41] He was followed by Purugupta (467ÿ473), Kumaragupta II (473ÿ476), Budhagupta (476ÿ495), Narasimhagupta (495?), Kumaragupta III (530540), Vishnugupta (540550), two lesser known kings namely, Vainyagupta and Bhanugupta.\\r\\nIn the 480's the Alchon Huns under Toramana and Mihirakula broke through the Gupta defenses in the northwest, and much of the empire in the northwest was overrun by the Huns by 500. The empire disintegrated under the attacks of Toramana and his successor Mihirakula. It appears from inscriptions that the Guptas, although their power was much diminished, continued to resist the Huns. The Hun invader Toramana was defeated by Bhanugupta in 510.[42][43] The Huns were defeated and driven out of India in 528 by king Yashodharman from Malwa, and possibly Gupta emperor Narasimhagupta.[44]\\r\\nThese invasions, although only spanning a few decades, had long term effects on India, and in a sense brought an end to Classical Indian civilization.[45] Soon after the invasions, the Gupta Empire, already weakened by these invasions and the rise of local rulers such as Yashodharman, ended as well.[46] Following the invasions, northern India was left in disarray, with numerous smaller Indian powers emerging after the crumbling of the Guptas.[47] The Huna invasions are said to have seriously damaged India's trade with Europe and Central Asia.[45] In particular, Indo-Roman trade relations, which the Gupta Empire had greatly benefited from. The Guptas had been exporting numerous luxury products such as silk, leather goods, fur, iron products, ivory, pearl, and pepper from centers such as Nasik, Paithan, Pataliputra, and Benares. The Huna invasion probably disrupted these trade relations and the tax revenues that came with them.[48]\\r\\nFurthermore, Indian urban culture was left in decline, and Buddhism, gravely weakened by the destruction of monasteries and the killing of monks, started to collapse.[45] Great centers of learning were destroyed, such as the city of Taxila, bringing cultural regression.[45] During their rule of 60 years, the Alchons are said to have altered the hierarchy of ruling families and the Indian cast system. For example, the Hunas are often said to have become the precursors of the Rajputs.[45]\\r\\nThe succession of the 6th-century Guptas is not entirely clear, but the tail end recognized ruler of the dynasty's main line was king Vishnugupta, reigning from 540 to 550. In addition to the Hun invasion, the factors, which contribute to the decline of the empire include competition from the Vakatakas and the rise of Yashodharman in Malwa.[49]\\r\\nThe last known inscription by a Gupta emperor is from the reign of Vishnugupta (the Damodarpur copper-plate inscription),[50] in which he makes a land grant in the area of Kotivarsha (Bangarh in West Bengal) in 542/543 CE.[51] This follows the occupation of most of northern and central India by the Aulikara ruler Yashodharman circa 532 CE.[51]\\r\\nThe Imperial Guptas couldn't have achieved their successes through force of arms without an efficient martial system. Historically, the best accounts of this not only come from Indian sources themselves but from Chinese and Western observers. However, a contemporary Indian document, regarded as a military classic of the time, the Siva-Dhanur-veda, offers some insight into the military system of the Guptas.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Guptas seem to have relied heavily on infantry archers, and the bow was one of the dominant weapons of their army. The Indian version of the longbow was composed of metal, or more typically bamboo, and fired a long bamboo cane arrow with a metal head.[citation needed] Unlike the composite bows of Western and Central Asian foes, bows of this design would be less prone to warping in the damp and moist conditions often prevalent to the region. The Indian longbow was reputedly a powerful weapon capable of great range and penetration and provided an effective counter to invading horse archers. Iron shafts were used against armored elephants and fire arrows were not part of the bowmen's arsenal, contrary to popular belief. India historically has had a prominent reputation for its steel weapons. One of these was the steel bow. Because of its high tensility, the steel bow was capable of long range and penetration of exceptionally thick armor. These were less common weapons than the bamboo design and found in the hands of noblemen rather than in the ranks. Archers were frequently protected by infantry equipped with shields, javelins, and longswords. The Guptas also had knowledge of siegecraft, catapults, and other sophisticated war machines.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Guptas apparently showed little predilection for using horse archers, despite the fact these warriors were a primary component in the ranks of their Scythian, Parthian, and Hepthalite (Huna) enemies. However, the Gupta armies were probably better disciplined. Able commanders such as Samudragupta and Chandragupta II would have likely understood the need for combined armed tactics and proper logistical organization. Gupta military success likely stemmed from the concerted use of elephants, armored cavalry, steel bow and foot archers in tandem against both Hindu kingdoms and foreign armies invading from the Northwest. The Guptas also maintained a navy, allowing them to control regional waters.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe collapse of the Gupta Empire in the face of the Huna onslaught was due not directly to the inherent defects of the Gupta army, which after all had initially defeated these people under Skandagupta. More likely, internal dissolution sapped the ability of the Guptas to resist foreign invasion, as was simultaneously occurring in Western Europe and China.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring the reign of Chandragupta II, Gupta Empire maintained a large army consisting of 500,000 infantry, 50,000 cavalry, 20,000 charioteers and 10,000 elephants[citation needed] along with a powerful navy with more than 1200 ships[citation needed]. Chandragupta II controlled the whole of the Indian subcontinent;[1] the Gupta empire was the most powerful empire in the world during his reign, at a time when the Roman Empire in the West was in decline.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Guptas were traditionally a Hindu dynasty.[52] They were orthodox Hindus, but did not force their beliefs on the rest of the population, as Buddhism and Jainism also were encouraged.[53] Sanchi remained an important center of Buddhism.[53] Kumaragupta I (c.?414 ÿ c.?455 CE) is said to have founded Nalanda.[53]\\r\\nSome later rulers however seem to have especially favoured Buddhism. Narasimhagupta Baladitya (c. 495-?), according to contemporary writer Paramartha, was brought up under the influence of the Mahayanist philosopher, Vasubandhu.[52] He built a sangharama at Nalanda and also a 300?ft (91?m) high vihara with a Buddha statue within which, according to Xuanzang, resembled the \\"great Vihara built under the Bodhi tree\\". According to the Manjushrimulakalpa (c. 800 CE), king Narasimhsagupta became a Buddhist monk, and left the world through meditation (Dhyana).[52] The Chinese monk Xuanzang also noted that Narasimhagupta Baladitya's son, Vajra, who commissioned a sangharama as well, \\"possessed a heart firm in faith\\".[54]:45[55]:330\\r\\nA study of the epigraphical records of the Gupta empire shows that there was a hierarchy of administrative divisions from top to bottom. The empire was called by various names such as Rajya, Rashtra, Desha, Mandala, Prithvi and Avani. It was divided into 26 provinces, which were styled as Bhukti, Pradesha and Bhoga. Provinces were also divided into Vishayas and put under the control of the Vishayapatis. A Vishayapati administered the Vishaya with the help of the Adhikarana (council of representatives), which comprised four representatives: Nagarasreshesthi, Sarthavaha, Prathamakulike and Prathama Kayastha. A part of the Vishaya was called Vithi.[56] There were also trade links of Gupta business with the Roman empire.\\r\\nScholars of this period include Varahamihira and Aryabhata, who is believed to be the first to come up with the concept of zero, postulated the theory that the Earth moves round the Sun, and studied solar and lunar eclipses. Kalidasa, who was a great playwright, who wrote plays such as Shakuntala, and marked the highest point of Sanskrit literature is also said to have belonged to this period. The Sushruta Samhita, which is a Sanskrit redaction text on all of the major concepts of ayurvedic medicine with innovative chapters on surgery, dates to the Gupta period.\\r\\nChess is said to have originated in this period,[57] where its early form in the 6th century was known as catura?ga, which translates as \\"four divisions [of the military]\\" ÿ infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry ÿ represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. Doctors also invented several medical instruments, and even performed operations. The Indian numerals which were the first positional base 10 numeral systems in the world originated from Gupta India. The ancient Gupta text Kama Sutra by the Indian scholar Vatsyayana is widely considered to be the standard work on human sexual behavior in Sanskrit literature.\\r\\nAryabhata, a noted mathematician-astronomer of the Gupta period proposed that the earth is round and rotates about its own axis. He also discovered that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight. Instead of the prevailing cosmogony in which eclipses were caused by pseudo-planetary nodes Rahu and Ketu, he explained eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth.[58]\\r\\nThe Gupta period is generally regarded as a classic peak of North Indian art for all the major religious groups. Although painting was evidently widespread, the surviving works are almost all religious sculpture. The period saw the emergence of the iconic carved stone deity in Hindu art, as well as the Buddha figure and Jain tirthankara figures, the latter often on a very large scale. The two great centres of sculpture were Mathura and Gandhara, the latter the centre of Greco-Buddhist art. Both exported sculpture to other parts of northern India. Unlike the preceding Kushan Empire there was no artistic depiction of the monarchs, even in the very fine Guptan coinage,[59] with the exception of some coins of the Western Satraps, or influenced by them.\\r\\nThe most famous remaining monuments in a broadly Gupta style, the caves at Ajanta, Elephanta, and Ellora (respectively Buddhist, Hindu, and mixed including Jain) were in fact produced under later dynasties, but primarily reflect the monumentality and balance of Guptan style. Ajanta contains by far the most significant survivals of painting from this and the surrounding periods, showing a mature form which had probably had a long development, mainly in painting palaces.[60] The Hindu Udayagiri Caves actually record connections with the dynasty and its ministers,[61] and the Dashavatara Temple at Deogarh is a major temple, one of the earliest to survive, with important sculpture.[62]\\r\\nVishnu reclining on the serpent Shesha (Ananta), Dashavatara Temple 5th century\\r\\nBuddha from Sarnath, 5ÿ6th century CE\\r\\nThe Colossal trimurti at the Elephanta Caves\\r\\nRock-cut temples at Ellora\\r\\nPainting of Padmapani Cave 1 at Ajanta\\r\\ncultural period\\r\\n(Punjab-Sapta Sindhu)\\r\\n(Kuru-Panchala)\\r\\n(Brahmin ideology)[a]\\r\\nPainted Grey Ware culture\\r\\n(Kshatriya/Shramanic culture)[b]\\r\\nNorthern Black Polished Ware\\r\\nRise of Shramana movements\\r\\nJainism - Buddhism - jؐvika - Yoga\\r\\nEarly Pandyan Kingdom\\r\\nSatavahana dynasty\\r\\nCheras\\r\\n46 other small kingdoms in Ancient Thamizhagam\\r\\n(continued)\\r\\n(300 BC ÿ 200 AD)\\r\\nMaha-Meghavahana Dynasty\\r\\nEarly Pandyan Kingdom\\r\\nSatavahana dynasty\\r\\nCheras\\r\\n46 other small kingdoms in Ancient Thamizhagam\\r\\nIndo-Scythians\\r\\nIndo-Parthians\\r\\nPandyan Kingdom(Under Kalabhras)\\r\\nVarman dynasty\\r\\nPandyan Kingdom(Under Kalabhras)\\r\\nKadamba Dynasty\\r\\nWestern Ganga Dynasty\\r\\nPandyan Kingdom(Under Kalabhras)\\r\\nVishnukundina\\r\\nKabul Shahi\\r\\nKalabhra dynasty\\r\\nPandyan Kingdom(Under Kalabhras)\\r\\nPandyan Kingdom(Revival)\\r\\nPallava\\r\\nKalachuri\\r\\nPandyan Kingdom\\r\\nMedieval Cholas\\r\\nPandyan Kingdom(Under Cholas)\\r\\nChera Perumals of Makkotai\\r\\nKamboja-Pala dynasty\\r\\nMedieval Cholas\\r\\nPandyan Kingdom(Under Cholas)\\r\\nChera Perumals of Makkotai\\r\\nRashtrakuta\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nSources","input":"Who is considered founder of the gupta empire?"},{"output":"the sin of disobedience in consuming from the tree of knowledge of good and evil","context":"Original sin, also called ancestral sin,[1] is the Christian doctrine of humanity's state of sin resulting from the fall of man, stemming from Adam and Eve's rebellion in Eden, namely the sin of disobedience in consuming from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.[2] This condition has been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a \\"sin nature\\", to something as drastic as total depravity or automatic guilt of all humans through collective guilt.[3]\\r\\nThe concept of original sin was first alluded to in the 2nd century by Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon in his controversy with certain dualist Gnostics[citation needed]. Other church fathers such as Augustine also developed the doctrine,[2] seeing it as based on the New Testament teaching of Paul the Apostle (Romans 5:12ÿ21 and 1 Corinthians 15:22) and the Old Testament verse of Psalms 51:5.[4][5][6][7][8] Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose and Ambrosiaster considered that humanity shares in Adam's sin, transmitted by human generation. Augustine's formulation of original sin was popular among Protestant reformers, such as Martin Luther and John Calvin, who equated original sin with concupiscence (or \\"hurtful desire\\"), affirming that it persisted even after baptism and completely destroyed freedom.[2] The Jansenist movement, which the Catholic Church declared to be heretical, also maintained that original sin destroyed freedom of will.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctrine of ancestral fault (? ??϶ϫ progonikon hamartema), i.e. the sins of the forefathers leading to punishment of their descendants, was presented as a tradition of immemorial antiquity in ancient Greek religion by Celsus in his True Doctrine, a polemic attacking Christianity. Celsus is quoted as attributing to \\"a priest of Apollo or of Zeus\\" the saying that \\"the mills of the gods grind slowly, even to children's children, and to those who are born after them\\".[10] The idea of divine justice taking the form of collective punishment is also ubiquitous in the Hebrew Bible.[11]\\r\\nSt Paul's idea of redemption hinged upon the contrast between the sin of Adam and the death and resurrection of Jesus. \\"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned.\\"[12] \\"For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.\\"[13] Up till then the transgression in the Garden of Eden had not been given great significance. As the Jesus scholar, Geza Vermes has said:\\r\\nPaul believed that Adam's transgression in a mysterious way affected the nature of the human race. The primeval sin, a Pauline creation with no biblical or post-biblical Jewish precedent, was irreparable by ordinary human effort.[14]\\r\\nThe formalized Christian doctrine of original sin was first developed in the 2nd century by Irenaeus, the Bishop of Lyon, in his struggle against Gnosticism.[2] Irenaeus contrasted their doctrine with the view that the Fall was a step in the wrong direction by Adam, with whom, Irenaeus believed, his descendants had some solidarity or identity.[15] Irenaeus believed that Adam's sin had grave consequences for humanity, that it is the source of human sinfulness, mortality and enslavement to sin, and that all human beings participate in his sin and share his guilt.[16]\\r\\nThe Greek Fathers emphasized the cosmic dimension of the Fall, namely that since Adam human beings are born into a fallen world, but held fast to belief that man, though fallen, is free.[2] They thus did not teach that human beings are deprived of free will and involved in total depravity, which is one understanding of original sin.[17][18] During this period the doctrines of human depravity and the inherently sinful nature of human flesh were taught by Gnostics, and orthodox Christian writers took great pains to counter them.[19][20] Christian apologists insisted that God's future judgment of humanity implied humanity must have the ability to live righteously.[21][22]\\r\\nHistorian Robin Lane Fox argues that the foundation of the doctrine of original sin as accepted by the Church was ultimately based on a mistranslation of Paul the Apostle's Epistle to the Romans (Romans 5:12ÿ21) by Augustine, in his On the Grace of Christ, and on Original Sin\\".[23]\\r\\nAugustine of Hippo (354ÿ430) taught that Adam's sin[24] is transmitted by concupiscence, or \\"hurtful desire\\",[25][26] resulting in humanity becoming a massa damnata (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will.[2] When Adam sinned, human nature was thenceforth transformed. Adam and Eve, via sexual reproduction, recreated human nature. Their descendants now live in sin, in the form of concupiscence, a term Augustine used in a metaphysical, not a psychological sense.[27] Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not a being but a bad quality, the privation of good or a wound.[28] He admitted that sexual concupiscence (libido) might have been present in the perfect human nature in paradise, and that only later it became disobedient to human will as a result of the first couple's disobedience to God's will in the original sin.[29] In Augustine's view (termed \\"Realism\\"), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned, and therefore all have sinned. Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit. As sinners, humans are utterly depraved in nature, lack the freedom to do good, and cannot respond to the will of God without divine grace. Justo Gonzalez interprets Augustine's teaching that grace is irresistible, results in conversion, and leads to perseverance.[30]\\r\\nAugustine articulated his explanation in reaction to Pelagianism, which insisted that humans have of themselves, without the necessary help of God's grace, the ability to lead a morally good life, and thus denied both the importance of baptism and the teaching that God is the giver of all that is good. Pelagius claimed that the influence of Adam on other humans was merely that of bad example. Augustine held that the effects of Adam's sin are transmitted to his descendants not by example but by the very fact of generation from that ancestor. A wounded nature comes to the soul and body of the new person from his/her parents, who experience libido (or concupiscence). Augustine's view was that human procreation was the way the transmission was being effected. He did not blame, however, the sexual passion itself, but the spiritual concupiscence present in human nature, soul and body, even after baptismal regeneration.[31] Christian parents transmit their wounded nature to children, because they give them birth, not the \\"re-birth\\".[32] Augustine used Ciceronian Stoic concept of passions, to interpret St. Paul's doctrine of universal sin and redemption. In that view, also sexual desire itself as well as other bodily passions were consequence of the original sin, in which pure affections were wounded by vice and became disobedient to human reason and will. As long as they carry a threat to the dominion of reason over the soul they constitute moral evil, but since they do not presuppose consent, one cannot call them sins. Humanity will be liberated from passions, and pure affections will be restored only when all sin has been washed away and ended, that is in the resurrection of the dead.[33][34]\\r\\nAugustine believed that the only definitive destinations of souls are heaven and hell. He concluded that unbaptized infants go to hell as a consequence of original sin.[35][36] The Latin Church Fathers who followed Augustine adopted his position, which became a point of reference for Latin theologians in the Middle Ages.[37] In the later medieval period, some theologians continued to hold Augustine's view, others held that unbaptized infants suffered no pain at all: unaware of being deprived of the beatific vision, they enjoyed a state of natural, not supernatural happiness. Starting around 1300, unbaptized infants were often said to inhabit the \\"limbo of infants\\".[38] The Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1261 declares: \\"As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused him to say: 'Let the children come to me, do not hinder them',[39] allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism.\\" But the theory of Limbo, while it \\"never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the Magisterium ... remains ... a possible theological hypothesis\\".[40]\\r\\nIn the works of John Cassian (c. 360 ÿ 435), Conference XIII recounts how the wise monk Chaeremon, of whom he is writing, responded to puzzlement caused by his own statement that \\"man even though he strive with all his might for a good result, yet cannot become master of what is good unless he has acquired it simply by the gift of Divine bounty and not by the efforts of his own toil\\" (chapter 1). In chapter 11, Cassian presents Chaeremon as speaking of the cases of Paul the persecutor and Matthew the publican as difficulties for those who say \\"the beginning of free will is in our own power\\", and the cases of Zaccheus and the good thief on the cross as difficulties for those who say \\"the beginning of our free will is always due to the inspiration of the grace of God\\", and as concluding: \\"These two then; viz., the grace of God and free will seem opposed to each other, but really are in harmony, and we gather from the system of goodness that we ought to have both alike, lest if we withdraw one of them from man, we may seem to have broken the rule of the Church's faith: for when God sees us inclined to will what is good, He meets, guides, and strengthens us: for 'At the voice of thy cry, as soon as He shall hear, He will answer thee'; and: 'Call upon Me', He says, 'in the day of tribulation and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me'. And again, if He finds that we are unwilling or have grown cold, He stirs our hearts with salutary exhortations, by which a good will is either renewed or formed in us.\\"[41]\\r\\nCassian did not accept the idea of total depravity, on which Martin Luther was to insist.[42] He taught that human nature is fallen or depraved, but not totally. Augustine Casiday states that, at the same time, Cassian \\"baldly asserts that God's grace, not human free will, is responsible for 'everything which pertains to salvation' ÿ even faith\\".[43] Cassian pointed out that people still have moral freedom and one has the option to choose to follow God. Colm Luibhid says that, according to Cassian, there are cases where the soul makes the first little turn,[44] but in Cassian's view, according to Casiday, any sparks of goodwill that may exist, not directly caused by God, are totally inadequate and only direct divine intervention ensures spiritual progress;[45] and Lauren Pristas says that \\"for Cassian, salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God's grace\\".[46]\\r\\nOpposition to Augustine's ideas about original sin, which he had developed in reaction to Pelagianism, arose rapidly.[47] After a long and bitter struggle the general principles of Augustine's teaching were confirmed within Western Christianity by many councils, especially the Second Council of Orange in 529.[2] However, while the Church condemned Pelagius, it did not endorse Augustine entirely[48] and, while Augustine's authority was accepted, he was interpreted in the light of writers such as Cassian.[49] Some of the followers of Augustine identified original sin with concupiscence[50] in the psychological sense, but this identification was challenged by the 11th-century Saint Anselm of Canterbury, who defined original sin as \\"privation of the righteousness that every man ought to possess\\", thus separating it from concupiscence. In the 12th century the identification of original sin with concupiscence was supported by Peter Lombard and others,[citation needed] but was rejected by the leading theologians in the next century, chief of whom was Thomas Aquinas. He distinguished the supernatural gifts of Adam before the Fall from what was merely natural, and said that it was the former that were lost, privileges that enabled man to keep his inferior powers in submission to reason and directed to his supernatural end. Even after the fall, man thus kept his natural abilities of reason, will and passions. Rigorous Augustine-inspired views persisted among the Franciscans, though the most prominent Franciscan theologians, such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham, eliminated the element of concupiscence.\\r\\nMartin Luther (1483ÿ1546) asserted that humans inherit Adamic guilt and are in a state of sin from the moment of conception. The second article in Lutheranism's Augsburg Confession presents its doctrine of original sin in summary form:\\r\\nIt is also taught among us that since the fall of Adam all men who are born according to the course of nature are conceived and born in sin. That is, all men are full of evil lust and inclinations from their mothers' wombs and are unable by nature to have true fear of God and true faith in God. Moreover, this inborn sickness and hereditary sin is truly sin and condemns to the eternal wrath of God all those who are not born again through Baptism and the Holy Spirit. Rejected in this connection are the Pelagians and others who deny that original sin is sin, for they hold that natural man is made righteous by his own powers, thus disparaging the sufferings and merit of Christ.[51]\\r\\nLuther, however, also agreed with the Roman Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception (that Mary was conceived free from original sin) by saying:\\r\\n[Mary] is full of grace, proclaimed to be entirely without sin. God's grace fills her with everything good and makes her devoid of all evil. God is with her, meaning that all she did or left undone is divine and the action of God in her. Moreover, God guarded and protected her from all that might be hurtful to her.[52]\\r\\nProtestant Reformer John Calvin (1509ÿ1564) developed a systematic theology of Augustinian Protestantism by interpretation of Augustine of Hippo's notion of original sin. Calvin believed that humans inherit Adamic guilt and are in a state of sin from the moment of conception. This inherently sinful nature (the basis for the Calvinistic doctrine of \\"total depravity\\") results in a complete alienation from God and the total inability of humans to achieve reconciliation with God based on their own abilities. Not only do individuals inherit a sinful nature due to Adam's fall, but since he was the federal head and representative of the human race, all whom he represented inherit the guilt of his sin by imputation. Redemption by Jesus Christ is the only remedy.\\r\\nJohn Calvin defined original sin in his Institutes of the Christian Religion as follows:\\r\\nOriginal sin, therefore, seems to be a hereditary depravity and corruption of our nature, diffused into all parts of the soul, which first makes us liable to God's wrath, then also brings forth in us those works which Scripture calls \\"works of the flesh\\" (Gal 5:19). And that is properly what Paul often calls sin. The works that come forth from it ÿ such as adulteries, fornications, thefts, hatreds, murders, carousings ÿ he accordingly calls \\"fruits of sin\\" (Gal 5:19ÿ21), although they are also commonly called \\"sins\\" in Scripture, and even by Paul himself.[53]\\r\\nThe Council of Trent (1545ÿ1563), while not pronouncing on points disputed among Catholic theologians, condemned the teaching that in baptism the whole of what belongs to the essence of sin is not taken away, but is only cancelled or not imputed, and declared the concupiscence that remains after baptism not truly and properly \\"sin\\" in the baptized, but only to be called sin in the sense that it is of sin and inclines to sin.[54]\\r\\nIn 1567, soon after the close of the Council of Trent, Pope Pius V went beyond Trent by sanctioning Aquinas's distinction between nature and supernature in Adam's state before the Fall, condemned the identification of original sin with concupiscence, and approved the view that the unbaptized could have right use of will.[2]\\r\\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church says:\\r\\nBy his sin Adam, as the first man, lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all humans.\\r\\nAdam and Eve transmitted to their descendants human nature wounded by their own first sin and hence deprived of original holiness and justice; this deprivation is called \\"original sin\\".\\r\\nAs a result of original sin, human nature is weakened in its powers, subject to ignorance, suffering and the domination of death, and inclined to sin (this inclination is called \\"concupiscence\\").[55]\\r\\nThe Catholic Church teaches that every human person born on this earth is made in the image of God.[56][57] Within man \\"is both the powerful surge toward the good because we are made in the image of God, and the darker impulses toward evil because of the effects of Original Sin\\".[58] Furthermore, it explicitly denies that we inherit guilt from anyone, maintaining that instead we inherit our fallen nature. In this it differs from the Calvinist/Protestant position that each person actually inherits Adam's guilt, and teaches instead that \\"original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants ... but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man\\".[59] \\"In other words, human beings do not bear any 'original guilt' from Adam and Eve's particular sin.\\"[60]\\r\\nThe Church has always held baptism to be \\"for the remission of sins\\", and, as mentioned in Catechism of the Catholic Church, 403, infants too have traditionally been baptized, though not guilty of any actual personal sin. The sin that through baptism was remitted for them could only be original sin, with which they were connected by the very fact of being a human. The first comprehensive theological explanation of this practice of baptizing infants, guilty of no actual personal sin, was given by Saint Augustine of Hippo, not all of whose ideas on original sin have been adopted by the Catholic Church. Indeed, the Church has condemned the interpretation of some of his ideas by certain leaders of the Protestant Reformation.\\r\\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church explains that in \\"yielding to the tempter, Adam and Eve committed a personal sin, but this sin affected the human nature that they would then transmit in a fallen state ... original sin is called \\"sin\\" only in an analogical sense: it is a sin \\"contracted\\" and not \\"committed\\"a state and not an act\\" (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 404). This \\"state of deprivation of the original holiness and justice ... transmitted to the descendants of Adam along with human nature\\" (Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 76) involves no personal responsibility or personal guilt on their part (cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, 405). Personal responsibility and guilt were Adam's, who because of his sin, was unable to pass on to his descendants a human nature with the holiness with which it would otherwise have been endowed, in this way implicating them in his sin. The doctrine of original sin thus does not impute the sin of the father to his children, but merely states that they inherit from him a \\"human nature deprived of original holiness and justice\\", which is \\"transmitted by propagation to all mankind\\".[61]\\r\\nIn the theology of the Catholic Church, original sin is regarded as the general condition of sinfulness, that is the absence of holiness and perfect charity into which humans are born, distinct from the actual sins that a person commits. This teaching explicitly states that \\"original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants\\".[59] In other words, human beings do not bear any \\"original guilt\\" from Adam's particular sin, which is his alone. The prevailing view, also held in Eastern Orthodoxy, is that human beings bear no guilt for the sin of Adam. The Catholic Church teaches: \\"By our first parents' sin, the devil has acquired a certain domination over man, even though man remains free.\\"[62]\\r\\nThe Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary is that Mary was conceived free from original sin: \\"the most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege of almighty God and by virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, Savior of the human race, preserved immune from all stain of original sin\\".[63] The doctrine sees her as an exception to the general rule that human beings are not immune from the reality of original sin.\\r\\nSoon after the Second Vatican Council, biblical theologian Herbert Haag raised the question: Is original sin in Scripture?[64] According to his exegesis, Genesis 2:25 indicates that Adam and Eve were created from the beginning naked of the divine grace, an originary grace that, then, they would never have had and even less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated. On the other hand, while supporting a continuity in the Bible about the absence of preternatural gifts (Latin: dona praeternaturalia)[65] with regard to the ophitic event, Haag never makes any reference to the discontinuity of the loss of access to the tree of life.\\r\\nThe Eastern Orthodox version of original sin is the view that sin originates with the Devil, \\"for the devil sinneth from the beginning (1 John iii. 8)\\".[66] They acknowledge that the introduction of ancestral sin[67][better?source?needed] into the human race affected the subsequent environment for humanity (see also traducianism). However, they never accepted Augustine of Hippo's notions of original sin and hereditary guilt.[68][better?source?needed]\\r\\nOrthodox Churches accept the teachings of John Cassian, as do Catholic Churches eastern and western,[42] in rejecting the doctrine of total depravity, by teaching that human nature is \\"fallen\\", that is, depraved, but not totally. Augustine Casiday states that Cassian \\"baldly asserts that God's grace, not human free will, is responsible for 'everything which pertains to salvation' ÿ even faith\\".[43] Cassian points out that people still have moral freedom and one has the option to choose to follow God. Colm Luibhid says that, according to Cassian, there are cases where the soul makes the first little turn,[44] while Augustine Casiday says that, in Cassian's view, any sparks of goodwill that may exist, not directly caused by God, are totally inadequate and only direct divine intervention ensures spiritual progress.[45] and Lauren Pristas says that \\"for Cassian, salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God's grace\\".[46]\\r\\nEastern Orthodoxy accepts the doctrine of ancestral sin: \\"Original sin is hereditary. It did not remain only Adam and Eve's. As life passes from them to all of their descendants, so does original sin.\\"[69] \\"As from an infected source there naturally flows an infected stream, so from a father infected with sin, and consequently mortal, there naturally proceeds a posterity infected like him with sin, and like him mortal.\\"[70]\\r\\nThe Orthodox Church in America makes clear the distinction between \\"fallen nature\\" and \\"fallen man\\" and this is affirmed in the early teaching of the Church whose role it is to act as the catalyst that leads to true or inner redemption. Every human person born on this earth bears the image of God undistorted within themselves.[71] In the Orthodox Christian understanding, they explicitly deny that humanity inherited guilt from anyone. Rather, they maintain that we inherit our fallen nature. While humanity does bear the consequences of the original, or first, sin, humanity does not bear the personal guilt associated with this sin. Adam and Eve are guilty of their willful action; we bear the consequences, chief of which is death.\\"[72]\\r\\nThe view of the Eastern Orthodox Church varies on whether Mary is free of all actual sin or concupiscence. Some Patristic sources imply that she was cleansed from sin at the Annunciation, while the liturgical references are unanimous that she is all-holy from the time of her conception.[73][74]\\r\\nThe original formularies of the Church of England also continue in the Reformation understanding of original sin. In the Thirty-Nine Articles, Article IX \\"Of Original or Birth-sin\\" states:\\r\\nOriginal Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do vainly talk); but it is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every man, that naturally is ingendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in the Greek, ϫ ϫϰ?, which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh, is not subject to the Law of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.[75]\\r\\nHowever, more recent doctrinal statements (e.g. the 1938 report Doctrine in the Church of England) permit a greater variety of understandings of this doctrine. The 1938 report summarizes:\\r\\nMan is by nature capable of communion with God, and only through such communion can he become what he was created to be. \\"Original sin\\" stands for the fact that from a time apparently prior to any responsible act of choice man is lacking in this communion, and if left to his own resources and to the influence of his natural environment cannot attain to his destiny as a child of God.[76]\\r\\nThe Methodist Church upholds Article VII in the Articles of Religion in the Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church:\\r\\nOriginal sin standeth not in the following of Adam (as the Pelagians do vainly talk), but it is the corruption of the nature of every man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and of his own nature inclined to evil, and that continually.[77]\\r\\nSeventh-day Adventists believe that humans are inherently sinful due to the fall of Adam,[78] but they do not totally accept the Augustinian/Calvinistic understanding of original sin, taught in terms of original guilt, but hold more to what could be termed the \\"total depravity\\" tradition.[79] Seventh-day Adventists have historically preached a doctrine of inherited weakness, but not a doctrine of inherited guilt.[80] According to Augustine and Calvin, humanity inherits not only Adam's depraved nature but also the actual guilt of his transgression, and Adventists look more toward the Wesleyan model.[81]\\r\\nIn part, the Adventist position on original sin reads:\\r\\nThe nature of the penalty for original sin, i.e., Adam's sin, is to be seen as literal, physical, temporal, or actual death ÿ the opposite of life, i.e., the cessation of being. By no stretch of the scriptural facts can death be spiritualised as depravity. God did not punish Adam by making him a sinner. That was Adams own doing. All die the first death because of Adams sin regardless of their moral character ÿ children included.[81]\\r\\nEarly Adventists Pioneers (such as George Storrs and Uriah Smith) tended to de-emphasise the morally corrupt nature inherited from Adam, while stressing the importance of actual, personal sins committed by the individual. They thought of the \\"sinful nature\\" in terms of physical mortality rather than moral depravity.[81] Traditionally, Adventists look at sin in terms of willful transgressions, and that Christ triumphed over sin. Adventism believes that Christ is both our Substitute and our Example.[82] They base their belief on texts such as \\"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.\\" (1 John 3:4)[83]\\r\\nThough believing in the concept of inherited sin from Adam, there is no dogmatic Adventist position on original sin. Related articles dealing with the subject are publicly available on the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Churchs official website on theological doctrine, the Biblical Research Institute.[84]\\r\\nAccording to the theology of the Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, all humans are born sinners, because of inheriting sin, corruption, and death from Adam. They teach that Adam was originally created perfect and sinless, but with free will; that the Devil, who was originally a perfect angel, but later developed feelings of pride and self-importance, seduced Eve, and then through her, persuaded Adam to disobey God, and to obey the Devil instead, rebelling against God's sovereignty, thereby making themselves sinners, and because of that, transmitting a sinful nature to all of their future offspring.[85][86] Instead of destroying the Devil right away, as well as destroying the disobedient couple, God decided to test the loyalty of the rest of humankind, and to prove that man cannot be independent of God successfully, that man is lost without God's laws and standards, and can never bring peace to the earth, and that Satan was a deceiver, murderer, and liar.[87]\\r\\nWitnesses believe that all men possess \\"inherited sin\\" from the \\"one man\\" Adam and they teach that verses such as Romans 5:12-22, Psalm 51:5, Job 14:4, and 1st Corinthians 15:22 show that man is born corrupt, and dies because of inherited sin and imperfection, that inherited sin is the reason and cause for sickness and suffering, made worse by the Devil's wicked influence. They believe Jesus is the \\"second Adam\\", being the sinless Son of God and the Messiah, and that he came to undo Adamic sin; and that salvation and everlasting life can only be obtained through faith and obedience to the second Adam.[85][86][87][88][89][90] They believe that \\"sin\\" is \\"missing the mark\\" of God's standard of perfection, and that everyone is born a sinner, due to being the offspring of sinner Adam.[91]\\r\\nThe Book of Mormon, a text sacred to Mormonism, explains that the opportunity to live here in a world where we can learn good and bad is a gift from God, and not a punishment for Adam's and Eve's choice.[92] As Mormon founder Joseph Smith taught, humans had an essentially godlike nature, and were not only holy in a premortal state, but had the potential to progress eternally to become like God.[93] He wrote as one of his church's Articles of Faith, \\"We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adams transgression.\\"[94] Later Mormons took this creed as a rejection of the doctrine of original sin and any notion of inherited sinfulness.[93] Thus, while modern Mormons will agree that the fall of Adam brought consequences to the world, including the possibility of sin, they generally reject the idea that any culpability is automatically transmitted to Adam and Eve's offspring.[95] Children under the age of eight are regarded as free of all sin and therefore do not require baptism.[96] Children who die prior to age eight are believed to be saved in the highest degree of heaven.[97]\\r\\nIn Swedenborgianism, exegesis of the first 11 chapters of Genesis from The First Church, has a view that Adam is not an individual person. Rather, he is a symbolic representation of the \\"Most Ancient Church\\", having a more direct contact with heaven than all other successive churches.[98][99] Swedenborg's view of original sin is referred to as hereditary evil, which passes from generation to generation.[100] It cannot be completely abolished by an individual man, but can be tempered when someone reforms their own life,[101] and are thus held accountable only for their own sins.[102]\\r\\nMost Quakers (also known as the Religious Society of Friends), including the founder of Quakerism, George Fox, believe in the doctrine of Inward light, a doctrine which states that there is \\"that of God in everyone\\".[103] This has led to a common belief among many liberal and universalist Quakers affiliated with the Friends General Conference and Britain Yearly Meeting, based on the ideas of Quaker Rufus Jones among others, that rather than being burdened by original sin, human beings are inherently good, and the doctrine of universal reconciliation, that is, that all people will eventually be saved and reconciled with God.\\r\\nHowever, this rejection of the doctrine of original sin or the necessity of salvation is not something that most conservative or evangelical Quakers affiliated with Friends United Meeting or Evangelical Friends Church International tend to agree with. Although the more conservative and evangelical Quakers also believe in the doctrine of inward light, they interpret it in a manner consistent with the doctrine of original sin, namely, that people may or may not listen to the voice of God within them and be saved, and people who do not listen will not be saved, thus there cannot be any universal reconciliation under the more conservative Quaker theology. Many more liberal Quaker meetings have no official creed and allow individual Quakers to have a wide variety of different beliefs, although following the recommendations of one's yearly meeting's Faith and Practice book is strongly recommended even though not mandatory.\\r\\nAlso, not all local Quaker meetings are entirely liberal or conservative and some have members adhering to different Quaker traditions, and a Quaker meeting can be affiliated with both liberal and conservative umbrella organizations. For instance, New York Yearly Meeting, which is mostly liberal, is affiliated with both the liberal Friends General Conference as well as the conservative Friends United Meeting, even though they adhere much more to the liberal teachings of Friends General Conference than the conservative teachings of Friends United Meeting.[104][105] Thus, at any given Quaker meeting, individual Quakers may have differing views on a wide variety of theological issues including original sin, with more conservative Quaker meetings having everyone believe in original sin while at more liberal Quaker meetings there is typically a variety of beliefs and usually a majority of people would not believe in original sin but a minority would believe in original sin.\\r\\nThe doctrine of \\"inherited sin\\" is not found in most of mainstream Judaism. Although some in Orthodox Judaism place blame on Adam for overall corruption of the world, and though there were some Jewish teachers in Babylon[106] who believed that mortality was a punishment brought upon humanity on account of Adam's sin, that is not the dominant view in most of Judaism today. Modern Judaism generally teaches that humans are born sin-free and untainted, and choose to sin later and bring suffering to themselves.[107][108]\\r\\nJewish theologians are divided in regard to the cause of what is called \\"original sin\\". Some teach that it was due to Adam's yielding to temptation in eating of the forbidden fruit and has been inherited by his descendants; the majority of chazalic opinions, however, do not hold Adam responsible for the sins of humanity,[109] teaching that, in Genesis 8:21 and 6:5-8, God recognized that Adam did not willfully sin. However, Adam is recognized by some[106] as having brought death into the world by his disobedience. Because of his sin, his descendants will live a mortal life, which will end in death of their bodies.[110]\\r\\nThe concept of inherited sin does not exist in Islam.[111][112] Islam teaches that Adam and Eve sinned, but then sought forgiveness and thus were forgiven by God.[113]\\r\\nThe Qur'an says that after Adam and Eve sinned, they asked for repentance and it was granted:\\r\\nThey said: \\"Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves souls. If You forgive us not and bestow not upon us Your mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers.\\r\\nThus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray. Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.\\r\\nThe Qur'an further says about individual responsibility:\\r\\nThat no burdened person (with sins) shall bear the burden (sins) of another. And that man can have nothing but what he does (of good and bad). And that his deeds will be seen, Then he will be recompensed with a full and the best [fair] recompense.","input":"What was the first sin in the bible?"},{"output":"Chuck Lorre","context":"The Big Bang Theory is an American television sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, both of whom serve as executive producers on the series, along with Steven Molaro. All three also serve as head writers. The show premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.[3] In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to twelve, and running through the 2018ÿ19 television season. The eleventh season premiered on September 25, 2017.[4]\\r\\nThe show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists at Caltech, who share an apartment; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who later becomes a pharmaceutical representative and who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's similarly geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four men are contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.[5][6]\\r\\nOver time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle, a physicist who dated Leonard and Howard; neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler, who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon on a dating website (and later becomes Sheldon's girlfriend); Bernadette Rostenkowski, Howard's wife (previously his girlfriend), a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; Stuart Bloom, the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit; and Emily Sweeney, a dermatologist who dated Raj.\\r\\nThe structure of the original, unaired pilot, developed for the 2006ÿ07 television season, was substantially different from the series' current form. The only characters retained in both pilots were Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons), who are named after Sheldon Leonard, a longtime figure in episodic television as producer, director and actor. Althea (Vernee Watson) was a character featured in both pilots and the first series episode.[7] Two female leads were Canadian actress Amanda Walsh as Katie, \\"a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior,\\"[8][9] and Iris Bahr as Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend of the male characters. Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up with a boyfriend and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to Katie, but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used Thomas Dolby's hit \\"She Blinded Me with Science\\" as its theme song.\\r\\nAlthough the show was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny (Kaley Cuoco). The original unaired pilot never has officially been released, but it has circulated on the Internet.[citation needed] On the evolution of the show, Chuck Lorre said, \\"We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal.\\" As to whether the world will ever see the original pilot on a future DVD release, Lorre said, \\"Wow, that would be something. We will see. Show your failures...\\"[10]\\r\\nThe first and second pilots of The Big Bang Theory were directed by James Burrows, who did not continue with the show. The reworked second pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14, 2007.[11] Prior to its airing on CBS, the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge. The show premiered on September 24, 2007, and was picked up for a full 22-episode season on October 19, 2007.[12] The show is filmed in front of a live audience,[13] and is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.[14] Production was halted on November 6, 2007, due to the Writers Guild of America strike. Nearly three months later, on February 4, 2008, the series was temporarily replaced by a short-lived sitcom, Welcome to the Captain. The series returned on March 17, 2008, in an earlier time slot[15] and ultimately only 17 episodes were produced for the first season.[16][17]\\r\\nAfter the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season, airing in the 2008ÿ2009 season, premiering in the same time slot on September 22, 2008.[18] With increasing ratings, the show received a two-year renewal through the 2010ÿ11 season in 2009.[19][20] In 2011, the show was picked up for three more seasons.[21] In March 2014, the show was renewed again for three more years through the 2016ÿ17 season. This marks the second time the series has gained a three-year renewal.[22] In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to 12, and running through the 2018ÿ19 television season.[23]\\r\\nDavid Saltzberg, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, checks scripts and provides dialogue, mathematics equations, and diagrams used as props.[5] According to executive producer/co-creator Bill Prady, \\"We're working on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on throughout the [first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... . We worked hard to get all the science right.\\"[6]\\r\\nSeveral of the actors in The Big Bang Theory previously worked together on the sitcom Roseanne, including Johnny Galecki, Sara Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf (who plays Sheldon's mother, Mary Cooper), and Meagen Fay (who plays Bernadette's mother). Additionally, Lorre was a writer on the series for several seasons.\\r\\nThe Canadian alternative rock band Barenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer Ed Robertson was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles. By coincidence, Robertson had recently read Simon Singh's book Big Bang,[24][25] and at the concert improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe.[citation needed] Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows, but ending up being rejected because of producer's favor of other artist's song, Robertson agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the song was released commercially.[26] Although some sources identify the song title as \\"History of Everything,\\"[27] the cover art for the single identifies the title as \\"Big Bang Theory Theme.\\" A music video also was released via special features on The Complete Fourth Season DVD and Blu-ray set.[28][29] The theme was included on the band's greatest hits album, Hits from Yesterday & the Day Before, released on September 27, 2011.[30] In September 2015, TMZ uncovered court documents showing that Steven Page sued former bandmate Robertson over the song, alleging that he was promised 20% of the proceeds, but that Robertson has kept that money entirely for himself.[31]\\r\\nFor the first three seasons, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco, the three main stars of the show, received at most $60,000 per episode. The salary for the three went up to $200,000 per episode for the fourth season. Their per-episode pay went up an additional $50,000 in each of the following three seasons, culminating in $350,000 per episode in the seventh season.[32][33] In September 2013, Bialik and Rauch renegotiated the contracts they held since they were introduced to the series in 2010. On their old contracts, each was making $20,000ÿ$30,000 per episode, while the new contracts doubled that, beginning at $60,000 per episode, increasing steadily to $100,000 per episode by the end of the contract, as well as adding another year for both.[34]\\r\\nBy season seven, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco were also receiving 0.25% of the series' back-end money. Before production began on the eighth season, the three plus Helberg and Nayyar, looked to renegotiate new contracts, with Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco seeking around $1 million per episode, as well as more back-end money.[35] Contracts were signed in the beginning of August 2014, giving the three principal actors an estimated $1 million per episode for three years, with the possibility to extend for a fourth year. The deals also include larger pieces of the show, signing bonuses, production deals, and advances towards the back-end.[36] Helberg and Nayyar were also able to renegotiate their contracts, giving them a per-episode pay in the \\"mid-six-figure range\\", up from around $100,000 per episode they each received in years prior. The duo, who were looking to have salary parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco, signed their contracts after the studio and producers threatened to write the characters out of the series if a deal could not be reached before the start of production on season eight.[37] By season 10, Helberg and Nayyar reached the $1 million per episode parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco, due to a clause in their deals signed in 2014.[38]\\r\\nIn March 2017, the main cast members (Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg, and Nayyar) took a 10% pay cut to allow Bialik and Rauch an increase in their earnings.[39] This put Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg and Nayyar at $900,000 per episode, with Parsons, Galecki, and Helberg also receiving overall deals with Warner Bros. Television.[23] By the end of April, Bialik and Rauch had signed deals to earn $500,000 per episode, each, with the deals also including a separate development component for both actors. The deal was an increase from the $175,000 ÿ $200,000 the duo had been making per episode.[40]\\r\\nThese actors are credited in all episodes of the series:\\r\\nThese actors were first credited as guest stars and later promoted to main cast:\\r\\nAs the theme of the show revolves around science, many distinguished and high-profile scientists have appeared as guest stars on the show. Famous astrophysicist and Nobel laureate George Smoot had a cameo appearance in the second season.[55] Theoretical physicist Brian Greene appeared in the fourth season, as well as astrophysicist, science populizer, and physics outreach specialist Neil deGrasse Tyson.\\r\\nCosmologist Stephen Hawking made a short guest appearance in the fifth-season episode;[56] in the eighth season, Hawking video conferences with Sheldon and Leonard, and makes another appearance in the 200th episode. In the fifth and sixth seasons, NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino played himself multiple times in the role of Howard's fellow astronaut. Bill Nye appeared in the seventh season, and Elon Musk made an appearance in the ninth season.\\r\\nMuch of the series focuses on science, particularly physics. The four main male characters are employed at Caltech and have science-related occupations, as do Bernadette and Amy. The characters frequently banter about scientific theories or news (notably around the start of the show), and make science-related jokes.\\r\\nScience has also interfered with the characters' romantic lives. Leslie breaks up with Leonard when he sides with Sheldon in his support for string theory rather than loop quantum gravity.[68] When Leonard joins Sheldon, Raj, and Howard on a three-month Arctic research trip, it separates Leonard and Penny at a time their relationship is budding. When Bernadette takes an interest in Leonard's work, it makes both Penny and Howard envious and results in Howard confronting Leonard, and Penny asking Sheldon to teach her physics.[69] Sheldon and Amy also briefly end their relationship after an argument over which of their fields is superior.[70]\\r\\nDavid Saltzberg, who has a PhD in physics, has served as the science consultant for the show for six seasons and attends every taping.[71] While Saltzberg knows physics, he sometimes needs assistance from Mayim Bialik, who has a PhD in neuroscience.[72] Saltzberg sees early versions of scripts which need scientific information added to them, and he also points out where the writers, despite their knowledge of science, have made a mistake. He is usually not needed during a taping unless a lot of science, and especially the whiteboard, is involved.[72]\\r\\nThe four main male characters are all avid science fiction, fantasy, and comic book fans and memorabilia collectors.\\r\\nStar Trek in particular is frequently referenced and Sheldon identifies strongly with the character of Spock, so much so that when he is given a used napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy as a Christmas gift from Penny he is overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude (\\"I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!\\").[73] Star Trek: The Original Series cast member George Takei has made a cameo, and Leonard Nimoy made a cameo as the voice of Sheldon's vintage Mr. Spock action figure (both cameos were in dream sequences). Star Trek: The Next Generation cast members Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton have had cameos as themselves,[74][75] while Wil Wheaton has a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself.\\r\\nThey are also fans of Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and Doctor Who. In the episode \\"The Ornithophobia Diffusion\\", when there is a delay in watching Star Wars on Blu-ray, Howard complains, \\"If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again\\" (referring to Lucas' controversial alterations to the films) and in \\"The Hot Troll Deviation\\", Katee Sackhoff of Battlestar Galactica appeared as Howard's fantasy dream girl. The characters have different tastes in franchises with Sheldon praising Firefly but disapproving of Leonard's enjoyment of Babylon 5.[76][n 1] With regard to fantasy, the four make frequent references to The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter novels and movies. Additionally, Howard can speak Sindarin, one of the two Elvish languages from The Lord of the Rings.\\r\\nWednesday night is the group's designated \\"comic book night\\"[77] because that is the day of the week when new comic books are released. The comic book store is run by fellow geek and recurring character Stuart. On a number of occasions, the group members have dressed up as pop culture characters, including The Flash, Aquaman, Frodo Baggins, Superman, Batman, Spock, The Doctor, Green Lantern, and Thor.[78] As a consequence of losing a bet to Stuart and Wil Wheaton, the group members are forced to visit the comic book store dressed as Catwoman, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and Supergirl.[79] DC Comics announced that, to promote its comics, the company will sponsor Sheldon wearing Green Lantern T-shirts.[80]\\r\\nVarious games have been featured, as well as referenced, on the series (e.g. World of Warcraft, Halo, Mario, etc.), including fictional games like Mystic Warlords of Ka'a (which became a reality in 2011)[81] and Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.\\r\\nOne of the recurring plot lines is the relationship between Leonard and Penny. Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Meanwhile, Penny dates a series of muscular, attractive, unintelligent, and insensitive jocks. Their first long term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the North Pole in the season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her, she realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny, and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in \\"The Good Guy Fluctuation\\".\\r\\nPenny, who admits to missing Leonard in \\"The Roommate Transmogrification\\", accepts his request to renew their relationship in \\"The Beta Test Initiation\\". After Penny suggests having sex in \\"The Launch Acceleration\\", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says \\"no\\" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in \\"The Tangible Affection Proof\\". In the sixth-season episode, \\"The 43 Peculiarity\\", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in \\"The Bon Voyage Reaction\\". After Leonard returns, their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode \\"The Gorilla Dissolution\\", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another woman, Mandy Chow (Melissa Tang) while on an expedition on the North Sea. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere.\\r\\nIn the third-season finale, Raj and Howard search for a woman compatible with Sheldon and discover neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler. Like him, she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In \\"The Agreement Dissection\\", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon says \\"fascinating\\" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in \\"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\\". The same night he draws up \\"The Relationship Agreement\\" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his \\"Roommate Agreement\\" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it.\\r\\nIn the episode \\"The Launch Acceleration\\", Amy tries to use her \\"neurobiology bag of tricks\\" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. In the final fifth-season episode \\"The Countdown Reflection\\", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode \\"The Date Night Variable\\", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In \\"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\\" Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that \\"it's a possibility\\" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in \\"The Love Spell Potential\\". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.[82]\\r\\n\\"The Locomotive Manipulation\\" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season, and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However, in \\"The Prom Equivalency\\", he hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a panic attack.\\r\\nIn the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their fifth anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday.\\r\\nIn the season eleven premiere , Sheldon proposes to Amy and she accepts .\\r\\nIn scenes set at Howard's home, he interacts with his rarely-seen mother (voiced by Carol Ann Susi until her death) by shouting from room to room in the house. She similarly interacts with other characters in this manner.[83] She reflects the Jewish mother stereotype in some ways, such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes trying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble. She is dependent on Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning. Howard in turn is attached to his mother to the point where she still cuts his meat for him, takes him to the dentist, does his laundry and \\"grounds\\" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.[84] Until Howard's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth-season finale, Howard's former living situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may suffer from some type of pathology,[85] and Sheldon to refer to their relationship as Oedipal.[86] In season 8, Howard's mother dies in her sleep while in Florida, which devastates Howard and Stuart, who briefly lived with Mrs. Wolowitz.\\r\\nLike most shows created by Chuck Lorre, The Big Bang Theory ends by showing a vanity card written by Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo. These cards are archived on Lorre's website.[87]\\r\\nThrough the use of his vanity cards at the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been plagiarized by a show produced and aired in Belarus. Officially titled ׿ѿҿ (The Theorists), the show features \\"clones\\" of the main characters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts.[88] Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Bros. legal department about options. The television production company and station's close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government.[89]\\r\\nHowever, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as soon as it became known that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the producers cancelled it.[90] Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's counterpart, \\"Seva\\") said in an interview, \\"I'm upset. At first, the actors were told all legal issues were resolved. We didn't know it wasn't the case, so when the creators of The Big Bang Theory started talking about the show, I was embarrassed. I can't understand why our people first do, and then think. I consider this to be the rock bottom of my career. And I don't want to take part in a stolen show\\".[91]\\r\\nInitial reception for the series was mixed. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 55% approval rating for the first season based on reviews from 22 critics, with an average rating of 5.18/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Big Bang Theory brings a new class of character to mainstream television, but much of the comedy feels formulaic and stiff.\\"[92] On Metacritic, the season holds a score of 57 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".[93] Later seasons received more acclaim and in 2013, TV Guide ranked the series #52 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.[94]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory started off slowly in the ratings, failing to make the top 50 in its first season (ranking 68th), and ranking 40th in its second season. When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, however, The Big Bang Theory ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 18ÿ49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83?million viewers.[95] After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday nights, CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the 2010ÿ2011 schedule, to be in direct competition with NBC's Comedy Block and Fox's American Idol (then the longest reigning leading primetime show on U.S. television from 2004 to 2011).[96] During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated comedy, just barely beating out eight-year champ Two and a Half Men. However, in the age 18ÿ49 demographic (the show's target age range), it was the second highest rated comedy, behind ABC's Modern Family. The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14 million.[97]\\r\\nThe sixth season boasts some of the highest-rated episodes for the show so far, with a then-new series high set with \\"The Bakersfield Expedition\\", with 20 million viewers,[98] a first for the series, which along with NCIS, made CBS the first network to have two scripted series reach that large an audience in the same week since 2007. In the sixth season, the show became the highest rated and viewed scripted show in the 18ÿ49 demographic, trailing only the live regular NBC Sunday Night Football coverage,[99][100] and was third in total viewers, trailing NCIS and Sunday Night Football.[101] Season seven of the series opened strong, continuing the success gained in season six, with the second episode of the premiere, \\"The Deception Verification\\", setting the new series high in viewers with 20.44 million.[102][103]\\r\\nShowrunner Steve Molaro, who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season, credits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in off-network syndication, particularly on TBS, while Michael Schneider of TV Guide attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier. Chuck Lorre and CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the influence of Molaro, in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly established regular characters and their interpersonal relationships, such as the on-again, off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny.[104] Throughout much of the 2012ÿ13 season, The Big Bang Theory placed first in all of syndication ratings, receiving formidable competition from only Judge Judy and Wheel of Fortune (first-run syndication programs). By the end of the 2012ÿ13 television season, The Big Bang Theory had dethroned Judge Judy as the ratings leader in all of syndicated programming with 7.1, Judy descending to second place for that season with a 7.0.[105] The Big Bang Theory did not place first in syndication ratings for the 2013ÿ14 television season, beaten out by Judge Judy.[106]\\r\\nThe show made its United Kingdom debut on Channel 4 on February 14, 2008. The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot E4 prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009 at 9:00?p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00?p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.[138]\\r\\nThe fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011. Season 5 began airing on November 3, 2011 at 8:00?p.m. as part of E4's Comedy Thursdays, acting as a lead-in to the channel's newest comedy, Perfect Couples. Episode 19, the highest-viewed episode of the season, attracted 1.4?million viewers.[139] Season 6 premiered on November 15, 2012, with 1.89 million viewers and a further 469,000 on the time shift channel, bringing the total to 2.31 million, E4's highest viewing ratings of 2012, and the highest the channel had received since June 2011. The sixth season returned in mid 2013 to finish airing the remaining episodes.[140] Season 7 premiered on E4 on October 31, 2013 at 8:30pm and hit multiple ratings records this season. The second half of season seven aired in mid 2014.[141] The eighth season premiered on E4 on October 23, 2014 at 8:30?p.m.[142] During its eighth season, The Big Bang Theory shared its 8:30?p.m. time period with fellow CBS comedy, 2 Broke Girls. Following the airing of the first eight episodes of that show's fourth season, The Big Bang Theory returned to finish airing its eighth season on March 19, 2015.[143]\\r\\nNetflix UK & Ireland announced on February 13, 2016 that seasons 1ÿ8 would be available to stream from February 15, 2016.[144]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory started off quietly in Canada, but managed to garner major success in later seasons. The Big Bang Theory is telecast throughout Canada via the CTV Television Network in simultaneous substitution with cross-border CBS affiliates. Now immensely popular in Canada, The Big Bang Theory is also rerun daily on the Canadian cable channel The Comedy Network.\\r\\nThe season 4 premiere garnered an estimated 3.1 million viewers across Canada. This is the largest audience for a sitcom since the series finale of Friends (12.4 million viewers). The Big Bang Theory has pulled ahead and has now become the most-watched entertainment television show in Canada.[145]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory premiered in the United States on September 24, 2007 on CBS. The series debuted in Canada on CTV in September 2007.[146] On February 14, 2008, the series debuted in the United Kingdom on channels E4 and Channel 4.[147] In Australia the first seven seasons of the series began airing on the Seven Network and 7mate from October 2015 and also gained the rights to season 8 in 2016, though the Nine Network has rights to air seasons nine & ten.[148][149]\\r\\nIn May 2010, it was reported that the show had been picked up for syndication, mainly among Fox's owned and operated stations and other local stations, with Warner Bros. Television's sister cable network TBS holding the show's cable syndication rights. Broadcast of old shows began airing in September 2011. TBS now airs the series in primetime on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, with evening broadcasts on Saturdays (TBS's local sister station in Atlanta also holds local weeknight rights to the series).[150] Although details of the syndication deal have not been revealed, it was reported the deal \\"set a record price for a cable off-network sitcom purchase\\".[151] CTV holds national broadcast syndication rights in Canada, while sister cable network The Comedy Network holds cable rights.\\r\\nWarner Bros.

In 2012, Warner Bros. released the first two seasons on Blu-ray,[187] marking the first time that all episodes were available on the Blu-ray disc format.\\r\\nIn August 2009, the sitcom won the best comedy series TCA award and Jim Parsons (Sheldon) won the award for individual achievement in comedy.[188] In 2010, the show won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy, while Parsons won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.[189] On January 16, 2011, Parsons was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series?ÿ Comedy or Musical, an award that was presented by co-star Kaley Cuoco. On September 18, 2011, Parsons was again awarded an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. On January 9, 2013, the show won People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy for a second time. August 25, 2014, Jim Parsons was awarded an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series.[190] The Big Bang Theory also won the 2016 People's Choice Awards for under Favorite TV Show and Favorite Network TV Comedy with Jim Parsons winning Favorite Comedic TV Actor.[191] On January 20, 2016, The Big Bang Theory also won the International category at the UK's National Television Awards.[192]\\r\\nOn March 16, 2014, a Lego Ideas project[193] portraying the living room scene in Lego style with the main cast as minifigures reached 10,000 supporters on the platform, which qualified it to be considered as an official set by the Lego Ideas review board. On November 7, 2014, Lego Ideas approved the design and began refining it. The set was released in August 2015, with an exclusive pre-sale taking place at the San Diego Comic-Con International.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a spin-off of The Big Bang Theory centered on Sheldon as a young boy. The prequel series, described as \\"a Malcolm in the Middle-esque single-camera family comedy\\" would be executive produced by Lorre and Molaro, with Prady expected to be involved in some capacity, and intended to air in the 2017ÿ18 season alongside The Big Bang Theory.[194][195] The initial idea for the series came from Parsons, who passed it along to The Big Bang Theory producers.[196] In early March 2017, Iain Armitage was cast as the younger Sheldon, as well as Zoe Perry as his mother, Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who portrays Mary Cooper on The Big Bang Theory.[196]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off Young Sheldon series. Jon Favreau will direct and executive produce the pilot. Created by Lorre and Molaro, the series follows 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper as he attends high school in East Texas. Alongside Armitage as 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper and Perry as Mary Cooper, Lance Barber stars as George Cooper, Sheldon's father; Raegan Revord stars as Missy Cooper, Sheldon's twin sister; and Montana Jordan as George Cooper Jr., Sheldon's older brother. Jim Parsons reprises his role as adult Sheldon Cooper, as narrator for the series. Parsons, Lorre, Molaro and Todd Spiewak will also serve as executive producers on the series, for Chuck Lorre Productions, Inc. in association with Warner Bros.

It had a special preview on September 25, 2017.[198]","input":"Who created the show the big bang theory?"},{"output":"16th century","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nGuru Granth Sahib (Punjabi: ???? ????? ?????, Punjabi pronunciation:?[??u ??nt? sh?b]) is the religious scripture of Sikhism, regarded by Sikhs as the final, sovereign, and eternal living guru following the lineage of the ten human Sikh gurus of the Sikh religion.[1] Adi Granth, the first rendition, was compiled by the fifth Sikh guru, Guru Arjan. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, added one salok, dohra mahala 9 ang, 1429 and all 115 hymns of his father, Guru Tegh Bahadur.[2] This second rendition came to be known as Sri Guru Granth Sahib.[3] After Guru Gobind Singh's death in 1708, Baba Deep Singh and Bhai Mani Singh prepared many copies of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji for distribution.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe text consists of 1,430 angs (pages) and 6,000 ?abads (line compositions),[5][6] which are poetically rendered and set to a rhythmic ancient north Indian classical form of music.[7] The bulk of the scripture is divided into thirty-one rgas, with each Granth rga subdivided according to length and author. The hymns in the scripture are arranged primarily by the rgas in which they are read.[5] The Guru Granth Sahib is written in the Gurmukhؐ script, in various languages, including Lahnda (Western Punjabi), Braj Bhasha, Khariboli, Sanskrit, Sindhi, and Persian. Copies in these languages often have the generic title of Sant Bhasha.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuru Granth Sahib was composed by the Sikh Gurus: Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Angad Dev, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan Dev,  Guru Tegh Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh added 1 sloakh in mahala 9 Ang 1429. It also contains the traditions and teachings of Indian sants (saints), such as Ravidas,  Ramananda, Kabir and Namdev among others, and two Muslim Sufi saints Bhagat Bhikan and: Sheikh Farid.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vision in the Guru Granth Sahib is of a society based on divine justice without oppression of any kind.[11][12] While the Granth acknowledges and respects the scriptures of Hinduism and Islam, it does not imply a moral reconciliation with either of these religions.[13] It is installed in a Sikh gurdwara (temple); all Sikhs bow or prostrate before it on entering such a temple.[14] The Granth is revered as eternal gurbnؐ and the spiritual authority in Sikhism.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the guruship of Guru Nanak Dev, collections of his holy hymns were compiled and sent to distant Sikh communities for use in morning and evening prayers.[16] His successor Guru Angad Dev began collecting his predecessor's writings. This tradition was continued by the third and fifth gurus as well.\\r\\nWhen the fifth guru Guru Arjan Dev was collecting religious writings of his predecessor, he discovered that pretenders to the guruship were releasing what he considered as forged anthologies of writings of the previous guru and including their own writings with them.[17] In order to prevent spurious scriptures from gaining legitimacy, Guru Arjan Dev began compiling a sacred scripture for the Sikh community. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe finished collecting the religious writings of Guru Ram Das, his immediate predecessor, and convinced Mohan, the son of Guru Amar Das, to give him the collection of the religious writings of the first three gurus.[17] In addition, he sent disciples to go across the country to find and bring back any previously unknown religious writings of theirs. He also invited members of other religions and contemporary religious writers to submit writings for possible inclusion.[17] Guru Arjan pitched a tent by the side of Ramsar tank in Amritsar and started the task of compiling the holy Granth.[18] He selected hymns for inclusion in the Adi Granth and Bhai Gurdas acted as his scribe.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the holy hymns and verses were being put together Akbar, the Mughal Emperor, received a report that the Adi Granth contained passages vilifying Islam. Therefore, while travelling north, he stopped en route and asked to inspect it.[20] Baba Buddha and Bhai Gurdas brought him a copy of the Adi Granth as it existed then. After choosing three random passages to be read, Akbar decided that this report had been false.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1604, Adi Granth was completed and installed at the Harmandir Sahib, with Baba Buddha as the first granthi, or reader.[21][18] Since communities of Sikh disciples were scattered all over northern India, copies of the holy scripture needed to be made for them.[20] The sixth guru added the tunes of 9 out of 22 Vars. Seventh and eighth guru did not have writings of their own added to the holy scripture; however, the ninth guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, did. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, included writings of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur in the Guru Granth Sahib,[20] and included 1 salokh in mahala 9 Ang 1429.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1704 at Damdama Sahib, during a one-year respite from the heavy fighting with Aurangzeb which the Khalsa was engaged in at the time, Guru Gobind Singh and Bhai Mani Singh added the religious compositions of Guru Tegh Bahadur to Adi Granth to create a definitive compilation.[20] Religious verses of Guru Gobind Singh were not included in Guru Granth Sahib, but he added 1 sloak in mahala 9 Ang 1429. His banis are found in the Sri Dasam Granth, they are part in the daily prayers of Sikhs[20] During this period, Bhai Mani Singh also collected Guru Gobind Singh's religious writings, as well as his court poems, and included them in a secondary religious volume, today known as the Dasam Granth Sahib.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nSikhs consider the Guru Granth Sahib as the eternal living guru, the highest religious and spiritual guide for Sikhs and inspire all of humanity; it plays a central role in guiding the Sikh's way of life. Its place in Sikh devotional life is based on two fundamental principles: on the \\"Gurbani\\" (the word of Guru/God) which was received by the Sikh gurus in their divine consciousness from God and revealed to mankind. The Guru Granth Sahib answers all questions regarding religion and that morality can be discovered within it. The word is the guru and the guru is the word. Thus, in Sikh theology, the revealed divine word was written by past gurus. Numerous holy men, aside from the Sikh gurus, are collectively referred to as Bhagats or \\"devotees.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1708 Guru Gobind Singh conferred the title of \\"Guru of the Sikhs\\" upon the Adi Granth. The event was recorded in a Bhatt Vahi (a bard's scroll) by an eyewitness, Narbud Singh,[23] who was a bard at the Rajput rulers' court associated with gurus. A variety of other documents also attest to this proclamation by the tenth guru. Thus, despite some aberrations, Sikhs since then have accepted Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred scripture, as their eternal-living guru, as the embodiment of the ten Sikh Gurus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire Guru Granth Sahib is written in the Gurmukhi script, which was standardized by Guru Angad Dev in the 16th century. According to Sikh tradition and the Mahman Prakash, an early Sikh manuscript, Guru Angad Dev had taught and spread the Gurmukhi script at the suggestion of Guru Nanak Dev which has invented the Gurmukhi script. [24][25] The word Gurmukhؐ translates to \\"from the mouth of the guru\\". It descended from the La?? scripts and was used from the outset for compiling Sikh scriptures. The Sikhs assign a high degree of sanctity to the Gurmukhؐ script.[26] It is the official script for writing Punjabi in the Indian State of Punjab.\\r\\n\\r\\nGurus considered divine worship through shabad kirtan as the best means of attaining that state of bliss -vismad- which resulted in communion with the God. Guru Granth Sahib is divided by musical settings or ragas[27] into 1,430 pages known as Angs (limbs) in Sikh tradition. It can be categorized into two sections:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word raga refers to the \\"color\\"[28] and, more specifically, the emotion or mood produced by a combination or sequence of pitches.[29] A raga is composed of a series of melodic motifs, based upon a definite scale or mode of the seven Swara psalmizations,[30] that provide a basic structure around which the musician performs. Some ragas may be associated with times of the day and year.[27] There are 31 main ragas in the Sikh system, divided into 14 ragas and 17 raginis (minor or less definite ragas), 31 mishrat ragas in 17 taala. Within the raga division, the songs are arranged in order of the Sikh gurus and Sikh bhagats with whom they are associated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ragas are, in order: Sri, Manjh, Gauri, Asa, Gujri, Devagandhari, Bihagara, Wadahans, Sorath, Dhanasri, Jaitsri, Todi, Bairari, Tilang, Suhi, Bilaval, Gond (Gaund), Ramkali, Nut-Narayan, Mali-Gaura, Maru, Tukhari, Kedara, Bhairav (Bhairo), Basant, Sarang, Malar, Kanra, Kalyan, Prabhati and Jaijawanti. In addition there are 22 compositions of Vars (traditional ballads). Nine of these have specific tunes, and the rest can be sung to any tune.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nRagas such as Megh (raga), Hindol (raga)  which were jubilant tone or ragas such as Jog (raga), deepak etc. which were melancholy were not selected for these compositions. [31]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing is a list of contributors whose hymns are present in Guru Granth Sahib:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one can change or alter any of the writings of the Sikh gurus written in the Guru Granth Sahib. This includes sentences, words, structure, grammar, and meanings. Following the example of the gurus themselves, Sikhs observe total sanctity of the holy text of Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Har Rai, for example, disowned one of his sons, Ram Rai, because he had attempted to alter the wording of a hymn by Guru Nanak Dev.[32] Guru Har Rai had sent Ram Rai to Delhi in order to explain Gurbani to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. To please the Emperor he altered the wording of a hymn, which was reported to the guru. Displeased with his son, the guru disowned him and forbade his Sikhs to associate with him or his descendants.\\r\\n\\r\\nA partial English translation of Guru Granth Sahib by Ernest Trumpp was published in 1877. The work was for use by Christian missionaries, and received extremely negative feedback from Sikhs.[33] Max Arthur Macauliffe also partially translated the text for inclusion in his six-volume The Sikh Religion, published by Oxford University Press in 1909. His translations are closer to the Sikhs' own interpretation of the holy scripture, and were received well by them.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first complete English translation of Guru Granth Sahib, by Gopal Singh, was published in 1960. A revised version published in 1978 removed the obsolete English words like \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\". In 1962, an eight-volume translation into English and Punjabi by Manmohan Singh was published by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. In the 2000s, a translation by Sant Singh Khalsa (referred to as the \\"Khalsa Consensus Translation\\") became popular through its inclusion on major Sikhism-related websites.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuru Granth Sahib is always the focal point in any gurudwara, being placed in the centre on a raised platform known as a Takht (throne), while the congregation of devotees sits on the floor and bow before the guru as a sign of respect. Guru Granth Sahib is given the greatest respect and honour. Sikhs cover their heads and remove their shoes while in the presence of this sacred scripture, their eternal living guru. Guru Granth Sahib is normally carried on the head and as a sign of respect, never touched with unwashed hands or put on the floor.[36]\\r\\nIt is attended with all signs of royalty, with a canopy placed over it. A chaur sahib is waved above the Guru Granth Sahib. Peacock-feather fans were waved over royal or saintly beings as a mark of great spiritual or temporal status; this was later replaced by the modern Chaur sahib.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Guru Granth Sahib is taken care of by a Granthi, who is responsible for reciting from the sacred hymns and leading Sikh prayers. The Granthi also acts as caretaker for the Guru Granth Sahib, keeping the Guru Granth Sahib covered in clean cloths, known as rumala, to protect from heat, dust, pollution, etc. The Guru Granth Sahib rests on a manji sahib under a rumala until brought out again.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gurudwara Ramsar, the official religious body of Sikhs, is responsible for making physical copies of the Guru Granth Sahib. Until 1864, the Gurudwara Ramsar allowed only handwritten copies. Now the basement of its headquarters in Amritsar houses the only printing press authorized to reproduce the Guru Granth Sahib. Since the early 20th century, it has been printed in a standard edition of 1430 Angs. The printers, chosen for their skill and uprightness, adhere to a strict code of conduct.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nMisprints, mock-ups, and entire runs and editions, as well as waste with just a single character of the sacred text on it, are incinerated at Goindval.[38] In a process called Agan Bheta, this unused or unpreserved text is burned by itself; no material (such as the typical wood) is added to help \\"cremate\\" it, thus making its burning pure and unadulterated. No handwritten copies are ever destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first CD of the Guru Granth Sahib was released in 2000 by Dr Kulbir Singh Thind which included a full set of Gurbani fonts which he also developed in 1995. [39] In 2000 a British Sikh named Tarsem Singh developed the 'Sikhi to the Max' Guru Granth Sahib search engine which is currently used throughout Sikh diaspora communities around the globe to provide English language translations within Sikh Temples. [40] In 2003 the Panjab Digital Library, in collaboration with the Nanakshahi Trust, began digitizing centuries-old copies and manuscripts of the Guru Granth Sahib and other Sikh sacred texts. In 2004 the Sikher project was launched by Jasdeep Singh Khalsa to develop an 'open source' approach to Gurbani translations and app development. [41] [42] In 2013 the Khalis Foundation a Californian based non-profit relaunched Sikhi to the Max based on the open source philosophy promoted by the Sikher project.

Bicameralism is distinguished from unicameralism, in which all of the members deliberate and vote as a single group, and from some legislatures which have three or more separate assemblies, chambers or houses. As of 2015, somewhat less than half of the world's national legislatures are bicameral.[1]\\r\\nOften, the members of the two chambers are elected or selected using different methods, which vary from country to country. This can often lead to the two chambers having very different compositions of members.\\r\\nEnactment of primary legislation often requires a concurrent majority ÿ the approval of a majority of members in each of the chambers of the legislature. When this is the case, the legislature may be called an example of perfect bicameralism. However, in many Westminster system parliaments, the house to which the executive is responsible can overrule the other house and may be regarded as an example of imperfect bicameralism. Some legislatures lie in between these two positions, with one house only able to overrule the other under certain circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the ideas on which bicameralism are based can be traced back to the theories developed in ancient Sumer, ancient India and later ancient Greece, and Rome, recognizable bicameral institutions first arose in Medieval Europe where it was associated with separate representation of different estates of the realm. For example, one house would represent the aristocracy, and the other would represent the commoners as was the case in the Kingdom of England.[2] Others, such as France under the Ancien Rgime had a tricameral legislature known as the Estates General, which consisted of separate chambers for the clergymen, the nobility and the commoners.[3]\\r\\nThe Founding Fathers of the United States also favoured a bicameral legislature. The idea was to have the Senate be wealthier and wiser. Benjamin Rush saw this though, and noted that, \\"this type of dominion is almost always connected with opulence.\\" The Senate was created to be a stabilising force, elected not by mass electors, but selected by the State legislators. Senators would be more knowledgeable and more deliberatea sort of republican nobilityand a counter to what Madison saw as the \\"fickleness and passion\\" that could absorb the House.[2]\\r\\nHe noted further that the \\"use of the Senate is to consist in its proceeding with more coolness, with more system and with more wisdom, than the popular branch\\". Madison's argument led the Framers to grant the Senate prerogatives in foreign policy, an area where steadiness, discretion, and caution were deemed especially important\\".[2] The Senate was chosen by state legislators, and senators had to possess a significant amount of property in order to be deemed worthy and sensible enough for the position. In fact, it was not until the year 1913 that the 17th Amendment was passed, which \\"mandated that Senators would be elected by popular vote rather than chosen by the State legislatures\\".[2]\\r\\nAs part of the Great Compromise, they invented a new rationale for bicameralism in which the Senate would have states represented equally, and the House would have them represented by population.\\r\\nThe British Parliament is often referred to as the Mother of Parliaments (in fact a misquotation of John Bright, who remarked in 1865 that \\"England is the Mother of Parliaments\\") because the British Parliament has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created many other parliaments.[4] Many nations with parliaments have to some degree emulated the British \\"three-tier\\" model. Most countries in Europe and the Commonwealth have similarly organised parliaments with a largely ceremonial head of state who formally opens and closes parliament, a large elected lower house and a smaller, upper house.[5][6]\\r\\nA formidable sinister interest may always obtain the complete command of a dominant assembly by some chance and for a moment, and it is therefore of great use to have a second chamber of an opposite sort, differently composed, in which that interest in all likelihood will not rule.\\r\\nThere have been a number of rationales put forward in favour of bicameralism, federal states have often adopted it, and the solution remains popular when regional differences or sensitivities require more explicit representation, with the second chamber representing the constituent states. Nevertheless, the older justification for second chambersproviding opportunities for second thoughts about legislationhas survived.[citation needed]\\r\\nGrowing awareness of the complexity of the notion of representation and the multifunctional nature of modern legislatures may be affording incipient new rationales for second chambers, though these do generally remain contested institutions in ways that first chambers are not. An example of political controversy regarding a second chamber has been the debate over the powers of the Canadian Senate or the election of the Senate of France.[7]\\r\\nThe relationship between the two chambers varies; in some cases, they have equal power, while in others, one chamber is clearly superior in its powers. The first tends to be the case in federal systems and those with presidential governments. The latter tends to be the case in unitary states with parliamentary systems.\\r\\nThere are two streams of thought: Critics believe bicameralism makes meaningful political reforms more difficult to achieve and increases the risk of gridlockparticularly in cases where both chambers have similar powerswhile proponents argue the merits of the \\"checks and balances\\" provided by the bicameral model, which they believe help prevent the passage into law of ill-considered legislation.\\r\\nSome countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, Switzerland, Nigeria, and the United States, link their bicameral systems to their federal political structure.\\r\\nIn the United States, Australia, and Mexico, for example, each state is given the same number of seats in one of the houses of the legislature, despite the total population of each state  it is designed to ensure that smaller states are not overshadowed by larger states, which may have more representation in the other house of the legislature.\\r\\nIn Canada, the country as a whole is divided into a number of Senate Divisions, each with a different number of Senators, based on a number of factors. These Divisions are Quebec, Ontario, Western Provinces, and the Maritimes, each with 24 Senators, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, each with 1 Senator, and Newfoundland and Labrador has 6 Senators, making for a total of 105 Senators.\\r\\nSenators in Canada are not elected by the people but are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Senate does not originate most legislation (although a small fraction of government bills are introduced in the Senate and Senators may introduce private members' bills in the same way as MPs) but acts as a chamber of revision almost always passing legislation approved by the House of Commons, made up of Members of Parliament (MPs) who are elected. The Senate must pass legislation before it becomes law and can therefore act as a wise facilitator or engage in filibuster. The Senate does not have to endure the accountability and scrutiny of parliamentary elections. Therefore, the bicameral structure of Canadian parliament is more de jure than de facto.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe bicameral Parliament of Australia consists of two Houses, the lower house is called the House of Representatives and the upper house is named the Senate. The lower house currently consists of 150 members, each elected from single member constituencies, known as electoral divisions (commonly referred to as \\"electorates\\" or \\"seats\\") using full-preference Instant-runoff voting. This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major parties, the Liberal/National Coalition and the Labor Party. The government of the day must achieve the confidence of this House in order to gain and remain in power.\\r\\nThe upper house, the Senate, is also popularly elected under the single transferable vote system of proportional representation. There are a total of 76 senators: 12 senators are elected from each of the six Australian states (regardless of population) and two from each of the two autonomous internal territories (the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory).\\r\\nUnlike upper houses in most Westminster parliamentary systems, the Australian Senate is vested with significant power, including the capacity to block legislation initiated by the government in the House of Representatives, making it a distinctive hybrid of British Westminster bicameralism and US-style bicameralism. As a result of proportional representation, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. The governing party or coalition, which has to maintain the confidence of the lower house, rarely has a majority in the Senate and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and Independents to get legislation passed.[8]\\r\\nIn the German, Indian, and Pakistani systems, the upper houses (the Bundesrat, the Rajya Sabha, and the Senate respectively) are even more closely linked with the federal system, being appointed or elected directly by the governments or legislatures of each Land, State, or Province. (This was also the case in the United States before the 17th Amendment.) Because of this coupling to the executive branch, German legal doctrine does not treat the Bundesrat as the second chamber of a bicameral system formally. Rather, it sees the Bundesrat and the Bundestag as independent constitutional bodies. Only the directly elected Bundestag is considered to be the parliament.[9] In the German Bundesrat, the various L?nder have between three and six votes; thus, while the less populated states have a lower weight, they still have a stronger voting power than would be the case in a system based purely on population, as the most populous Land currently has about 27 times the population of the least populous. The Indian Upper House does not have the states represented equally, but on the basis of their population.\\r\\nThere are also instances of bicameralism in countries that are not federations, but which have upper houses with representation on a territorial basis. For example, in South Africa, the National Council of Provinces (and before 1997, the Senate) has its members chosen by each Province's legislature.\\r\\nIn Spain the Spanish Senate functions as a de facto territorial-based upper house, and there has been some pressure from the Autonomous Communities to reform it into a strictly territorial chamber.\\r\\nThe European Union maintains a bicameral legislative system which consists of the European Parliament, which is elected in general elections on the basis of universal suffrage, and the Council of the European Union which consists of members of the governments of the Member States which are competent for the relevant field of legislation. Although the European Union is not considered a state, it enjoys the power to legislate in many areas of politics; in some areas, those powers are even exclusively reserved to it.\\r\\nIn a few countries, bicameralism involves the juxtaposition of democratic and aristocratic elements.\\r\\nThe best known example is the British House of Lords, which includes a number of hereditary peers. The House of Lords represents a vestige of the aristocratic system which once predominated in British politics, while the other house, the House of Commons, is entirely elected. Over the years, there have been proposals to reform the House of Lords, some of which have been at least partly successful  the House of Lords Act 1999 limited the number of hereditary peers (as opposed to life peers, appointed by Her Majesty on the advice of the Prime Minister ) to 92, down from around 700. Of these 92, one is the Earl Marshal, a hereditary office always held by the Duke of Norfolk, one is the Lord Great Chamberlain, a hereditary office held by turns, currently by the Marquess of Cholmondeley, and the other 90 are elected by all sitting peers. Hereditary peers elected by the House to sit as representative peers sit for life; when a representative peer dies, byelections occur to fill the vacancy. The ability of the House of Lords to block legislation is curtailed by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. Peers can introduce bills except Money Bills, and all legislation must be passed by both Houses of Parliament. If it is not passed within two sessions, the House of Commons can override the Lords delay by invoking the Parliament Act. Certain pieces of legislation however must be approved by both Houses and are not able to be forced through by the Commons under the Parliament Act. This includes any bill which would extend the time length of a Parliament, private bills, bills which are sent to the House of Lords less than one month before the end of a session, and bills which originate in the House of Lords.\\r\\nLife Peers are appointed either by recommendation of the Appointment Commission; the independent body that vets non-partisan peers, typically from academia, business or culture, or by Dissolution Honour, which takes place at the end of every Parliamentary term and leaving MPs may be offered a seat to keep their institutional memory. It is traditional for a peerage to be offered to every outgoing Speaker of the House of Commons.[10]\\r\\nFurther reform of the Lords has been proposed; however, reform is not supported by many. Members of the House of Lords all have an aristocratic title, or are from the Clergy. 26 Archbishops and Bishops of the Church of England sit as Lords Spiritual, being the Archbishop of Canterbury, Archbishop of York, the Bishop of London, the Bishop of Durham, the Bishop of Winchester and the next 21 longest-serving Bishops. It is usual that retiring Archbishops, and certain other Bishops, are appointed to the Crossbenches and given a life peerage. Until 2009, 12 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary sat in the House as the highest court in the land; they subsequently became justices of the newly created Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. At present, 786 people sit in the House of Lords, with 92 Hereditary, 26 being Bishops or Archbishops (the Lords Spiritual) and the rest being Life Peers. Membership is not fixed and decreases only on the death of a life peer.\\r\\nAnother example of aristocratic bicameralism was the Japanese House of Peers, abolished after World War II and replaced with the present House of Councillors.\\r\\nMany bicameral countries like the Netherlands, the Philippines, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Ireland and Romania are examples of bicameral systems existing in unitary states. In countries such as these, the upper house generally focuses on scrutinizing and possibly vetoing the decisions of the lower house.\\r\\nOn the other hand, in Italy the Parliament consists of two chambers that have the same role and power: the Senate (Senate of the Republic, commonly considered the upper house) and the Chamber of Deputies (considered the lower house).\\r\\nIn some of these countries, the upper house is indirectly elected. Members of France's Senate, Ireland's Seanad ireann are chosen by electoral colleges consisting of members of the lower house, local councillors, the Taoiseach, and graduates of selected universities, while the Netherlands' Senate is chosen by members of provincial assemblies (which in turn are directly elected).\\r\\nNorway had a kind of semi-bicameral legislature with two chambers, or departments, within the same elected body, the Storting. These were called the Odelsting and Lagting and were abolished after the general election of 2009. According to Morten S?berg, there was a related system in the 1798 constitution of the Batavian Republic.[11]\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, members of the unicameral Legislative Council returned from the democratically elected geographical constituencies and partially-democratic functional constituencies are required to vote separately since 1997 on motions, bills or amendments to government bills not introduced by the government. The passage of these motions, bills or amendments to government bills requires double majority in both groups simultaneously. (Before 2004, when elections to the Legislative Council from the Election Committee was abolished, members returned through the Election Committee vote with members returned from geographical constituencies.) The double majority requirement does not apply to motions, bills and amendments introduced by the government.\\r\\nIn some countries with federal systems, individual states (like those of the United States, Australia and a few States of India) may also have bicameral legislatures. Only three such states, Nebraska in the US, Queensland in Australia and Bavaria in Germany have later adopted unicameral systems. Brazilian states and Canadian provinces had all their upper houses abolished.\\r\\nIn Argentina, eight provinces have bicameral legislatures, with a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies: Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Corrientes, Entre Ros, Mendoza, Salta, San Luis (since 1987) and Santa Fe. C܇rdoba and Tucumn changed to unicameral systems in 2001 and 2003 respectively.\\r\\nIn Australian states, the lower house was traditionally elected based on the one-vote-one-value principle, whereas the upper house was partially appointed and elected, with a bias towards country voters and landowners. In Queensland, the appointed upper house was abolished in 1922, while in New South Wales there were similar attempts at abolition, before the upper house was reformed in the 1970s to provide for direct election. Nowadays, the upper house both federally and in most states is elected using the Single transferable vote form of proportional representation while the lower house uses Instant-runoff voting in single member electorates. This is reversed in the state of Tasmania, where proportional representation is used for the lower house and single member electorates for the upper house.\\r\\nThe Legislature of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is a bicameral legislative body. It consists of two chambers. The House of Representatives has 98 delegates, elected for four-year terms by proportional representation. The House of Peoples has 58 members, 17 delegates from among each of the constituent peoples of the Federation, and 7 delegates from among the other peoples.[12] Republika Srpska, the other entity, has a unicameral parliament, known as the National Assembly.[13]\\r\\nThe German federal state of Bavaria had a bicameral legislature from 1946 to 1999, when the Senate was abolished by a referendum amending the state's constitution. The other 15 states have used a unicameral system since their founding.\\r\\nSeven Indian States, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Jammu-Kashmir, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, have bicameral Legislatures, these are called legislative councils (Vidhan Parishad), one third of whom are elected every two years, there are graduate constituencies (members elected exclusively by graduates), teachers constituencies (members elected exclusively by teachers), municipal constituencies (members elected exclusively by Mayors and council members of the city Governments). From 1956 to 1958 the Andhra Pradesh Legislature was unicameral. In 1958, when the Legislative Council was formed, it became bicameral until 1 June 1985 when it was abolished. This continued until March 2007 when the Legislative Council was reestablished and elections were held for its seats. Since then the Andhra Pradesh Legislature has become once again bicameral. In Tamil Nadu, a resolution was passed on 14 May 1986 and the Legislative Council was dissolved on 1 Nov 1986. Again on 12 April 2010, a resolution was passed to bring it back bicameral, but became unsuccessful in 2011.\\r\\nUnder Soviet regime regional and local Soviets were unicameral. After the adoption of 1993 Russian Constitution bicameralism was introduced in some regions. Bicameral regional legislatures are still technically allowed by federal law but this clause is dormant now. The last region to switch from bicameralism to unicameralism was Sverdlovsk Oblast in 2012.\\r\\nDuring the 1930s, the Legislature of the State of Nebraska was reduced from bicameral to unicameral with the 43 members that once comprised that state's Senate. One of the arguments used to sell the idea at the time to Nebraska voters was that by adopting a unicameral system, the perceived evils of the \\"conference committee\\" process would be eliminated.\\r\\nA conference committee is appointed when the two chambers cannot agree on the same wording of a proposal, and consists of a small number of legislators from each chamber. This tends to place much power in the hands of only a small number of legislators. Whatever legislation, if any, the conference committee finalizes must then be approved in an unamendable \\"take-it-or-leave-it\\" manner by both chambers.\\r\\nDuring his term as Governor of the State of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura proposed converting the Minnesotan legislature to a single chamber with proportional representation, as a reform that he felt would solve many legislative difficulties and impinge upon legislative corruption. In his book on political issues, Do I Stand Alone?, Ventura argued that bicameral legislatures for provincial and local areas were excessive and unnecessary, and discussed unicameralism as a reform that could address many legislative and budgetary problems for states.\\r\\nA 2005 report on democratic reform in the Arab world by the US Council on Foreign Relations co-sponsored by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Arab states to adopt bicameralism, with upper chambers appointed on a 'specialized basis'. The Council claimed that this would protect against the 'Tyranny of the majority', expressing concerns that without a system of checks and balances extremists would use the single chamber parliaments to restrict the rights of minority groups.\\r\\nIn 2002, Bahrain adopted a bicameral system with an elected lower chamber and an appointed upper house. This led to a boycott of parliamentary elections that year by the Al Wefaq party, who said that the government would use the upper house to veto their plans. Many secular critics of bicameralism were won around to its benefits in 2005, after many MPs in the lower house voted for the introduction of so-called morality police.\\r\\nA referendum on introducing a unicameral Parliament instead of the current bicameral Parliament was held in Romania on 22 November 2009. The turnout rate was 50.95%, with 77.78% of \\"Yes\\" votes for a unicameral Parliament.[14] This referendum had a consultative role, thus requiring a parliamentary initiative and another referendum to ratify the new proposed changes.\\r\\nA referendum on a new constitution will be held on October 30, 2016. The constitution draft would create a bicameral Parliament instead of the current unicameral. The Senate is expected to represent the interests of territorial collectivities and Ivoirians living abroad. Two thirds of the Senate is to be elected at the same time as the general election. The remaining one third is appointed by the president elect.[15]","input":"How many states in india are bicameral in their governance structure?"},{"output":"endosteum","context":"The medullary cavity (medulla, innermost part) is the central cavity of bone shafts where red bone marrow and/or yellow bone marrow (adipose tissue) is stored; hence, the medullary cavity is also known as the marrow cavity.

Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days, starting on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which may occur at any time from late November to late December in the Gregorian calendar. It is also known as the Festival of Lights and the Feast of Dedication.\\r\\nThe festival is observed by lighting the candles of a candelabrum with nine branches, called a Hanukkah menorah (or hanukkiah). One branch is typically placed above or below the others and its candle is used to light the other eight candles. This unique candle is called the shamash (Hebrew: ????, \\"attendant\\"). Each night, one additional candle is lit by the shamash until all eight candles are lit together on the final night of the holiday.[1] Other Hanukkah festivities include playing dreidel and eating oil-based foods such as doughnuts and latkes. Since the 1970s, the worldwide Chabad Hasidic movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"Hanukkah\\" derives from the Hebrew verb \\"???\\", meaning \\"to dedicate\\". On Hanukkah, the Maccabean Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.[3][4] Many homiletical explanations have been given for the name:[5]\\r\\nIn Hebrew, the word Hanukkah is written ????????? or ????? (??nukkh). It is most commonly transliterated to English as Chanukah or Hanukkah, the latter because the sound represented by \\"CH\\" ([], similar to the Scottish pronunciation of \\"loch\\") is not native to the English language. Furthermore, the letter \\"?et\\" (?), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew (voiceless uvular fricative) from in classical Hebrew (voiceless pharyngeal fricative [?]), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is geminate in classical (but not modern) Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal ?eth can lead to the spelling \\"Hanukkah\\"; while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular ?eth leads to the spelling \\"Chanukah\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nThe story of Hanukkah is preserved in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books are not part of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) which came from the Palestinian canon; however, they were part of the Alexandrian canon which is also called the Septuagint (sometimes abbreviated LXX).[8] Both books are included in the Old Testament used by the Catholic and Orthodox Churches,[9] since those churches consider the books deuterocanonical. They are not included in the Old Testament books in most Protestant Bibles since most Protestants consider the books apocryphal. Multiple references to Hanukkah are also made in the Mishna (Bikkurim 1:6, Rosh HaShanah 1:3, Taanit 2:10, Megillah 3:4 and 3:6, Moed Katan 3:9, and Bava Kama 6:6), though specific laws are not described. The miracle of the one-day supply of oil miraculously lasting eight days is first described in the Talmud, committed to writing about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.[10]\\r\\nRav Nissim Gaon postulates in his Hakdamah Le'mafteach Hatalmud that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to explain it. A modern-day scholar Reuvein Margolies suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the Bar Kochba revolt, its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans.[11]\\r\\nThe Gemara (Talmud), in tractate Shabbat, page 21b, focuses on Shabbat candles and moves to Hanukkah candles and says that after the forces of Antiochus IV had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still sealed by the High Priest, with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for eight days (the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready).[12]\\r\\nThe Talmud presents three options:[13]\\r\\nExcept in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside one's door, on the opposite side of the mezuza, or in the window closest to the street. Rashi, in a note to Shabbat 21b, says their purpose is to publicize the miracle. The blessings for Hanukkah lights are discussed in tractate Succah, p.?46a.[14]\\r\\nThe Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus narrates in his book, Jewish Antiquities XII, how the victorious Judas Maccabeus ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.[15] Josephus does not say the festival was called Hanukkah but rather the \\"Festival of Lights\\":\\r\\nThe story of Hanukkah is alluded to in the book of 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees. The eight-day rededication of the temple is described in 1 Maccabees 4:36ÿ4:59, though the name of the festival and the miracle of the lights do not appear here. A story similar in character, and obviously older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees 1:18ÿ1:36 according to which the relighting of the altar fire by Nehemiah was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.[citation needed] The above account in 1 Maccabees 4, as well as 2 Maccabees 1:9 portrays the feast as a delayed observation of the eight-day Feast of Booths (Sukkot)\\"; similarly 2 Maccabees 10:6 explains the length of the feast as \\"in the manner of the Feast of Booths\\".\\r\\nAnother source is the Megillat Antiochus. This work (also known as \\"Megillat Benei ?ashmonai\\", \\"Megillat Hanukkah\\", or \\"Megillat Yevanit\\") is extant in both the Aramaic and Hebrew languages; the Hebrew version is a literal translation from the Aramaic original. Recent scholarship dates it to somewhere between the 2nd and 5th Centuries, probably in the 2nd century,[17] with the Hebrew dating to the 7th century.[18] It was published for the first time in Mantua in 1557. Saadia Gaon, who translated it into Arabic in the 9th century, ascribed it to the elders of the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel.[19] The Hebrew text with an English translation can be found in the Siddur of Philip Birnbaum.\\r\\nThe Scroll of Antiochus concludes with the following words:\\r\\n...After this, the sons of Israel went up to the Temple and rebuilt its gates and purified the Temple from the dead bodies and from the defilement. And they sought after pure olive oil to light the lamps therewith, but could not find any, except one bowl that was sealed with the signet ring of the High Priest from the days of Samuel the prophet and they knew that it was pure. There was in it [enough oil] to light [the lamps therewith] for one day, but the God of heaven whose name dwells there put therein his blessing and they were able to light from it eight days. Therefore, the sons of ?ashmonai made this covenant and took upon themselves a solemn vow, they and the sons of Israel, all of them, to publish amongst the sons of Israel, [to the end] that they might observe these eight days of joy and honour, as the days of the feasts written in [the book of] the Law; [even] to light in them so as to make known to those who come after them that their God wrought for them salvation from heaven. In them, it is not permitted to mourn, neither to decree a fast [on those days], and anyone who has a vow to perform, let him perform it.\\r\\nOriginal language (Aramaic):\\r\\nIn the Christian Greek Scriptures, John 10:22ÿ23 says Jesus walked in Solomon's Porch at the Jerusalem Temple during \\"the Feast of Dedication and it was winter.\\" The Greek term that is used is \\"the renewals\\" (Greek ta enkainia ? ?۰ϫ?ϫ). [21] The Hebrew word for \\"dedication\\" is Hanukkah. The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word Khawdata (a close synonym), which literally means \\"renewal\\" or \\"to make new.\\" [22]Josephus refers to the festival as \\"lights.\\"[23]\\r\\nJudea was part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Panium. Judea then became part of the Seleucid Empire of Syria.[24] King Antiochus III the Great wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects guaranteed their right to \\"live according to their ancestral customs\\" and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem.[25] However, in 175 BCE, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus III, invaded Judea, at the request of the sons of Tobias.[26] The Tobiads, who led the Hellenizing Jewish faction in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest Onias and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them. The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem. As Flavius Josephus relates:\\r\\nThe king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them, and came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by force, and slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolemy, and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months.\\r\\nWhen the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped, Judaism was outlawed. In 167 BCE, Antiochus ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He banned brit milah (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple.[28]\\r\\nAntiochus's actions provoked a large-scale revolt. Mattathias (Mattityahu), a Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan, Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan, and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus. It started with Mattathias killing first, a Jew who wanted to comply with Antiochus's order to sacrifice to Zeus, and then a Greek official who was to enforce the government's behest (1 Mac. 2, 24ÿ25[29]). Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi (\\"Judah the Hammer\\"). By 166 BCE Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 165 BCE the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event.[30] Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made. According to the Talmud, unadulterated and undefiled pure olive oil with the seal of the kohen gadol (high priest) was needed for the menorah in the Temple, which was required to burn throughout the night every night. The story goes that one flask was found with only enough oil to burn for one day, yet it burned for eight days, the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of kosher oil for the menorah. An eight-day festival was declared by the Jewish sages to commemorate this miracle.[31]\\r\\nThe version of the story in 1 Maccabees states that an eight-day celebration of songs and sacrifices was proclaimed upon re-dedication of the altar, and makes no specific mention of the miracle of the oil.[32]\\r\\nSome modern scholars argue that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the Maccabean Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.[33][34][35][36]\\r\\nThese competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus.[37] In particular, Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.[38] Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war.[39]\\r\\nWhat began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews in their conflict with the traditionalists.[40] As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices the traditionalists had rallied around. This may explain why the king, in a total departure from Seleucid practice in all other places and times, banned a traditional religion.[41]\\r\\nThe miracle of the oil is widely regarded as a legend and its authenticity has been questioned since the Middle Ages.[42] However, given the famous question Rabbi Yosef Karo posed concerning why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days when the miracle was only for seven days (since there was enough oil for one day),[43] it was clear that he believed it was a historical event. This belief has been adopted by most of Orthodox Judaism, in as much as Rabbi Karo's Shulchan Aruch is a main Code of Jewish Law.\\r\\nSelected battles between the Maccabees and the Seleucid Syrian-Greeks:\\r\\nHanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the 8-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals.[58]\\r\\nHanukkah is not a \\"Sabbath-like\\" holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath, as specified in the Shulkhan Arukh.[59][60] Adherents go to work as usual but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall. There is no religious reason for schools to be closed, although in Israel schools close from the second day for the whole week of Hanukkah.[61][62] Many families exchange gifts each night, such as books or games, and \\"Hanukkah Gelt\\" is often given to children. Fried foods (such as latkes (potato pancakes), jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot), and Sephardic bimuelos) are eaten to commemorate the importance of oil during the celebration of Hanukkah. Some also have a custom of eating dairy products to remember Judith and how she overcame Holofernes by feeding him cheese, which made him thirsty, and giving him wine to drink. When Holofernes became very drunk, Judith cut off his head.[63]\\r\\nEach night throughout the 8 day holiday, a candle or oil-based light is lit. As a universally practiced \\"beautification\\" (hiddur mitzvah) of the mitzvah, the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.[64] An extra light called a shamash, meaning \\"attendant\\" or \\"sexton,\\"[65] is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others.[66]\\r\\nAmong Ashkenazim the tendency is for every male member of the household (and in many families, girls as well) to light a full set of lights each night,[67][68] while among Sephardim the prevalent custom is to have one set of lights for the entire household.[69]\\r\\nThe purpose of the shamash is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 21bÿ23a), against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah miracle. This differs from Sabbath candles which are meant to be used for illumination and lighting. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the shamash candle would be available, and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some, especially Ashkenazim, light the shamash candle first and then use it to light the others.[70] So altogether, including the shamash, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 (36, excluding the shamash). It is Sephardic custom not to light the shamash first and use it to light the rest. Instead, the shamash candle is the last to be lit, and a different candle or a match is used to light all the candles. Some Hasidic Jews follow this Sephardic custom as well.[71]\\r\\nThe lights can be candles or oil lamps.[70] Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated (an incandescent flashlight would be acceptable for this purpose), while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special candelabrum referred to as either a Chanukiah (the modern Israeli term) or a menorah (the traditional name, simply Hebrew for 'lamp'). Many families use an oil lamp (traditionally filled with olive oil) for Hanukkah. Like the candle Chanukiah, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shamash light.[72]\\r\\nIn the United States, Hanukkah became a more visible festival in the public sphere from the 1970s when Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson called for public awareness and observance of the festival and encouraged the lighting of public menorahs.[73][74][75][76] Diane Ashton attributed the increased visibility and reinvention of Hanukkah by some of the American Jewish community as a way to adapt to American life, re-inventing the festival in \\"the language of individualism and personal conscience derived from both Protestantism and the Enlightenment\\".[77]\\r\\nThe reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the \\"lighting of the house within\\", but rather for the \\"illumination of the house without,\\" so that passersby should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle (i.e. that the sole cruse of pure oil found which held enough oil to burn for one night actually burned for eight nights). Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some Ashkenazi Jews to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most Sephardi Jews light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of antisemitic persecution were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in Persia under the rule of the Zoroastrians, or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most Hasidic groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the mezuzah, so that when one passes through the door s/he is surrounded by the holiness of mitzvot (the commandments).[citation needed]\\r\\nGenerally, women are exempt in Jewish law from time-bound positive commandments, although the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles for they too were involved in the miracle.[78][79]\\r\\nHanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark.[80] The custom of many is to light at sundown, although most Hasidim light later.[80] Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights.[81]\\r\\nInexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour so should be lit no earlier than nightfall.[80] Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on Shabbat itself, the candles must be lit before sunset.[80] However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual,[80] followed by the Shabbat candles. At the end of the Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.[82]\\r\\nIf for whatever reason one didn't light at sunset or nightfall, the lights should be kindled later, as long as there are people in the streets.[80] Later than that, the lights should still be kindled, but the blessings should be recited only if there is at least somebody else awake in the house and present at the lighting of the Hannukah lights.[83]\\r\\nTypically two blessings (brachot; singular: brachah) are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles. On the first night, the shehecheyanu blessing is added, making a total of three blessings.[84]\\r\\nThe blessings are said before or after the candles are lit depending on tradition. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle or oil) is lit on the right side of the menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first but it is lit first, and so on, proceeding from placing candles right to left but lighting them from left to right over the eight nights.[85]\\r\\n[86]???????? ?????? ?', ??-???????? ?????? ????????, ?????? ??????????? ?????????????, ?????????? ?????????? ??? ????????.?\\r\\nTransliteration:?Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner shel Hanukkah.\\r\\nTranslation: \\"Blessed are You, LORD?our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Hanukkah light[s].\\"\\r\\n[86]???????? ?????? ?' ??-???????? ?????? ????????, ????????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????????? ????? ????????? ??????.?\\r\\nTransliteration:?Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, she'asa nisim la'avoteinu ba'yamim ha'heim ba'z'man ha'ze.\\r\\nTranslation: \\"Blessed are You, LORD?our God, King of the universe, Who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days at this time...\\"\\r\\nAfter the lights are kindled the hymn Hanerot Halalu is recited. There are several different versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:[87]\\r\\nIn the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, and praises God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory), and a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over Rome.[88]\\r\\nThe song was composed in the thirteenth century by a poet only known through the acrostic found in the first letters of the original five stanzas of the song: Mordechai. The familiar tune is most probably a derivation of a German Protestant church hymn or a popular folk song.[89]\\r\\nAfter lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Some Hasidic and Sephardi Jews recite Psalms, such as Psalms 30, Psalms 67, and Psalms 91. In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give tzedakah (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves.[90][91]\\r\\nAn addition is made to the \\"hoda'ah\\" (thanksgiving) benediction in the Amidah (thrice-daily prayers), called Al ha-Nissim (\\"On/about the Miracles\\").[93] This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.[94][95]\\r\\nThe same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) (Psalms 113 ÿ Psalms 118) are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential prayers are omitted.[94][96]\\r\\nThe Torah is read every day in the shacharit morning services in synagogue, on the first day beginning from Numbers 6:22 (according to some customs, Numbers 7:1), and the last day ending with Numbers 8:4. Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two, Jewish Sabbaths (Saturdays). The weekly Torah portion for the first Sabbath is almost always Miketz, telling of Joseph's dream and his enslavement in Egypt. The Haftarah reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is Zechariah 2:14 ÿ Zechariah 4:7. When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the Haftarah reading is from 1Kings 7:40 ÿ 1Kings 7:50.\\r\\nThe Hanukkah menorah is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings.[97]\\r\\nThe menorah is not lit during Shabbat, but rather prior to the beginning of Shabbat as described above and not at all during the day. During the Middle Ages \\"Megillat Antiochus\\" was read in the Italian synagogues on Hanukkah just as the Book of Esther is read on Purim. It still forms part of the liturgy of the Yemenite Jews.[18]\\r\\nThe last day of Hanukkah is known by some as Zot Hanukkah and by others as Chanukat HaMizbeach, from the verse read on this day in the synagogue Numbers 7:84, Zot Hanukkat Hamizbe'ach: \\"This was the dedication of the altar\\". According to the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism, this day is the final \\"seal\\" of the High Holiday season of Yom Kippur and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other Gmar chatimah tovah (\\"may you be sealed totally for good\\"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.[98]\\r\\nIt is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles' burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning. It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah.[99]\\r\\nA large number of songs have been written on Hanukkah themes, perhaps more so than for any other Jewish holiday. Some of the best known are \\"Ma'oz Tzur\\" (Rock of Ages), \\"Latke'le Latke'le\\" (Yiddish song about cooking Latkes), \\"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\\" (\\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\\"), \\"Ocho Kandelikas\\" (\\"Eight Little Candles\\"), \\"Kad Katan\\" (\\"A Small Jug\\"), \\"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\\" (\\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\\"), \\"Haneirot Halolu\\" (\\"These Candles which we light\\"), \\"Mi Yimalel\\" (\\"Who can Retell\\") and \\"Ner Li, Ner Li\\" (\\"I have a Candle\\"). Among the most well known songs in English-speaking countries are \\"Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel\\"[100] and \\"Oh Chanukah\\".[101]\\r\\nAmong the Rebbes of the Nadvorna Hasidic dynasty, it is customary for the Rebbes to play violin after the menorah is lit.[102]\\r\\nPenina Moise's Hannukah Hymn published in the 1842 Hymns Written for the Use of Hebrew Congregations was instrumental in the beginning of Americanization of Hanukkah.[77][103][104]\\r\\nThere is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably olive oil) to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the Second Temple's Menorah alight for eight days.[105] Traditional foods include potato pancakes, known as latkes in Yiddish, especially among Ashkenazi families. Sephardi, Polish, and Israeli families eat jam-filled doughnuts (Yiddish: ????????? pontshkes), bimuelos (fritters) and sufganiyot which are deep-fried in oil. Hungarian Jews eat cheese pancakes known as \\"cheese latkes\\".[106]\\r\\nLatkes are not popular in Israel, having been largely replaced by sufganiyot due to local economic factors, convenience and the influence of trade unions.[107] Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for sufganiyot besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, caramel, cappuccino and others.[108] In recent years, downsized, \\"mini\\" sufganiyot containing half the calories of the regular, 400-to-600-calorie version, have become popular.[109]\\r\\nRabbinic literature also records a tradition of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah.[110] This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also played an important role in the events of Hanukkah.[111] The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.[112]\\r\\nRoast goose has historically been a traditional Hanukkah food among Eastern European and American Jews, although the custom has declined in recent decades.[113]\\r\\nAfter lighting the candles, it is customary to play (or spin) the dreidel. The dreidel, or sevivon in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter which is an abbreviation for the Hebrew words ?? ???? ??? ?? (Nes Gadol Haya Sham, \\"A great miracle happened there\\"), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the Beit Hamikdash. On dreidels sold in Israel, the fourth side is inscribed with the letter ? (Pe), rendering the acronym ?? ???? ??? ?? (Nes Gadol Haya Po, \\"A great miracle happened here\\"), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel, although this is a relatively recent innovation. Stores in Haredi neighborhoods sell the traditional Shin dreidels as well, because they understand \\"there\\" to refer to the Temple and not the entire Land of Israel, and because the Hasidic Masters ascribe significance to the traditional letters.[114][115]\\r\\nChanukkah gelt (Yiddish for \\"Chanukkah money\\") known in Israel by the Hebrew translation dmei Hanukkah, is often distributed to children during the festival of Hanukkah. The giving of Hanukkah gelt also adds to the holiday excitement. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums. The tradition of giving Chanukah gelt dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude. One minhag favors the fifth night of Hanukkah for giving Hanukkah gelt.[116] Unlike the other nights of Hanukkah, the fifth does not ever fall on the Shabbat, hence never conflicting with the Halachic injunction against handling money on the Shabbat.[117]\\r\\nThe United States has a history of recognizing and celebrating Hanukkah in a number of ways. The earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion presented United States President Harry Truman with a Hanukkah Menorah. In 1979 president Jimmy Carter took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the National Menorah held across the White House lawn. In 1989, President George H.W. Bush displayed a menorah in the White House. In 1993, President Bill Clinton invited a group of schoolchildren to the Oval Office for a small ceremony.[118]\\r\\nThe United States Postal Service has released several Hanukkah-themed postage stamps. In 1996 the United States Postal Service (USPS) issued a 32 cent Hanukkah stamp as a joint issue with Israel.[119] In 2004 after 8 years of reissuing the menorah design, the USPS issued a dreidel design for the Hanukkah stamp. The dreidel design was used through 2008. In 2009 a Hanukkah stamp was issued with a design featured a photograph of a menorah with nine lit candles.[120]\\r\\nIn 2001, President George W. Bush held an official Hanukkah reception in the White House in conjunction with the candle-lighting ceremony, and since then this ceremony has become an annual tradition attended by Jewish leaders from around the country.[121] In 2008, George Bush linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting the candles.[122]\\r\\nIn December 2014, two Hanukkah celebrations were held at the White House. The White House commissioned a menorah made by students at the Max Rayne school in Israel and invited two of its students to join U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as they welcomed over 500 guests to the celebration. The students' school in Israel had been subjected to arson by extremists. President Obama said these \\"students teach us an important lesson for this time in our history. The light of hope must outlast the fires of hate. Thats what the Hanukkah story teaches us. Its what our young people can teach us that one act of faith can make a miracle, that love is stronger than hate, that peace can triumph over conflict.[123] Rabbi Angela Warnick Buchdahl, in leading prayers at the ceremony commented on the how special the scene was, asking the President if he believed America's founding fathers could possibly have pictured that a female Asian-American rabbi would one day be at the White House leading Jewish prayers in front of the African-American president.[124]\\r\\nThe dates of Hanukkah are determined by the Hebrew calendar. Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of Kislev and concludes on the 2nd or 3rd day of Tevet (Kislev can have 29 or 30 days). The Jewish day begins at sunset. Hanukkah begins at sunset of the date listed.\\r\\nIn 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of Thanksgiving fell during Hanukkah for only the third time since Thanksgiving was declared a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. The last time was 1899; and due to the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly out of sync with each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future.[125] This convergence prompted the creation of the portmanteau neologism Thanksgivukkah.[126][127][128]\\r\\nMajor Jewish holidays are those when all forms of work are forbidden, and that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc. Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the Hebrew Bible was completed. Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile.[129]\\r\\nSome Jewish historians suggest a different explanation for the rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism. First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Romes grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, like the CE 135 experience.[130]\\r\\nWith the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, however, these themes were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the national and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.[131][132]\\r\\nIn North America especially, Hanukkah gained increased importance with many Jewish families in the latter part of the 20th century, including among large numbers of secular Jews, who wanted a Jewish alternative to the Christmas celebrations that often overlap with Hanukkah. Though it was traditional among Ashkenazi Jews to give \\"gelt\\" or money to children during Hanukkah, in many families this has been supplemented with other gifts so that Jewish children can enjoy gifts just as their Christmas-celebrating peers do.[133]\\r\\nWhile Hanukkah is a relatively minor Jewish holiday, as indicated by the lack of religious restrictions on work other than a few minutes after lighting the candles, in North America, Hanukkah in the 21st century has taken a place equal to Passover as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.[134]\\r\\nSome Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkah's \\"miracle of the oil\\", emphasizing reflection on energy conservation and energy independence. An example of this is the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life's renewable energy campaign.[135][136][137]\\r\\nAn entire room of Paris's Museum of Jewish Art and History is dedicated to Hanukkah, through an exceptional collection of Hanukkiyot, in a variety of shapes and designs, origins and periods.

It was also placed sixth in the 2016 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.[3] The book has been translated into French, German, Spanish and Italian as Le gant enfoui, Der begrabene Riese, El gigante enterrado and Il gigante sepolto respectively.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Buried Giant took ten years to write, longer than Ishiguro had anticipated. Speaking at the Cheltenham Book Festival in 2014, he said his wife, Lorna MacDougall, had rejected an early draft of the book, saying \\"this won't do ... there's no way you can carry on with this, you'll have to start again from the beginning\\".[4] Ishiguro added that, at the time, he had been surprised by her comments because he had been pleased with his progress so far.[4] He shelved the novel and wrote a short story collection, Nocturnes (2009).[2] It was six years before Ishiguro returned to The Buried Giant, and, following his wife's advice, he proceeded to \\"start from scratch and rebuild it from the beginning\\".[2][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIshiguro's inspiration for The Buried Giant came from the 14th-century Arthurian chivalric romance, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. He had wanted to write about collective memory and the way societies cope with traumatic events by forgetting. He ruled out modern historic settings because they would be too realistic and interpreted too literally. The poem about Sir Gawain solved Ishiguro's problem: \\"this kind of barren, weird England, with no civilization ... could be quite interesting\\".[2] He proceeded to research life in England around that time, and discovered, \\"[t]o my delight ... nobody knows what the hell was going on. It's a blank period of British history\\".[2] Ishiguro filled in the blanks himself and this led to the novel's fantasy setting. For the book's title, he sought his wife's help. But after many discarded ideas they found it near the end of the novel's text. Ishiguro explained, \\"The giant well buried is now beginning to stir. And when it wakes up, there's going to be mayhem\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the death of King Arthur, Saxons and Britons live in relative harmony. Axl and Beatrice, an elderly Briton couple, notice that everyone living in the region seems to suffer from amnesia. They decide to travel to a village several days away to see their son, whom they barely remember. During their first night of travel, the couple stays at a Saxon village, only to discover that two ogres had attacked some of the villagers and dragged off a boy named Edwin. A visiting Saxon warrior, Wistan, agrees to kill the ogres and rescue Edwin, but the latter is discovered to have a wound, believed to be an ogre-bite. The Saxons, owing to superstition, attempt to kill Edwin, but Wistan rescues him and joins Axl and Beatrice on their journey, hoping to leave Edwin at the son's village. The group heads toward a monastery to consult with Jonus, a wise monk, about Beatrice's illness. On the way, they meet the elderly Sir Gawain, nephew of King Arthur, who was tasked decades ago with slaying the she-dragon Querig, but never succeeded. A Briton soldier sent by Lord Brennus attempts to kill Wistan and Edwin, but Wistan kills him. Sir Gawain, who considers Lord Brennus corrupt, offers to conceal the soldier's death. Wistan reveals that he was sent by the Saxon king to slay Querig out of concern that Querig would be tamed by Lord Brennus and employed to kill Saxons. The four travelers are treated with hospitality at the monastery, but are informed by Jonus that most of the monks are corrupt. Sir Gawain speaks to the abbot, believing he will protect the four. Instead, the abbot informs Lord Brennus, who sends thirty soldiers to have them murdered. Axl, Beatrice, and Edwin are thrown into a tunnel with a doglike monster, but are rescued by Sir Gawain. Meanwhile, Wistan kills the soldiers using traps. Axl and Beatrice, as they continue their journey, pass by Querig's lair, and are persuaded by a girl to bring a poisoned goat to the entrance, in the hope that Querig will die from eating the goat.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Gawain, riding alone, recalls how King Arthur had ordered the extermination of entire villages of Saxon women and children. The massacre was a betrayal of the peace-treaties brokered by Axl, who was the king's envoy. King Arthur also ordered Sir Gawain, Merlin, and a few others to maim Querig and to cast a spell turning her breath into an oblivion-inducing mist, with the result that Saxons would forget about the massacres. Wistan and Edwin arrive at Querig's lair. Sir Gawain reveals that his duty was not to slay Querig, but to protect her. Wistan challenges Sir Gawain to a duel and kills him. He proceeds to slay Querig, causing the amnesia of all people to dissipate, and their memories to return, setting the stage for another war. In the final chapter, Axl and Beatrice recall that their son, who ran away from home, died during the black plague. A ferryman offers to take the couple to the island where their son is buried. The island supposedly has a curse which causes those who set foot to forget about the existence of other humans and to perpetually wander within the island's confines. However, the ferryman informs them that they qualify for a special dispensation where, if a couple's love is profound and genuine, their relationship will not be broken upon entering the island. That said, the boat can only transport one person at a time, so the ferryman must transport Beatrice first while Axl waits. Axl reluctantly accepts the decision, with the nagging suspicion that the ferryman has tricked them into separating forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Buried Giant received generally positive reviews from critics.[5] Not all critics praised the novel, however.[6] James Wood writing for The New Yorker criticized the work, saying that \\"Ishiguro is always breaking his own rules, and fudging limited but conveniently lucid recollections.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish author and journalist Alex Preston was much more positive in The Guardian, writing:[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nFocusing on one single reading of its story of mists and monsters, swords and sorcery, reduces it to mere parable; it is much more than that.

The Buried Giant is Game of Thrones with a conscience, The Sword in the Stone for the age of the trauma industry, a beautiful, heartbreaking book about the duty to remember and the urge to forget.\\r\\nIn 2015, Random House Audio released an audiobook version of the novel, read by David Horovitch.","input":"Who is the author of the buried giant?"},{"output":"that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home","context":"District of Columbia v.

It also stated that the right to bear arms is not unlimited and that guns and gun ownership would continue to be regulated.

Emerson, 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 2001), which supported the right and Silveira v. Lockyer, 312 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir. 2002), which opposed the right. The Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939) was interpreted to support both sides of the issue.\\r\\nIn February 2003, the six residents of Washington, D.C. filed a lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the constitutionality of provisions of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, a local law (part of the District of Columbia Code) enacted pursuant to District of Columbia home rule. This law restricted residents from owning handguns, excluding those grandfathered in by registration prior to 1975 and those possessed by active and retired law enforcement officers. The law also required that all firearms including rifles and shotguns be kept \\"unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock.\\"[17] They filed for an injunction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.??2201, 2202, and 42 U.S.C.??1983. District Court Judge Ricardo M. Urbina dismissed the lawsuit.\\r\\nOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the dismissal in a 2ÿ1 decision. The Court of Appeals struck down provisions of the Firearms Control Regulations Act as unconstitutional. Judges Karen L. Henderson, Thomas B. Griffith and Laurence H. Silberman formed the Court of Appeals panel, with Senior Circuit Judge Silberman writing the court's opinion and Circuit Judge Henderson dissenting.\\r\\nThe court's opinion first addressed whether appellants have standing to sue for declaratory and injunctive relief in section II (slip op. at 5ÿ12). The court concluded that of the six plaintiffs, only Heller ÿ who applied for a handgun permit but was denied ÿ had standing.\\r\\nThe court then held that the Second Amendment \\"protects an individual right to keep and bear arms\\", that the \\"right existed prior to the formation of the new government under the Constitution\\", also stating that the right was \\"premised on the private use of arms for activities such as hunting and self-defense, the latter being understood as resistance to either private lawlessness or the depredations of a tyrannical government (or a threat from abroad).\\" They also noted that though the right to bear arms also helped preserve the citizen militia, \\"the activities [the Amendment] protects are not limited to militia service, nor is an individual's enjoyment of the right contingent upon his or her continued or intermittent enrollment in the militia.\\" The court determined that handguns are \\"Arms\\" and concluded that thus they may not be banned by the District of Columbia.\\r\\nThe court also struck down the portion of the law that requires all firearms including rifles and shotguns be kept \\"unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock.\\" The District argued that there is an implicit self-defense exception to these provisions, but the D.C. Circuit rejected this view, saying that the requirement amounted to a complete ban on functional firearms and prohibition on use for self-defense:[18]\\r\\nSection 7-2507.02, like the bar on carrying a pistol within the home, amounts to a complete prohibition on the lawful use of handguns for self-defense. As such, we hold it unconstitutional.\\r\\nIn her dissent, Circuit Judge Henderson stated that Second Amendment rights did not extend to residents of Washington D.C., writing:\\r\\nTo sum up, there is no dispute that the Constitution, case law and applicable statutes all establish that the District is not a State within the meaning of the Second Amendment. Under United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. at 178, the Second Amendment's declaration and guarantee that \\"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\\" relates to the Militia of the States only. That the Second Amendment does not apply to the District, then, is, to me, an unavoidable conclusion.[19]\\r\\nIn April 2007, the District and Mayor Adrian Fenty petitioned for rehearing en banc, arguing that the ruling created inter- and intra-jurisdictional conflict.[20] On May 8, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied the request to rehear the case, by a 6ÿ4 vote.\\r\\nThe defendants petitioned the United States Supreme Court to hear the case. The plaintiffs did not oppose but, in fact, welcomed the petition. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on November 20, 2007.[21] The court rephrased the question to be decided as follows:\\r\\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari is granted limited to the following question: Whether the following provisions, D.C. Code ҡ 7-2502.02(a)(4), 22ÿ4504(a), and 7-2507.02, violate the Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any state-regulated militia, but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes?\\r\\nThis represented the first time since the 1939 case United States v. Miller that the Supreme Court had directly addressed the scope of the Second Amendment.[17]\\r\\nBecause of the controversial nature of the case, it garnered much attention from many groups on both sides of the gun rights issue. Many of those groups filed amicus curiae (friend of the court) briefs, about 47 urging the court to affirm the case and about 20 to remand it.[22]\\r\\nA majority of the members of Congress[23] signed the brief authored by Stephen Halbrook advising that the case be affirmed overturning the ban on handguns not otherwise restricted by Congress.[24] Vice President Dick Cheney joined in this brief, acting in his role as President of the United States Senate, and breaking with the George W. Bush administration's official position.[23] Arizona Senator John McCain, Republican, also signed the brief. Then-Illinois Senator Barack Obama, did not.[25]\\r\\nA majority of the states signed the brief of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, authored by Abbott's solicitor general, Ted Cruz,[26] advising that the case be affirmed, while at the same time emphasizing that the states have a strong interest in maintaining each of the states' laws prohibiting and regulating firearms.[27][28][29] Law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the Southern States Police Benevolent Association, also filed a brief urging that the case be affirmed.[30]\\r\\nA number of organizations signed friend of the court briefs advising that the case be remanded, including the United States Department of Justice[31] and Attorneys General of New York, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico.[32] Additionally, friend of the court briefs to remand were filed by a spectrum of religious and anti-violence groups,[33] a number of cities and mayors,[34] and many police chiefs and law enforcement organizations.[35]\\r\\nA collection of organizations and prominent scholars, represented by attorney Jeffrey Teichert, submitted an \\"errors brief\\" arguing that many of the common historical and factual \\"myths and misrepresentations\\" generally offered in favor of banning handguns were in error. Teichert's errors brief argued from a historical perspective that the Second Amendment protected an individual right to keep and bear arms.[dead link][36]\\r\\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case on March 18, 2008. Both the transcript[37] and the audio[38] of the argument have been released. Each side was initially allotted 30 minutes to argue its case, with U.S. Solicitor General Paul D. Clement allotted 15 minutes to present the federal government's views.[39] During the argument, however, extra time was extended to the parties, and the argument ran 23 minutes over the allotted time.[40]\\r\\nWalter E. Dellinger of the law firm O'Melveny & Myers, also a professor at Duke University Law School and former Acting Solicitor General, argued the District's side before the Supreme Court. Dellinger was assisted by Thomas Goldstein of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, Robert Long of Covington & Burling and D.C. Solicitor General Todd Kim. The law firms assisting the District worked pro bono.[41]\\r\\nAlan Gura, of the D.C.-based law firm Gura & Possessky, was lead counsel for Heller, and argued on his behalf before the Supreme Court.[42] Robert Levy, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, and Clark Neily, a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, were his co-counsel.[43][44]\\r\\nThe Supreme Court held:[45]\\r\\nThe Opinion of the Court, delivered by Justice Scalia, was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. and by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.[46]\\r\\nThe Illinois Supreme Court in People v. Aguilar (2013), summed up the Heller's findings and reasoning:\\r\\nIn District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court undertook its first-ever \\"in-depth examination\\" of the second amendment's meaning Id. at 635. After a lengthy historical discussion, the Court ultimately concluded that the second amendment \\"guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation\\" (id. at 592); that \\"central to\\" this right is \\"the inherent right of self-defense\\"(id. at 628); that \\"the home\\" is \\"where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute\\" (id. at 628); and that, \\"above all other interests,\\" the second amendment elevates \\"the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home\\" (id. at 635). Based on this understanding, the Court held that a District of Columbia law banning handgun possession in the home violated the second amendment. Id. at 635.[47]\\r\\nThe core holding in D.C. v. Heller is that the Second Amendment is an individual right intimately tied to the natural right of self-defense.\\r\\nThe Scalia majority invokes much historical material to support its finding that the right to keep and bear arms belongs to individuals; more precisely, Scalia asserts in the Court's opinion that the \\"people\\" to whom the Second Amendment right is accorded are the same \\"people\\" who enjoy First and Fourth Amendment protection: \\"'The Constitution was written to be understood by the voters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished from technical meaning.' United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 731 (1931); see also Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 188 (1824). Normal meaning may of course include an idiomatic meaning, but it excludes secret or technical meanings....\\"\\r\\nWith that finding as anchor, the Court ruled a total ban on operative handguns in the home is unconstitutional, as the ban runs afoul of both the self-defense purpose of the Second Amendment ÿ a purpose not previously articulated by the Court ÿ and the \\"in common use at the time\\" prong of the Miller decision: since handguns are in common use, their ownership is protected.\\r\\nThe Court applies as remedy that \\"[a]ssuming that Heller is not disqualified from the exercise of Second Amendment rights, the District must permit him to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.\\" The Court, additionally, hinted that other remedy might be available in the form of eliminating the license requirement for carry in the home, but that no such relief had been requested: \\"Respondent conceded at oral argument that he does not 'have a problem with ... licensing' and that the District's law is permissible so long as it is 'not enforced in an arbitrary and capricious manner.' Tr. of Oral Arg. 74ÿ75. We therefore assume that petitioners' issuance of a license will satisfy respondents prayer for relief and do not address the licensing requirement.\\"\\r\\nIn regard to the scope of the right, the Court wrote, in an obiter dictum, \\"Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\\"[48]\\r\\nThe Court also added dicta regarding the private ownership of machine guns. In doing so, it suggested the elevation of the \\"in common use at the time\\" prong of the Miller decision, which by itself protects handguns, over the first prong (protecting arms that \\"have some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\\"), which may not by itself protect machine guns: \\"It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service ÿ M16 rifles and the like ÿ may be banned, then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause. But as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendments ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home.\\"[49]\\r\\nThe Court did not address which level of judicial review should be used by lower courts in deciding future cases claiming infringement of the right to keep and bear arms: \\"[S]ince this case represents this Courts first in-depth examination of the Second Amendment, one should not expect it to clarify the entire field.\\" The Court states, \\"If all that was required to overcome the right to keep and bear arms was a rational basis, the Second Amendment would be redundant with the separate constitutional prohibitions on irrational laws, and would have no effect.\\"[50] Also, regarding Justice Breyer's proposal of a \\"judge-empowering 'interest-balancing inquiry,'\\" the Court states, \\"We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding 'interest-balancing' approach.\\"[51]\\r\\nIn a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens stated that the court's judgment was \\"a strained and unpersuasive reading\\" which overturned longstanding precedent, and that the court had \\"bestowed a dramatic upheaval in the law\\".[52] Stevens also stated that the amendment was notable for the \\"omission of any statement of purpose related to the right to use firearms for hunting or personal self-defense\\" which was present in the Declarations of Rights of Pennsylvania and Vermont.[52]\\r\\nThe Stevens dissent seems to rest on four main points of disagreement: that the Founders would have made the individual right aspect of the Second Amendment express if that was what was intended; that the \\"militia\\" preamble and exact phrase \\"to keep and bear arms\\" demands the conclusion that the Second Amendment touches on state militia service only; that many lower courts' later \\"collective-right\\" reading of the Miller decision constitutes stare decisis, which may only be overturned at great peril; and that the Court has not considered gun-control laws (e.g., the National Firearms Act) unconstitutional. The dissent concludes, \\"The Court would have us believe that over 200 years ago, the Framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons.... I could not possibly conclude that the Framers made such a choice.\\"\\r\\nJustice Stevens' dissent was joined by Justices David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer.\\r\\nJustice Breyer filed a separate dissenting opinion, joined by the same dissenting Justices, which sought to demonstrate that, starting from the premise of an individual-rights view, the District of Columbia's handgun ban and trigger lock requirement would nevertheless be permissible limitations on the right.\\r\\nThe Breyer dissent looks to early municipal fire-safety laws that forbade the storage of gunpowder (and in Boston the carrying of loaded arms into certain buildings), and on nuisance laws providing fines or loss of firearm for imprudent usage, as demonstrating the Second Amendment has been understood to have no impact on the regulation of civilian firearms. The dissent argues the public safety necessity of gun-control laws, quoting that \\"guns were responsible for 69 deaths in this country each day.'\\"\\r\\nWith these two supports, the Breyer dissent goes on to conclude, \\"there simply is no untouchable constitutional right guaranteed by the Second Amendment to keep loaded handguns in the house in crime-ridden urban areas.\\" It proposes that firearms laws be reviewed by balancing the interests (i.e., \\"'interest-balancing' approach\\") of Second Amendment protections against the government's compelling interest of preventing crime.\\r\\nThe Breyer dissent also objected to the \\"common use\\" distinction used by the majority to distinguish handguns from machineguns: \\"But what sense does this approach make? According to the majoritys reasoning, if Congress and the States lift restrictions on the possession and use of machineguns, and people buy machineguns to protect their homes, the Court will have to reverse course and find that the Second Amendment does, in fact, protect the individual self-defense-related right to possess a machine-gun...There is no basis for believing that the Framers intended such circular reasoning.\\"[53]\\r\\nAttorney Alan Gura, in a 2003 filing, used the term \\"sham litigation\\" to describe the NRA's attempts to have Parker (aka Heller) consolidated with its own case challenging the D.C. law. Gura also stated that \\"the NRA was adamant about not wanting the Supreme Court to hear the case\\".[54] These concerns were based on NRA lawyers' assessment that the justices at the time the case was filed might reach an unfavorable decision.[55] Cato Institute senior fellow Robert Levy, co-counsel to the Parker plaintiffs, has stated that the Parker plaintiffs \\"faced repeated attempts by the NRA to derail the litigation.\\"[56] He also stated that \\"The N.R.A.s interference in this process set us back and almost killed the case. It was a very acrimonious relationship.\\"[6]\\r\\nWayne LaPierre, the NRA's chief executive officer, confirmed the NRA's misgivings. \\"There was a real dispute on our side among the constitutional scholars about whether there was a majority of justices on the Supreme Court who would support the Constitution as written,\\" Mr. LaPierre said.[6] Both Levy and LaPierre said the NRA and Mr. Levy's team were now on good terms.[6]\\r\\nElaine McArdle wrote in the Harvard Law Bulletin: \\"If Parker is the long-awaited \\"clean\\" case, one reason may be that proponents of the individual-rights view of the Second Amendment ÿ including the National Rifle Association, which filed an amicus brief in the case ÿ have learned from earlier defeats, and crafted strategies to maximize the chances of Supreme Court review.\\" The NRA did eventually support the litigation by filing an amicus brief with the Court arguing that the plaintiffs in Parker had standing to sue and that the D.C. ban was unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.[57]\\r\\nChris Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, had indicated support of federal legislation which would repeal the D.C. gun ban. Opponents of the legislation argued that this would have rendered the Parker case moot, and would have effectively eliminated the possibility that the case would be heard by the Supreme Court.[58]\\r\\nImmediately after the Supreme Court's ruling, the NRA filed a lawsuit against the city of Chicago over its handgun ban, followed the next day by a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco over its ban of handguns in public housing.[59]\\r\\nThe Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence opposed the arguments made by the plaintiffs in Parker, and filed amicus curiae against those arguments in both the District and Circuit courts.\\r\\nPaul Helmke, the president of the Brady Campaign, suggested to D.C. before the Court granted certiorari that it modify its gun laws rather than appeal to the Supreme Court.[60] Helmke has written that if the Supreme Court upholds the Circuit court ruling, it \\"could lead to all current and proposed firearms laws being called into question.\\"[61]\\r\\nAfter the ruling, Paul Helmke stated that, \\"the classic 'slippery slope' argument\\", \\"that even modest gun control would lead down the path to a complete ban on gun ownership\\", \\"is now gone.\\" Helmke added that, \\"The Court also rejected the absolutist misreading of the Second Amendment that some use to argue 'any gun, any time for anyone,' which many politicians have used as an excuse to do nothing about the scourge of gun violence in our country and to block passage of common sense gun laws.\\"[62]\\r\\nVarious experts expressed opinions on the D.C. Circuit's decision.\\r\\nHarvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe contended that the Second Amendment protects an individual right, and predicted that if Parker is reviewed by the Supreme Court \\"there's a really quite decent chance that it will be affirmed.\\"[57] However, Professor Tribe has also argued that the District's ban on one class of weapons does not violate the Second Amendment even under an individual rights view.[63]\\r\\nErwin Chemerinsky, then of Duke Law School and now dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, argued that the District of Columbia's handgun laws, even assuming an \\"individual rights\\" interpretation of the Second Amendment, could be justified as reasonable regulations and thus upheld as constitutional. Professor Chemerinsky believes that the regulation of guns should be analyzed in the same way \\"as other regulation of property under modern constitutional law\\" and \\"be allowed so long as it is rationally related to achieving a legitimate government purpose.\\"[64] However, the dicta in Heller suggests that applying a mere rational basis analysis is an incorrect reading of the Constitution and would, in fact, defeat the entire purpose of the Second Amendment.[50]\\r\\nCato Institute senior fellow Robert Levy, co-counsel to the Parker plaintiffs, agreed with the court's ruling but describes that his interpretation of the Second Amendment would not preclude all governmental regulation of private ownership of weapons:\\r\\nEven the NRA concedes that you cant have mad men running around with weapons of mass destruction. So there are some restrictions that are permissible and it will be the task of the legislature and the courts to ferret all of that out and draw the lines. I am sure, though, that outright bans on handguns like they have in D.C. won't be permitted. That is not a reasonable restriction under anybodys characterization. It is not a restriction, its a prohibition.[65]\\r\\nClark Neily, an attorney for Dick Heller in this case, has said regarding Heller:\\r\\nAmerica went over 200 years without knowing whether a key provision of the Bill of Rights actually meant anything. We came within one vote of being told that it did not, notwithstanding what amounts to a national consensus that the Second Amendment means what it says: The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Taking rights seriously, including rights we might not favor personally, is good medicine for the body politic, and Heller was an excellent dose.[66]\\r\\nRichard Posner, judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, compares Heller to Roe v. Wade, stating that it created a federal constitutional right that did not previously exist, and he asserts that the originalist method ÿ to which Justice Antonin Scalia claimed to adhere ÿ would have yielded the opposite result of the majority opinion.\\r\\nThe text of the amendment, whether viewed alone or in light of the concerns that actuated its adoption, creates no right to the private possession of guns for hunting or other sport, or for the defense of person or property. It is doubtful that the amendment could even be thought to require that members of state militias be allowed to keep weapons in their homes, since that would reduce the militias' effectiveness. Suppose part of a state's militia was engaged in combat and needed additional weaponry. Would the militia's commander have to collect the weapons from the homes of militiamen who had not been mobilized, as opposed to obtaining them from a storage facility? Since the purpose of the Second Amendment, judging from its language and background, was to assure the effectiveness of state militias, an interpretation that undermined their effectiveness by preventing states from making efficient arrangements for the storage and distribution of military weapons would not make sense.[67]\\r\\nJ. Harvie Wilkinson III, chief judge of United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, consents to Posner's analysis, stating that Heller \\"encourages Americans to do what conservative jurists warned for years they should not do: bypass the ballot and seek to press their political agenda in the courts.\\"[68]\\r\\nHeller thus represents the worst of missed opportunitiesthe chance to ground conservative jurisprudence in enduring and consistent principles of restraint. The Constitution expresses the need for judicial restraint in many different waysseparation of powers, federalism, and the grant of life tenure to unelected judges among them. It is an irony that Heller would in the name of originalism abandon insights so central to the Framers designs.[68]\\r\\nAlan Gura, Lead Counsel for Respondent in Heller rejects Wilkinson's criticism, stating that \\"Rather, the Court affirmed the Second Amendment's original public meaning, as confirmed by its plain text. Having determined the Amendment's meaning, the Court showed the proper level of deference to the D.C. City Council's outright repudiation of the constitutional text: none.\\"[69]\\r\\nSince the June 2008 ruling, over 80 different cases have been heard in lower federal courts on the constitutionality of a wide variety of gun control laws.[70][71] These courts have heard lawsuits in regard to bans of firearm possession by felons, drug addicts, illegal aliens, and individuals convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors.[70][71] Also, cases have been heard on the constitutionality of laws prohibiting certain types of weapons, such as machine guns, sawed-off shotguns and/or specific types of weapons attachments. In addition, courts have heard challenges to laws barring guns in post offices and near schools and laws outlawing \\"straw\\" purchases, carrying of concealed weapons, types of ammunition and possession of unregistered firearms.[70][71]\\r\\nThe courts have upheld most of these laws as being constitutional.[71] The basis for the lower court rulings is the paragraph near the end of the Heller ruling that states:\\r\\nNothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions on the commercial sale of arms.[72]\\r\\nConsistently since the Heller ruling, the lower federal courts have ruled that almost all gun control measures as presently legislated are lawful and that according to UCLA professor of constitutional law Adam Winkler: \\"What gun rights advocates are discovering is that the vast majority of gun control laws fit within these categories.\\"[70]\\r\\nRobert Levy, the executive director of the Cato Institute who funded the Heller litigation has commented on this passage describing constitutionally acceptable forms of prohibitions of firearms: \\"I would have preferred that that not have been there,\\" and that this paragraph in Scalia's opinion \\"created more confusion than light.\\"[70]\\r\\nSimilar to the lifting of gun bans mentioned previously in the settlements of lawsuits filed post-Heller, in US v. Arzberger, also decided post-Heller, it was noted:\\r\\nTo the extent, then, that the Second Amendment creates an individual right to possess a firearm unrelated to any military purpose, it also establishes a protectible liberty interest. And, although the Supreme Court has indicated that this privilege may be withdrawn from some groups of persons such as convicted felons, there is no basis for categorically depriving persons who are merely accused of certain crimes of the right to legal possession of a firearm.[73]\\r\\nThe D.C. government indicated it would continue to use zoning ordinances to prevent firearms dealers from operating and selling to citizens residing in the District, meaning it would continue to be difficult for residents to legally purchase guns in the District.[74] Additionally, the District enacted new firearms restrictions in an effort to cure the constitutional defects in the ordinance that the Supreme Court had identified in Heller. The new provisions were: (1) the firearms registration procedures; (2) the prohibition on assault weapons; and (3) the prohibition on large capacity ammunition feeding devices. In response, Dick Heller challenged these new restrictions filing a civil suit named Heller v. District of Columbia (Civil Action No. 08-1289 (RMU), No. 23., 25) where he requested a summary judgment to vacate the new prohibitions. On March 26, 2010, the D.C. District Judge Ricardo M. Urbina denied Dick Heller's request and granted the cross motion, stating that the court \\"concludes that the regulatory provisions that the plaintiffs challenge permissibly regulate the exercise of the core Second Amendment right to use arms for the purpose of self-defense in the home. \\"[75]\\r\\nDick Heller's application to register his semi-automatic pistol was rejected because the gun was a bottom-loading weapon, and according to the District's interpretation, all bottom-loading guns, including magazine-fed non-assault-style rifles, are outlawed because they are grouped with machine guns.[76] Revolvers will likely not fall under such a ban.[77]\\r\\nOn December 16, 2008 the D.C. Council unanimously passed the Firearms Registration Emergency Amendment Act of 2008[78] which addresses the issues raised in the Heller Supreme Court decision, and also puts in place a number of registration requirements to update and strengthen the District's gun laws.[79]\\r\\nJustice Antonin Scalia's opinion for the majority provided Second Amendment protection for commonly used and popular handguns but not for atypical arms or arms used for unlawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns. Scalia stated: \\"Whatever the reason, handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid.\\" \\"We think that Millers ordinary military equipment language must be read in tandem with what comes after: [O]rdinarily when called for [militia] service [able-bodied] men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time. 307 U. S., at 179.\\" \\"We therefore read Miller to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns.\\" \\"It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service ÿ M-16 rifles and the like ÿ may be banned, then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause. But as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendments ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty.\\"[80]\\r\\nOn July 24, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled, in Palmer v. District of Columbia, that the District's total ban on the public carrying of ready-to-use handguns is unconstitutional.[81][82] In its decision, the Court stated: \\"[ . . . ] the Court finds that the District of Columbia's complete ban on the carrying of handguns in public is unconstitutional. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and enjoins Defendants from enforcing the home limitations of D.C. Code  7-2502.02(a)(4) and enforcing D.C. Code  22-4504(a) unless and until such time as the District of Columbia adopts a licensing mechanism consistent with constitutional standards enabling people to exercise their Second Amendment right to bear arms. Furthermore, this injunction prohibits the District from completely banning the carrying of handguns in public for self-defense by otherwise qualified non-residents based solely on the fact that they are not residents of the District.\\"[83]\\r\\nMayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg said that \\"all of the laws on the books in New York State and New York City\\" would be allowed by the ruling as \\"reasonable regulation.\\"[84] Robert Levy has stated that the current New York City gun laws are \\"not much different\\" from the D.C. ban that has been overturned.[85] The National Rifle Association and other gun-rights advocates have not ruled out suing New York City, especially over the definition of \\"reasonable regulation\\".[86]\\r\\nSouthern District of New York Magistrate Judge James Francis has said that, prior to Heller, it would not have been considered unreasonable to require a defendant to surrender a firearm as a condition of pretrial release. Specifically, according to Judge Francis:[87]\\r\\nThis all changed, with the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller; 128 S.Ct. 2783 (2008), where the court changed the course of Second Amendment jurisprudence by creating what he said was a \\"protectible liberty interest\\" in the possession of firearms. Thus, in the absence of an individualized determination at a bail hearing, requiring the defendant to give up any firearms violates due process.\\r\\nMaloney v. Rice (a.k.a. Maloney v. Cuomo and Maloney v. Spitzer), 554 F.3d 56 (2d. Cir. 2009) originally held that the 2nd Amendment does not apply to the states in the Second Circuit. The case involved a state ban on Nunchaku sticks (a martial arts weapon) in New York. In a memorandum opinion dated June 29, 2010, the Supreme Court vacated the Second Circuit decision in Maloney and remanded for further consideration in light of the holding in McDonald v. City of Chicago that the Second Amendment does apply to the states. The Second Circuit has remanded the case to the trial court.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe NRA has filed five related lawsuits since the Heller decision.[88] In four Illinois lawsuits, the NRA sought to have the Second Amendment incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, causing the Second Amendment to apply to state and local jurisdictions and not just to the federal government.[89] Three Illinois lawsuits have been negotiated and settled out of court involving agreements that repeal gun ban ordinances and did not result in incorporation of the Second Amendment to state and local jurisdictions. The fourth NRA lawsuit against Chicago was rejected.[90] The NRA appealed the case to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. On June 2, 2009, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision, based on the theory that Heller applied only to the Federal Government (including the District of Columbia), and not to states or their subordinate jurisdictions.[citation needed] This opinion directly conflicts with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals's earlier decision, holding that Heller applies to states as well.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit's decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago and remanded it back to Seventh Circuit to resolve conflicts between certain Chicago gun restrictions and the Second Amendment. Chicago's handgun law was likened to the D.C. handgun ban by Justice Breyer.[91]\\r\\nSimilarly, three Illinois municipalities with gun control measures on the books that previously had banned all handguns have rescinded their handgun bans.[92][93][94][95] These cities were Morton Grove, Illinois,[96] Wilmette, another Illinois village,[97] and Evanston, Illinois which enacted a partial repeal of its handgun ban.\\r\\nIn Ezell v. Chicago,[98] decided July 6, 2011, the Seventh Circuit reversed a district court decision that the post-McDonald measures adopted by the City of Chicago were constitutional. The Chicago law required firearms training in a shooting range in order to obtain a gun permit, but also banned shooting ranges within the City of Chicago. The City had argued that applicants could obtain their training at gun ranges in the suburbs. The opinion noted that Chicago could not infringe Second Amendment rights on the grounds that they could be exercised elsewhere, any more than it could infringe the right to freedom of speech on the grounds that citizens could speak elsewhere.\\r\\nOn January 14, 2009, in Guy Montag Doe v. San Francisco Housing Authority, the San Francisco Housing Authority reached a settlement out of court with the NRA, which allows residents to possess legal firearms within a SFHA apartment building. The San Francisco lawsuit resulted in the elimination of the gun ban from the SF Housing Authority residential lease terms. Tim Larsen speaking for the Housing Authority said that they never intended to enforce its 2005 housing lease gun ban against law-abiding gun owners and have never done so.[99]\\r\\nOn February 13, 2014, in Peruta v. San Diego, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided that the San Diego policy to disallow both concealed carry, and the State of California law that disallows open carry anywhere in the state, were not acceptable under Supreme Court precedent in Heller and McDonald. A \\"responsible, law-abiding citizen has a right under the Second Amendment to carry a firearm in public for self-defense.\\" More specifically, \\"the Second Amendment does require that the states permit some form of carry for self-defense outside the home.\\"(italics in original) ... and \\"carrying weapons in public for the lawful purpose of self defense is a central component of the right to bear arms.\\"[100] The case was remanded to the district court because \\"San Diego Countys 'good cause' permitting requirement impermissibly infringes on the Second Amendment right to bear arms in lawful self-defense.\\"[100]\\r\\nOn January 10, 2014, in Morris v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the District Court struck down a Corps of Engineers regulation barring possession of loaded guns in recreation areas surrounding Corps dams. The court held that tents are akin to homes, and under Heller, Second Amendment rights are protected.[101]\\r\\nInitial reaction has deemed the Heller ruling to be of great significance, though it remains too soon to tell what the long-term effects may be.[102] Sanford Levinson has written that he is inclined to believe that the Heller decision will be relatively insignificant to the practice of law in the long run but that it will have significance to other groups interested in cultural literacy and constitutional designers.[102]\\r\\nIn 2009, both Levinson and Mark Tushnet speculated that it is quite unlikely that the case would be studied as part of casebooks of future law schools.[102] As was predicted,[103] a large surge of court cases was seen in lower federal courts in the aftermath of the 2008 ruling. As of March?2009[update], over 80 cases had been filed seeking to overturn existing gun laws.[104][needs update]\\r\\nThe decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago, which was brought in response to Heller and decided in 2010, did invalidate much of Chicago's gun purchase and registration laws, and has called into question many other state and local laws restricting purchase, possession and carry of firearms.","input":"What was the ruling in district of columbia v. heller?"},{"output":"the difference between the enclosed volume of the outer sphere and the enclosed volume of the inner sphere","context":"In geometry, a spherical shell is a generalization of an annulus to three dimensions.

As of 2011, the United States Census Bureau estimates the Mount Dora population at 12,534.[5] It is part of the Orlando-Kissimmee, FL, Metropolitan Statistical Area. Founded in 1880, Mount Dora is known for its small town charm. It has many antique shops in the downtown area. The downtown area overlooks Lake Dora. Mount Dora is home to one of three freshwater lighthouses in Florida. It hosts many monthly festivals and is known as the \\"Festival City.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe town of Mount Dora began in 1874 when the area was settled by David Simpson, his wife, and two children.[6] In 1880, Ross C. Tremain became the town's first postmaster, and later a major real estate developer for the area. [7] A post office called Mount Dora has been in operation since 1883.[8] Tremain named the unincorporated village Royellou, after his children, Roy, Ella, and Louis.[7]\\r\\nThe community was later named for Dora Ann Drawdy, who was an early settler of the town in the mid-1880s. In 1846, the surveyors named Lake Dora after her, and in 1883 the town was renamed after the lake.[9] The Mount in Mount Dora reflects the fact that the town is on a plateau 184 feet above sea level.[9] In addition to this, Dora is memorialized through Dora Drawdy Way, an alleyway located in the downtown area.\\r\\nThe town became a popular winter retreat for hunters, fishermen, and boaters, and in 1883 the Alexander House, a two-story hotel, was opened. The Alexander House has been renamed several times and was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. A railroad came to town in 1887, followed by an orange packing house, fertilizer factories, and a cannery were established as well. The town was granted a charter in 1910 with John Philip Donnelly as its first mayor; the town had 371 residents at the time.[9]\\r\\nIn the 1920s, Mount Dora began to grow significantly, both in residential development and business development. Mount Dora began investing in public infrastructure, including streetlights, a water system, curbs, and paved roads.[9] The first two public parks were created and the Mount Dora Community Building was built largely from funds raised by Mount Dora residents. The building has since served as the city's performance and meeting venue.\\r\\nFear of the Cold War was on the minds of many Mount Dora resident. One wealthy individual decided to construct a fallout shelter. With contributions from about twenty-five other families, the underground shelter known as \\"The Catacombs\\" was built. It could support 100 people for six months and contained an air conditioner and dehumidifier, as well as food and supplies.[10] The catacombs remain today, but the location is still a secret, and is now in poor condition.\\r\\nThe following are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:\\r\\nThe Mount Dora Historic District is a U.S. historic district in downtown Mount Dora. The district is roughly bounded by 3rd Avenue, 11th Avenue, Clayton Street, and Helen Street.

Overlooking lakes Dora, Gertrude and Beauclair, Mount Dora is situated on a plateau 184 feet (56 m) above sea level. Despite the name, there is no mountain nearby.[13]\\r\\nMount Dora is home to several different museums.\\r\\nThe Mount Dora History Museum, which is the project of the Mount Dora Historical Society. This museum is the location of the first fire station and city jail, which opened in 1923. The exhibits highlight activities in Mount Dora from the 1880s to the 1930s.[14] The museum is located near Donnelly Park.\\r\\nModernism Museum Mount Dora opened in 2013 and is located on East Fourth Avenue.

It was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak.[1][2] Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus,[3] for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary.[4] It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California.[5]\\r\\nProduction was discontinued on September 30, 1977, after the June 10, 1977, introduction of its successor, the Apple II, which Byte magazine referred to as part of the \\"1977 Trinity\\" of personal computing (along with the PET 2001 and the TRS-80).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 5, 1975, Steve Wozniak attended the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club in Gordon French's garage. He was so inspired that he immediately set to work on what would become the Apple I computer.[7] After building it for himself and showing it at the Club, he and Steve Jobs gave out schematics (technical designs) for the computer to interested club members and even helped some of them build and test out copies. Then, Steve Jobs suggested that they design and sell a single etched and silkscreened circuit boardjust the bare board, no electronic partsthat people could use to build the computers. Wozniak calculated that having the board design laid out would cost $1,000 and manufacturing would cost another $20 per board; he hoped to recoup his costs if 50 people bought the boards for $40 each. To fund this small venture, their first company, Jobs sold his van and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator. Very soon after, Steve Jobs arranged to sell \\"something like 50\\" completely built computers to the Byte Shop (a computer store in Mountain View, California) at $500 each. To fulfill the $25,000 order, they obtained $20,000 in parts at 30 days net and delivered the finished product in 10 days.[8]\\r\\nThe Apple I went on sale in July 1976 at a price of US$666.66,[9] because Wozniak \\"liked repeating digits\\" and because of a one-third markup on the $500 wholesale price.[10]\\r\\nThe first unit produced was used in a high school math class, and donated to Liza Loop's public access computer center.[11] About 200 units were produced and all but 25 were sold during nine or ten months.[8]\\r\\nThe Apple I's built-in computer terminal circuitry was distinctive. All one needed was a keyboard and a television set. Competing machines such as the Altair 8800 generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red LEDs, most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a teletypewriter machine. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977, the price was dropped to $475.[12] It continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the Apple II in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year.[13] In October 1977, the Apple I was officially discontinued and removed from Apple's price list.[14] As Wozniak was the only person who could answer most customer support questions about the computer, the company offered Apple I owners discounts and trade-ins for Apple IIs to persuade them to return their computers.[15] These recovered boards were then destroyed by Apple, contributing to their rarity today.[16]\\r\\nAs of 2013, at least 63 Apple I computers have been confirmed to exist. Only six have been verified to be in working condition.\\r\\nBoth Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak have stated that Apple did not assign serial numbers to the Apple l. Several boards have been found with numbered stickers affixed to them, which appear to be inspection stickers from the PCB manufacturer/assembler. A batch of boards is known to have numbers hand-written in black permanent marker on the back; these usually appear as \\"01-00##\\" and anecdotal evidence suggests they are inventory control numbers added by the Byte Shop to the batch Apple sold them. These Byte Shop numbers have often erroneously been described as serial numbers by auction houses and in related press coverage.[42]\\r\\nSeveral Apple I clones and replicas have been released in recent years. These are all created by hobbyists and marketed to the hobbyist/collector community.

First produced on October 20, 1927, but not sold until December 2, it replaced the venerable Model T, which had been produced for 18 years. This new Model A (a previous model had used the name in 1903ÿ04) was designated a 1928 model and was available in four standard colors.\\r\\nBy 4 February 1929, one million Model As had been sold, and by 24 July, two million.[3] The range of body styles ran from the Tudor at US$500 (in grey, green, or black)[3] to the Town Car with a dual cowl at US$1200.[4] In March 1930, Model A sales hit three million, and there were nine body styles available.[3]\\r\\nModel A production ended in March, 1932, after 4,858,644 had been made in all body styles.[5] Its successor was the Model B, which featured an updated 4-cylinder engine, as well as the Model 18, which introduced Ford's new flathead (sidevalve) V8 engine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrices for the Model A ranged from US$385 for a roadster to US$1400 for the top-of-the-line Town Car. The engine was a water-cooled L-head inline 4-cylinder with a displacement of 201?cu?in (3.3?l).[6] This engine provided 40?hp (30?kW; 41?PS).[6] Top speed was around 65?mph (105?km/h). The Model A had a 103.5?in (2,630?mm) wheelbase with a final drive ratio of 3.77:1. The transmission was a conventional 3-speed sliding gear manual unsynchronized unit[6] with a single speed reverse. The Model A had 4-wheel mechanical drum brakes.[6] The 1930 and 1931 models were available with stainless steel radiator cowling and headlamp housings.\\r\\nThe Model A came in a wide variety of styles including a Coupe (Standard and Deluxe), the Business Coupe, Sport Coupe, Roadster Coupe (Standard and Deluxe), Convertible Cabriolet, Convertible Sedan, Phaeton (Standard and Deluxe), Tudor Sedan (Standard and Deluxe), Town Car, Fordor (2-window) (Standard and Deluxe), Fordor (3-window) (Standard and Deluxe), Victoria, Town Sedan, Station Wagon, Taxicab, Truck, and Commercial.[citation needed] The very rare Special Coupe started production around March 1928 and ended mid-1929.\\r\\nThe Model A was the first Ford to use the standard set of driver controls with conventional clutch and brake pedals, throttle, and gearshift. Previous Fords used controls that had become uncommon to drivers of other makes. The Model A's fuel tank was situated in the cowl, between the engine compartment's fire wall and the dash panel. It had a visual fuel gauge, and the fuel flowed to the carburetor by gravity. A rear-view mirror was optional.[1] In cooler climates, owners could purchase an aftermarket cast iron unit to place over the exhaust manifold to provide heat to the cab. A small door provided adjustment of the amount of hot air entering the cab. The Model A was the first car to have safety glass in the windshield.[7]\\r\\nThe Soviet company GAZ, which started as a joint venture between Ford and the Soviet Union, made a licensed version 1932ÿ1936.[8] This served as the basis for the FAI and BA-20 armored cars which saw use as Soviet scout vehicles in the early stages of World War II.\\r\\nIn addition to the United States, Ford made the Model A in plants in Argentina, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.\\r\\nIn Europe, where in some countries cars were taxed according to engine size, Ford in the UK manufactured the Model A with a smaller displacement engine of 2043 cc providing a claimed output of 28?hp (21?kW; 28?PS).[9] However, the engine equated to a British fiscal horsepower of 14.9?hp (11.1?kW; 15.1?PS)[10] (compared to the 24?hp (18?kW; 24?PS) of the larger engine) and attracted a punitive annual car tax levy of S1 per fiscal hp in the UK . It therefore was expensive to own and too heavy and thirsty to achieve volume sales, and so unable to compete in the newly developing mass market, while also too crude to compete as a luxury product. European manufactured Model A's failed to achieve the sales success in Europe that would greet their smaller successor in England and Germany.[11]\\r\\nFrom the mid 1910s through the early 1920s, Ford dominated the automotive market with its Model T. However, during the mid-1920s, this dominance eroded as competitors, especially the various General Motors divisions, caught up with Ford's mass production system and began to outcompete Ford in some areas, especially by offering more powerful engines, new convenience features, or cosmetic customization.[12][13][14] Also, features Henry Ford considered to be unnecessary, such as electric starters, were gradually shifting in the public's perception from luxuries to essentials.\\r\\nFord's sales force recognized the threat and advised Henry to respond to it. Initially he resisted, but the T's sagging market share finally forced him to admit a replacement was needed. When he finally agreed to begin development of this new model, he focused on the mechanical aspects and on what today is called design for manufacturability (DFM), which he had always strongly embraced and for which the Model T production system was famous. Although ultimately successful, the development of the Model A included many problems that had to be resolved.[15] For example, the die stamping of parts from sheet steel, which the Ford company had led to new heights of development with the Model T production system, was something Henry had always been ambivalent about; it had brought success, but he felt that it was not the best choice for durability. He was determined that the Model A would rely more on drop forgings than the Model T; but his ideas to improve the DFM of forging did not prove practical. Eventually, Ford's engineers persuaded him to relent, lest the Model A's production cost force up its retail price too much.[16]\\r\\nHenry's disdain for cosmetic vanity as applied to automobiles led him to leave the Model A's styling to a team led by his son Edsel, even though he would take credit for it despite his son doing more of the work.\\r\\nIt was during the period from the mid-1920s to early 1930s that the limits of the first generation of mass production, epitomized by the Model T production system's rigidity, became apparent. The era of \\"flexible mass production\\" had begun.[17][18]\\r\\nThe Model A was well represented in media of the era since it was one of the most common cars.

Approximately five miles from the entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park, the Stanley offers panoramic views of Lake Estes, the Rockies and especially Long's Peak. It was built by Freelan Oscar Stanley of Stanley Steamer fame and opened on July 4, 1909, catering to the American upper class at the turn of the century.[2] The hotel and its surrounding structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stanley Hotel hosted the horror novelist Stephen King, serving as inspiration for the Overlook Hotel in his 1977 bestseller The Shining and its 1980 film adaption of the same name, as well as the location for the 1997 miniseries. Today, it includes a restaurant, spa, and bed-and-breakfast, and provides guided tours which feature the history and alleged paranormal activity of the site.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1903, the Yankee steam-powered car inventor  Freelan Oscar Stanley (1849-1940) was stricken with a life-threatening resurgence of tuberculosis.[3] The most highly recommended treatment of the day was fresh, dry air with lots of sunlight and a hearty diet. Therefore, like many \\"lungers\\" of his day, Stanley resolved to take the curative air of Rocky Mountain Colorado. He and Flora arrived in Denver in March and, in June, decided to spend the rest of the summer in the mountains, in Estes Park. Over the course of the season, Stanley's health improved dramatically.[2] Impressed by the beauty of the valley and grateful for his recovery, he decided to return every year. He lived to the ripe age of 91, dying of a heart attack in Newton, Massachusetts, one year after his wife, in 1940.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1907, Stanley had recovered completely. However, not content with the rustic accommodations, lazy pastimes and relaxed social scene of their new summer home, Stanley resolved to turn Estes Park into a resort town. In 1907, construction began on the Hotel Stanley, a 48-room grand hotel that catered to the class of wealthy urbanites who composed the Stanleys' social circle back east.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land was officially purchased in 1908 through the representatives of Lord Dunraven, the Anglo-Irish peer who had originally acquired it by stretching the provisions of the Homestead Act and pre-emption rights. Between 1872 and 1884, Dunraven claimed 15,000 acres (61?km2) of the Estes Valley in an unsuccessful attempt to create a private hunting preserve, making him one of the largest foreign holders of American lands. Unpopular with the local ranchers and farmers, Dunraven left the area for the last time in 1884 relegating the ranch to the management of an overseer.[2][3] Dunraven's presence in Colorado had become so well known in the United States that his situation was parodied in Charles King's novel Dunraven Ranch (1892) as well as James A. Michener's Centennial (1974). His reputation was such that, when Stanley suggested \\"The Dunraven\\" as a name for his new hotel, 180 people signed a buckskin petition requesting that he name it for himself instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe structure was completed in 1909 and featured a hydraulic elevator, dual electric and gas lighting, running water, a telephone in every guest room and a fleet of specially-designed Stanley \\"Model Z\\" Mountain Wagons to bring guests from the train depot twenty miles away; all of this at a time when Estes Park was little more than a locale for hunters and naturalists. Originally, Stanley chose an ocher color for the hotel's exterior with white accents and trim. The hotel was not equipped with heat until 1983 and closed for the winter every year. The presence of the hotel and Stanley's own involvement greatly contributed to the growth of Estes Park (incorporated in 1917) and the creation of the Rocky Mountain National Park (established in 1915).\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley operated the hotel almost as a pastime remarking once that he spent more money than he made each summer. In 1926, he sold the Stanley to a private company incorporated for the sole purpose of running it. The venture failed and, in 1929, Stanley purchased his property out of foreclosure selling it again, in 1930, to fellow auto and hotel magnate Roe Emery of Denver. During Emery's tenure as owner, the structures were painted white inside and out and most of the original electro-gas fixtures were replaced.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 2008\\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 2011\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth elevation\\r\\n\\r\\nLobby looking east\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic room looking south\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stanley Hotel National Register Historic District contains eleven contributing buildings including the main hotel, a concert hall, carriage house and The Lodge, a smaller bed-and-breakfast originally called Stanley Manor. The buildings were designed by F.O. Stanley with the professional assistance of Denver architect T. Robert Wieger, Henry \\"Lord Cornwallis\\" Rogers, and contractor Frank Kirchoff. The site was chosen for its vantage overlooking the Estes valley and Long's Peak within the National Park. The main building is a steel-frame structure with wood cladding resting upon a granite masonry foundation. Wood for flooring, clapboarding and finishing was brought from Kirchoff's Denver Lumberyard and the Bluff City Lumber Company of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The Griffith sawmill near Bierstadt Lake and Stanley's own Hidden Valley lumber operation, located in the future national park, supplied framing material. The materials were brought to Lyons, Colorado by rail and thence to Estes Park by mule-drawn wagon. Simultaneously, Stanley oversaw the construction of a hydroelectric power plant which brought electricity to Estes Park for the first time in 1909. Stanley claimed that his hotel was the first to be powered entirely by electricity from the lighting to the kitchens. Water was supplied by the Black Canyon Creek which was dammed in 1906.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe style of the campus is so-called Colonial Revival. Although rare in the western United States, F.O. Stanley chose the Colonial Revival for its fashionable popularity in New England where he had already designed his own home and a social club in the style. The hotel's clientele would presumably, like the Stanleys, have identified the style with New England respectability and sophistication in contrast to the rusticity of the surrounding town. At one time, Stanley planned to build another, more economical hotel in Estes Park as well as a headquarters and residence for the superintendent of the Rocky Mountain National Park in the same style, to harmonize with his grand hotel. While the forms and layouts of the buildings are suited to their modern uses, their ornamentation exhibits the stylistic hallmarks of Georgian or Federal architecture from the staunch symmetry of the south elevation to the cupola, dormers, Palladian windows, side- and fan-lights, scroll brackets and \\"swan's neck\\" pediments that articulate the exterior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe floor plan of the main hotel building was laid out to accommodate the various activities popular with the American upper class at the turn of the twentieth century and the spaces are decorated accordingly. The music room, for instance, with its cream-colored walls (originally green and white), large windows and fine, classical plaster-work was designed for letter-writing during the day and chamber music at night - cultured pursuits perceived as feminine. On the other hand, the smoking lounge (today the Pi?on Room) and adjoining billiard room, with their dark stained-wood elements and granite fireplace were designated for enjoyment by male guests. Stanley himself, having been raised in a Protestant household in the tee-totaling State of Maine and having recovered from a serious lung disease, did not smoke cigars or drink alcohol, but these were essential after-dinner activities for most men at the time. Billiards, however, was among Stanley's most cherished pastimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe layout was also determined by air circulation. The window at the top of the grand stair provides a pleasant breeze across the lobby, French doors in the state rooms open onto shaded verandas and the two curving staircases connecting the guest corridors prevent stagnant air in the upper floors. Although the hotel was finally updated with central heating in 1983, guests still depend on Rocky Mountain breezes for cooling in the summer. Also completed in 1983, the hotel's service tunnel connects the basement level to the staff entrance. It is cut directly through the granite on which the hotel sits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concert hall, east of the hotel, was built by Stanley in 1909 with the assistance of Henry \\"Lord Cornwallis\\" Rogers, the same architect who designed his summer cottage. According to popular legend, it was built as a gift for Flora Stanley who was an avid pianist despite her failing eyesight. The interior is decorated in the same manner as the smaller music room and somewhat resembles that of the Boston Symphony Hall (McKim, Mead & White, 1900) with which the Stanleys may have been familiar. The stage features a trap door, used for theatrical entrances and exits. The lower level once housed a bowling alley. This feature has long since disappeared but it possibly resembled the one at the Stanley's Hunnewell Club in Newton, pictures of which are archived in the Newton Free Library. The hall underwent extensive repair and renovation in the 2000s.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce called Stanley Manor, this smaller hotel between the main structure and the concert hall is a 2:3 scaled-down version of the main hotel. Unlike its model, the manor was fully heated from completion in 1910 which may indicate that Stanley planned to use it as a winter resort when the main building was closed for the season. However, unlike many other Colorado mountain towns now famous for their winter sports, Estes Park never attracted off-season visitors in Stanley's day and the manor remained empty for much of the year. Today it is called The Lodge and serves as a bed-and-breakfast off-limits to the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, the open area in front of the hotel, originally a driveway for Stanley Steamers and a promenade for guests to enjoy mountain views, was  replaced with a hedge maze. This non-historic feature was added to evoke the hotel's connection to The Shining. Although a hedge maze features prominently in Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining, no such feature can be found in Stephen King's novel. The lawn of the Overlook Hotel, as King imagined it, was adorned with topiary animals and it was set that way for the shooting of the miniseries in 1996. Historically, neither feature existed at the Stanley. The design was the result of a competition, chosen from amongst 300 entrants from across the globe. The winning submission was designed by New York architect Mairim Dallaryan Standing.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, John Cullen, owner of the Stanley Hotel, announced a competition for a sculpture to be the centerpiece of the terrace in front of the hotel.  Sculptors Sutton Betti and Daniel Glanz won the competition with a sculpture of F.O. Stanley holding one of his violins.  The sculpture was installed and  dedicated on September 29, 2016. Another hotel was used for filming the outside shots, and the Stanley for inside shots.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 30, 1974, horror writer Stephen King and his wife Tabitha spent one night at the Stanley Hotel during their one year of residency in Boulder, Colorado.[5] They were driving through Estes Park as night approached when they happened upon the Stanley Hotel. They decided to book a room and, upon checking in, discovered that they were the only overnight guests. \\"They were just getting ready to close for the season, and we found ourselves the only guests in the place? with all those long, empty corridors.\\"[6][7] He and his wife were served dinner in an empty dining room accompanied by canned orchestral music. \\"Except for our table all the chairs were up on the tables. So the music is echoing down the hall, and, I mean, it was like God had put me there to hear that and see those things.\\"[8]  That night, according to King, \\"I dreamed of my three-year-old son running through the corridors, looking back over his shoulder, eyes wide, screaming. He was being chased by a fire-hose. I woke up with a tremendous jerk, sweating all over, within an inch of falling out of bed. I got up, lit a cigarette, sat in a chair looking out the window at the Rockies, and by the time the cigarette was done, I had the bones of The Shining firmly set in my mind.\\"[9] Any big hotels have got scandals,\\" King wrote in The Shining. \\"Just like every big hotel has got a ghost. Why? Hell, people come and go. Sometimes one of em will pop off in his room, heart attack or stroke or something like that. Hotels are superstitious places.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shining was published in 1977 and became the third great success of King's career after Carrie and 'Salem's Lot. The Overlook Hotel - the fictional hotel in King's book inspired by the Stanley - is an evil entity haunted by its many victims. Room 217 of the Overlook features prominently in the novel, having been the room where King spent the night at the Stanley. This is the room on the second floor in the center of the west wing with a balcony overlooking the south terrace. Room 217 remains the hotel's most requested accommodation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1980, The Shining became the basis for a film adaptation directed by Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's vision for the movie differed from King's significantly in many ways, including the portrayal of the Overlook Hotel. The exteriors of Kubrick's Overlook were supplied by the Timberline Lodge on the slopes of Mt. Hood in Oregon. Inspiration for the interior sets (erected at Elstree Studios in England) came from the 1927 Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. The management of the Timberline Lodge, fearful that guests would refuse to stay in their Room 217 if it were featured in a horror movie, insisted that Kubrick change the haunted room in the film to Room 237.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997 The Shining TV series was produced, with the Stanley Hotel as the primary shooting location. A playhouse version of the main building which adorned the lawn of the Overlook Hotel in the series can be viewed in the basement of the Stanley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hotel has also been used as a filming location for other movies and TV shows; most notably, as the fictional \\"Hotel Danbury\\" of Aspen, Colorado, in the 1994 film Dumb and Dumber.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2013 to 2015, the hotel property hosted the Stanley Film Festival, an independent horror film festival operated by the Denver Film Society, held in early May. The festival featured screenings, panels, student competitions, audience awards and receptions.[12] The Stanley Film Festival was put on hiatus in 2016, and canceled for 2017.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe historic Stanley Concert Hall serves as venue for various musical groups such as country-punk band Murder By Death which has performed a Shining-themed series of concerts in the space.\\r\\n\\r\\nBravo's cooking competition,  Top Chef, also used the Stanley as a venue for Episode 10 of Season 15, all of which took place in various locations in Colorado.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite a peaceful early history, in the years following the publication of The Shining, The Stanley Hotel has gained a reputation among paranormal investigators for frequent activity.[14][15][16] The hotel offers guided \\"Ghost Tours\\" to guests and visitors which feature spaces reputed to be exceptionally active.[17][18] The hotel has also served as a location for numerous paranormal investigation shows such as Ghost Hunters[19][20] and Ghost Adventures.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stanley Hotel has hosted the following persons of note:","input":"What hotel was the basis for the shining?"},{"output":"all or predominantly single bonds","context":"A saturated fat is a type of fat in which the fatty acid chains have all or predominantly single bonds. A fat is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids. Fats are made of long chains of carbon (C) atoms. Some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds (-C-C-) and others are linked by double bonds (-C=C-).[1] Double bonds can react with hydrogen to form single bonds. They are called saturated, because the second bond is broken up and each half of the bond is attached to (saturated with) a hydrogen atom. Most animal fats are saturated. The fats of plants and fish are generally unsaturated.[1] Saturated fats tend to have higher melting points than their corresponding unsaturated fats, leading to the popular understanding that saturated fats tend to be solids at room temperatures, while unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature with varying degrees of viscosity (meaning both saturated and unsaturated fats are found to be liquid at body temperature).\\r\\nVarious fats contain different proportions of saturated and unsaturated fat. Examples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat include animal fat products such as cream, cheese, butter, other whole milk dairy products and fatty meats which also contain dietary cholesterol.[2] Certain vegetable products have high saturated fat content, such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil.[3] Many prepared foods are high in saturated fat content, such as pizza, dairy desserts, and sausage.[2][4]\\r\\nThe effect of saturated fat on risk of disease is controversial. Many reviews recommend a diet low in saturated fat and argue it will lower risks of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or death.[5][6] However, other reviews have challenged those arguments or advocated for examining the proportion of saturated to unsaturated fat in the diet.[7][8][9]\\r\\nWhile nutrition labels regularly combine them, the saturated fatty acids appear in different proportions among food groups. Lauric and myristic acids are most commonly found in \\"tropical\\" oils (e.g., palm kernel, coconut) and dairy products. The saturated fat in meat, eggs, cacao, and nuts is primarily the triglycerides of palmitic and stearic acids.\\r\\nSome common examples of fatty acids:\\r\\nSince the 1950s, it has been demonstrated that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oils.[21][22]\\r\\nThe effect of saturated fat on cardiovascular disease is controversial.[23]\\r\\nMany health authorities such as the American Dietetic Association,[24] the British Dietetic Association,[25] American Heart Association,[5] the World Heart Federation,[26] the British National Health Service,[27] among others,[28][29] advise that saturated fat is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The World Health Organization in May 2015 recommends switching from saturated to unsaturated fats.[30]\\r\\nA number of systematic reviews have examined the relationship between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease and have come to different conclusions:\\r\\nA 2017 systematic review by the American Heart Association of randomized controlled clinical trials showed that reducing intake of dietary saturated fat and replacing it with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats could reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30%, similar to the reduction achieved by statin treatment for maintaining blood cholesterol within normal limits.[5]\\r\\nA different 2017 systematic review of controlled randomized controlled trials concluded that replacing saturated fats with mostly n-6 polyunsaturated fats is unlikely to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) events, CHD mortality or total mortality. The 2017 review showed that inadequately controlled trials (e.g., failing to control for other lifestyle factors) that were included in earlier meta-analyses explain the prior results.[31]\\r\\nA 2015 systematic review also found no association between saturated fat consumption and risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or death.[32]\\r\\nA 2014 systematic review looking at observational studies of dietary intake of fatty acids, observational studies of measured fatty acid levels in the blood, and intervention studies of polyunsaturated fat supplementation concluded that the findings do not support cardiovascular guidelines that promote high consumption of long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids and suggest reduced consumption of total saturated fatty acids.[33] Researchers acknowledged that despite their results, further research is necessary, especially in people who are initially healthy. Due to potential weaknesses in this review, experts recommend people remain with the current guidelines to reduce saturated fat consumption.[34] The American Heart Association noted that these cohort studies, unlike clinical trials, have more difficulty controlling for the consumption of carbohydrates as a replacement macronutrient for those who consumed less saturated fat.[5]\\r\\nWhile many studies have found that including polyunsaturated fats in the diet in place of saturated fats produces more beneficial CVD outcomes,[5] the effects of substituting monounsaturated fats or carbohydrates are unclear.[46][47]\\r\\nThe consumption of saturated fat is generally considered a risk factor for dyslipidemia, which in turn is a risk factor for some types of cardiovascular disease.[48][49][50][51][52]\\r\\nThere are strong, consistent, and graded relationships between saturated fat intake, blood cholesterol levels, and the mass occurrence of cardiovascular disease.[5] The relationships are accepted as causal.[53][54] Abnormal blood lipid levels, that is high total cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, \\"bad\\" cholesterol) or low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, \\"good\\" cholesterol) cholesterol are all associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke.[26]\\r\\nMeta-analyses have found a significant relationship between saturated fat and serum cholesterol levels.[5][55] High total cholesterol levels, which may be caused by many factors, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[56][57] However, other indicators measuring cholesterol such as high total/HDL cholesterol ratio are more predictive than total serum cholesterol.[57] In a study of myocardial infarction in 52 countries, the ApoB/ApoA1 (related to LDL and HDL, respectively) ratio was the strongest predictor of CVD among all risk factors.[58] There are other pathways involving obesity, triglyceride levels, insulin sensitivity, endothelial function, and thrombogenicity, among others, that play a role in CVD, although it seems, in the absence of an adverse blood lipid profile, the other known risk factors have only a weak atherogenic effect.[59] Different saturated fatty acids have differing effects on various lipid levels.[60]\\r\\nA meta-analysis published in 2003 found a significant positive relationship in both control and cohort studies between saturated fat and breast cancer.[61] However two subsequent reviews have found weak or insignificant associations of saturated fat intake and breast cancer risk,[62][63] and note the prevalence of confounding factors.[62][64]\\r\\nOne review found limited evidence for a positive relationship between consuming animal fat and incidence of colorectal cancer.[65]\\r\\nA meta-analysis of eight observational studies published in 2001 found a statistically significant positive relationship between saturated fat and ovarian cancer.[66] However, a 2013 study found that a pooled analysis of 12 cohort studies observed no association between total fat intake and ovarian cancer risk. Further analysis revealed that omega-3 fatty acids were protective against ovarian cancer and that trans fats were a risk factor.[67] This study revealed that histological subtypes should be examined in determining the impact of dietary fat on ovarian cancer, rather than an oversimplified focus on total fat intake.\\r\\nSome researchers have indicated that serum myristic acid[68][69] and palmitic acid[69] and dietary myristic[70] and palmitic[70] saturated fatty acids and serum palmitic combined with alpha-tocopherol supplementation[68] are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in a dose-dependent manner. These associations may, however, reflect differences in intake or metabolism of these fatty acids between the precancer cases and controls, rather than being an actual cause.[69]\\r\\nMounting evidence indicates that the amount and type of fat in the diet can have important effects on bone health. Most of this evidence is derived from animal studies. The data from one study indicated that bone mineral density is negatively associated with saturated fat intake, and that men may be particularly vulnerable.[71]\\r\\nRecommendations to reduce or limit dietary intake of saturated fats are made by the World Health Organization,[72] American Heart Association,[5] Health Canada,[73] the US Department of Health and Human Services,[74] the UK Food Standards Agency,[75] the Australian Department of Health and Aging,[76] the Singapore Government Health Promotion Board,[77] the Indian Government Citizens Health Portal,[78] the New Zealand Ministry of Health,[79] the Food and Drugs Board Ghana,[80] the Republic of Guyana Ministry of Health,[81] and Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety.[82]\\r\\nIn 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) expert consultation report concluded that \\"intake of saturated fatty acids is directly related to cardiovascular risk.[83] The traditional target is to restrict the intake of saturated fatty acids to less than 10% of daily energy intake and less than 7% for high-risk groups. If populations are consuming less than 10%, they should not increase that level of intake. Within these limits, intake of foods rich in myristic and palmitic acids should be replaced by fats with a lower content of these particular fatty acids. In developing countries, however, where energy intake for some population groups may be inadequate, energy expenditure is high and body fat stores are low (BMI <18.5 kg/m2). The amount and quality of fat supply has to be considered keeping in mind the need to meet energy requirements. Specific sources of saturated fat, such as coconut and palm oil, provide low-cost energy and may be an important source of energy for the poor.\\"[83]\\r\\nA 2004 statement released by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) determined that \\"Americans need to continue working to reduce saturated fat intake\\"[84] In addition, reviews by the American Heart Association led the Association to recommend reducing saturated fat intake to less than 7% of total calories according to its 2006 recommendations.[85][86] This concurs with similar conclusions made by the US Department of Health and Human Services, which determined that reduction in saturated fat consumption would positively affect health and reduce the prevalence of heart disease.[87]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom, National Health Service claims the majority of British people eat too much saturated fat. The British Heart Foundation also advises people to cut down on saturated fat. People are advised to cut down on saturated fat and read labels on food they buy.[88][89]\\r\\nA 2004 review stated that \\"no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified\\" and recommended that the influence of varying saturated fatty acid intakes against a background of different individual lifestyles and genetic backgrounds should be the focus in future studies.[90]\\r\\nBlanket recommendations to lower saturated fat were criticized at a 2010 conference debate of the American Dietetic Association for focusing too narrowly on reducing saturated fats rather than emphasizing increased consumption of healthy fats and unrefined carbohydrates. Concern was expressed over the health risks of replacing saturated fats in the diet with refined carbohydrates, which carry a high risk of obesity and heart disease, particularly at the expense of polyunsaturated fats which may have health benefits. None of the panelists recommended heavy consumption of saturated fats, emphasizing instead the importance of overall dietary quality to cardiovascular health.[91]\\r\\nIn a 2017 comprehensive review of the literature and clinical trials, the American Heart Association published a recommendation that saturated fat intake be reduced or replaced by products containing monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, a dietary adjustment that could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 30%.[5]\\r\\nIt should be noted, as this is the defining factor of saturated fats, that the two-dimensional illustration has implicit hydrogen atoms bonded to each of the carbon atoms in the polycarbon tail of the myristic acid molecule (there are 13 carbon atoms in the tail; 14 carbon atoms in the entire molecule).\\r\\nCarbon atoms are also implicitly drawn, as they are portrayed as intersections between two straight lines. \\"Saturated,\\" in general, refers to a maximum number of hydrogen atoms bonded to each carbon of the polycarbon tail as allowed by the Octet Rule. This also means that only single bonds (sigma bonds) will be present between adjacent carbon atoms of the tail.","input":"What kind of bonds do saturated fats have?"},{"output":"March 15, 1991","context":"Neolithic age\\r\\nIron age\\r\\nEvents/Artifacts\\r\\n(by geography from North to South)\\r\\nLegendary\\r\\nEvents/Artifacts\\r\\nAmerican colonial period\\r\\nMount Pinatubo (Sambal: Bakil nin Pinatubu; Kapampangan: Bunduk/Bulkan ning Pinatubu, Bunduk ning Apu Malyari; Pangasinan: Palandey/Bulkan na Pinatubu; Ilokano: Bantay Pinatubo; Tagalog: Bundok/Bulkang Pinatubo) is an active stratovolcano in the Zambales Mountains, located on the tripoint boundary of the Philippine provinces of Zambales, Tarlac and Pampanga, all in Central Luzon on the northern island of Luzon.[3][4] Its eruptive history was unknown to most before the pre-eruption volcanic activities of 1991, just before June. Pinatubo was heavily eroded, inconspicuous and obscured from view. It was covered with dense forests which supported a population of several thousand indigenous Aetas.\\r\\nThe volcano's Ultra Plinian eruption on June 15, 1991, produced the second-largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century after the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in the Alaska Peninsula.[5] Complicating the eruption was the arrival of Typhoon Yunya (Diding), bringing a lethal messy mix of ash and rain to towns and cities surrounding the volcano. Predictions at the onset of the climactic eruption led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the surrounding areas, saving many lives. Surrounding areas were severely damaged by pyroclastic surges, ash falls, and subsequently, by the flooding lahars caused by rainwater re-mobilizing earlier volcanic deposits. This caused extensive destruction to infrastructure and changed river systems for years after the eruption.[5][6]\\r\\nThe effects of the eruption were felt worldwide. It ejected roughly 10,000,000,000 tonnes (1.1G1010 short tons) or 10?km3 (2.4?cu?mi) of magma, and 20,000,000 tonnes (22,000,000 short tons) of SO\\r\\n2, bringing vast quantities of minerals and toxic metals to the surface environment. It injected more particulate into the stratosphere than any eruption since Krakatoa in 1883. Over the following months, the aerosols formed a global layer of sulfuric acid haze. Global temperatures dropped by about 0.5?C (0.9?F) in the years 1991ÿ93,[7] and ozone depletion temporarily increased substantially.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe volcano is 87?km (54?mi) northwest of Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Near Mount Pinatubo, the United States maintained two large military bases in the region. The U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay was 37?km (23?mi) south of Pinatubo, and the extent of Clark Air Base was just 14?km (8.7?mi) east of the volcano's summit.[9] The volcano is near to about 6 million people.[10]\\r\\nMount Pinatubo's summit before the 1991 eruption was 1,745?m (5,725?ft) above sea level, only about 600?m (2,000?ft) above nearby plains, and only about 200?m (660?ft) higher than surrounding peaks, which largely obscured it from view.[11] It is part of a chain of volcanoes which lie along the western side of the island of Luzon called the Zambales Mountains.[12]\\r\\nPinatubo belongs to the Cabusilan sub-range of the Zambales Mountains, which consists of Mt. Cuadrado, Mt. Negron, Mt. Mataba and Mt. Pinatubo.[13] They are subduction volcanoes, formed by the Eurasian Plate sliding under the Philippine Mobile Belt along the Manila Trench to the west. Mount Pinatubo and the other volcanoes on this volcanic belt arise due to magmatic occlusion from this subduction plate boundary.[14]\\r\\nPinatubo is flanked on the west by the Zambales Ophiolite Complex, which is an easterly-dipping section of Eocene oceanic crust uplifted during the late Oligocene. The Tarlac Formation north, east and southeast of Pinatubo consists of marine, nonmarine and volcanoclastic sediments formed in the late Miocene and Pliocene.[15]\\r\\nThe most recent study of Mount Pinatubo before the activities of 1991 was the overall geological study in 1983 and 1984 made by F. G. Delfin for the Philippine National Oil Company as part of the surface investigations of the area before exploratory drilling and well testing for geothermal energy sources in 1988 to 1990. He recognized two life histories of the mountain, which he classified as \\"ancestral\\" and \\"modern\\" Pinatubo.[15][16]\\r\\nActivity of Ancestral Pinatubo seems to have begun about 1.1?million years ago and probably ended tens of thousands of years or more before the birth of \\"modern\\" Pinatubo. Much of the rugged land around the present volcano consists of remnants of \\"ancestral\\" Pinatubo. It was an andesite and dacite stratovolcano whose eruptive activity was much less explosive than modern Pinatubo. Its center was roughly where the current volcano is. The projected height of the mountain is up to 2,300?m (7,500?ft), 1.43 miles above sea level if it were a lone peak, based on a profile fitting to the remaining lower slopes, or lower if it had more than one peak.[15]\\r\\nThe old volcano is exposed in the walls of an old 3.5?km G?4.5?km (2.2?mi G?2.8?mi) wide caldera, referred to as Tayawan Caldera by Delfin. Some of the nearby peaks are the remnants of ancestral Pinatubo, left behind when the softer parts of the old mountain slopes were eroded by weathering. Ancestral Pinatubo is a somma volcano with modern Pinatubo as the new cone. Mount Dorst, to the east, is part of the dip slope of the ancestral Pinatubo. Several mountains near modern Pinatubo are old satellite vents of ancestral Pinatubo, forming volcanic plugs and lava domes. These satellite vents were probably active around the same time as the ancestral volcano and include the domes of Mount Negron, Mount Cuadrado, Mount Mataba and the Bituin and Tapungho plugs.[15]\\r\\nLater eruptions of modern Pinatubo occurred episodically and lasted for periods much shorter than the repose intervals between them. Subsequent eruptions and eruptive period occurred about:\\r\\nEach of these eruptions seems to have been very large, ejecting more than 10?km3 of material and covering large parts of the surrounding areas with pyroclastic flow deposits. Some eruptive periods have lasted decades and perhaps as much as several centuries and might appear to include multiple large explosive eruptions.[15]\\r\\nThe maximum size of eruptions in each eruptive period though has been getting smaller through the more than 35,000-year history of modern Pinatubo, but this might be an artifact of erosion and burial of older deposits. The oldest eruption of modern Pinatubo, Inararo, was also its largest.\\r\\nThe 1991 eruption was among the smallest documented in its geologic record.[15]\\r\\nThe volcano has never grown very large between eruptions, because it produces mostly unwelded, easily erodible deposits and periodically destroys the viscous domes that fill its vents. After the Buag eruption (c. 1500 AD), the volcano lay dormant, its slopes becoming completely covered in dense rainforest and eroded into gullies and ravines. The c. 500-year repose though between the Buag and present eruptive periods is among the shorter repose periods recognized in its geologic history.[15]\\r\\nOn July 16, 1990, the major 1990 Luzon earthquake of magnitude 7.7 struck northern Central Luzon and the Cordilleras. This was the largest earthquake recorded in 1990,[19][20] comparable in size to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Its epicenter was in the municipality of Rizal, Nueva Ecija,[21] about 100?km northeast of Pinatubo, and faulted northwest-southeast through three provinces.\\r\\nIt also followed the Philippine Fault System west as far as Baguio City, which was devastated, and is located about 80 kilometres (50?mi) north-northeast of Pinatubo, leading volcanologists to speculate that it might ultimately have triggered the 1991 eruption, although this is impossible to prove conclusively. Two weeks after the earthquake, local residents reported steam coming from the volcano, but scientists who visited there in response found only small rockslides rather than any pre-eruptive activity.\\r\\nOn March 15, 1991, a succession of earthquakes was felt by villagers on the northwestern side of the volcano. Further earthquakes of increasing intensity were felt over the next two weeks, and it became clear some kind of volcanic activity was likely. On April 2, the volcano awoke, with phreatic eruptions occurring near the summit along a 1.5?km (0.93?mi) long fissure. Over the next few weeks, small eruptions continued, dusting the surrounding areas with volcanic ash. Seismographs recorded hundreds of small earthquakes every day.\\r\\nScientists immediately installed monitoring equipment and analyzed the volcano for clues as to its previous eruptive history. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal found in old volcanic deposits revealed the last three major explosive eruption periods in recent millennia, about 5500, 3500 and 500 years ago. Geological mapping showed that much of the surrounding plains were formed by lahar flood deposits from previous eruptions.\\r\\nVolcanic activity increased throughout May. Measurements of sulfur dioxide emissions showed a rapid increase from 500?t (550 short tons) per day by May 13 to 5,000?t (5,500 short tons) per day by May 28. This implied that there was a rising column of fresh magma beneath the volcano. After May 28, the amount of SO\\r\\n2 being emitted decreased substantially, raising fears that the degassing of the magma had been blocked somehow, leading to a pressure build-up in the magma chamber and a high likelihood of violent explosive eruptions.\\r\\nThe first magmatic eruptions occurred on June 3, and the first large blast on June 7 generated ash columns 7?km (4.3?mi) high. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) immediately issued a warning indicating the possibility of a major eruption within two weeks.\\r\\nGiven all the signs that a very large eruption was imminent, PHIVOLCS ÿ assisted by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ÿ worked to convince local inhabitants of the high severity of the threat. A false warning might have led to cynicism about any later warnings, but delaying a warning until an eruption began might lead to thousands of deaths, so the volcanologists were under some pressure to deliver a timely and accurate assessment of the volcanic risk.\\r\\nThree successive evacuation zones were defined, the innermost containing everything within 10 kilometers of the volcano's summit, the second extending 10ÿ20 kilometers from the summit, and the third extending from 20ÿ40?km (12ÿ25?mi) from the summit (Clark Air Base and Angeles City were in this zone). The 10?km (6.2?mi) and 10ÿ20?km (6.2ÿ12.4?mi) zones had a total population of about 40,000 inhabitants, while some more 331,000 inhabitants lived in the 20ÿ40?km (12ÿ25?mi) zone.\\r\\nFive stages of volcanic alert were defined, from level 1 (low level seismic disturbances) up to level 5 (major eruption in progress). Daily alerts were issued stating the alert level and associated danger area, and the information was announced in major regional and national newspapers, on radio and television stations, by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and directly to the endangered inhabitants.\\r\\nMany of the Aetas who lived on the slopes of the volcano left their villages of their own volition when the first blasts began in April, gathering in a village about 12 kilometres (7.5?mi) from the summit. They moved to increasingly distant settlements as the eruptions escalated, some Aetas moving up to nine times in the two months before the colossal eruption.\\r\\nThe first formal evacuations were ordered for the 10?km (6.2?mi) zone on April 7. Evacuation of the 10ÿ20?km (6.2ÿ12.4?mi) zone was ordered when a level 4 alert was issued on June 7. A level 5 alert triggered evacuation of the 20ÿ40?km (12ÿ25?mi) zone on June 13, and in all some 60,000 people had left the area within 30 kilometres (19?mi) of the volcano before June 15. Most people temporarily relocated to Metro Manila, with some 30,000 using the Amoranto Velodrome in Quezon City as an evacuee camp.\\r\\nThe second-largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century, and by far the largest eruption to affect a densely populated area, occurred at Mount Pinatubo on June 15, 1991. The eruption produced high-speed avalanches of hot ash and gas, massive lahar floods and huge clouds of superheated volcanic material hundreds of kilometers across.[22]\\r\\nIn early June, tiltmeter measurements had shown that the volcano was gradually inflating, evidently due to fast-growing amounts of magma filling the reservoir beneath the summit. At the same time, seismic activity, previously concentrated at a depth of a few kilometers below a point about 5 kilometres (3.1?mi) northwest of the summit, shifted to shallow depths just below the summit.\\r\\nOn June 7, the first magmatic eruptions took place with the formation of a lava dome at the summit of the volcano. The dome grew substantially over the next five days, reaching a maximum diameter of about 200?m (660?ft) and a height of 40?m (130?ft).\\r\\nTimely forecasts of an eruption by scientists from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology and the U.S. Geological Survey enabled people living near the volcano to quickly evacuate to safer distances, saving at least 5,000 lives.\\r\\nA small blast at 03:41 PST on June 12 marked the beginning of a new, more violent phase of the eruption.\\r\\nA few hours later the same day, massive blasts lasting about half an hour generated big eruption columns, which quickly reached heights of over 19 kilometres (12?mi) and which generated large pyroclastic surges extending up to 4?km (2.5?mi) from the summit in some river valleys. Fourteen hours later, a 15-minute blast hurled volcanic matter to heights of 24?km (15?mi). Friction in the up-rushing ash column generated abundant lightning.\\r\\nA third large eruption began at 08:41 on June 13, after an intense swarm of small earthquakes over the previous two hours. It lasted about five minutes, and the eruption column once again reached 24 kilometres. After three hours of quiet, seismic activity began, growing more and more intense over the next 24 hours, until a three-minute eruptive blast generated a 21?km (13?mi) high eruption column at 13:09 on June 14.\\r\\nTephra fall from these four large eruptions was extensive to the southwest of the volcano. Two hours after the last of these four explosions, a series of eruptions began which lasted for the next 24 hours, and which saw the production of much larger pyroclastic flows and surges which travelled several kilometres down river valleys on the flanks of the volcano.\\r\\nDacite was the dominant igneous rock making up the tephra in these eruptions and in the following climactic event. The most abundant phenocryst minerals were hornblende and plagioclase, but an unusual phenocryst mineral was also present ÿ the calcium sulfate called anhydrite. The dacite magma was more oxidized than most magmas, and the sulfur-rich nature of the eruption was probably causally related to the redox state.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe final massive eruption of Mount Pinatubo began at 13:42 PST on June 15. It caused numerous major earthquakes due to the collapse of the summit and the creation of a caldera 2.5?km (1.6?mi) in diameter, reducing the peak from 1,745?m (5,725?ft) to 1,485?m (4,872?ft).[24]\\r\\nAll the seismographs close to Clark Air Base had been rendered completely inoperative by 14:30, mostly by super-massive pyroclastic surges. Intense atmospheric pressure variation was also recorded.\\r\\nOn the same day, Typhoon Yunya, locally named Diding, struck the island, with its center passing about 75?km (47?mi) north of the volcano. The typhoon rains mostly obscured the eruption, but measurements showed that ash was ejected to 34?km (21?mi) high by the most violent phase of the eruption, which lasted about three hours. Pyroclastic surges poured from the summit, reaching as far as 16?km (9.9?mi) away from their origin point. Typhoon rains mixed with the ash deposits causing a messy rain of mud and massive lahars.\\r\\nThe volcanic column from the crater covered an area of some 125,000?km2 (48,000?sq?mi), bringing total darkness to much of Central Luzon. Almost all of the island received some wet ash fall, which formed a heavy, rain-saturated snow-like blanket. Tephra fell over most of the South China Sea and ash falls were recorded as far away as Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.\\r\\nTwelve days after the first magmatic eruptions of June 3, on June 15, 1991, by about 22:30, and about nine hours after the onset of the most recent climactic phase, atmospheric pressure waves had decreased to the pre-eruption levels. No seismic records were available at this time, but volcanologists believe 22:30 PST marked the end of the climactic eruption.\\r\\nVast quantities of minerals and metals were brought to the surface. Overall, introduced to the surface environment was an estimated 800,000?t (880,000 short tons) of zinc, 600,000?t (660,000 short tons) of copper, 550,000?t (610,000 short tons) of chromium, 300,000?t (330,000 short tons) of nickel, and massive amounts of toxic heavy metals such as 100,000?t (110,000 short tons) of lead, 10,000?t (11,000 short tons) of arsenic, 1,000?t (1,100 short tons) of cadmium, and 800?t (880 short tons) of mercury.[25]\\r\\nAt least 16 commercial aircraft made damaging in-flight encounters with the ash cloud ejected by the June 15 eruption, as did other aircraft on the ground. The encounters caused loss of power to one engine on each of two aircraft. 10 engines were damaged and replaced, including all three engines of one DC-10. Longer term damage to aircraft and engines was reported, including accumulation of sulphate deposits on engines.[26] The eruption also irreparably damaged the Philippine Air Force's recently retired fleet of Vought F-8s, as these were in open storage at Basa Air Base at the time.[27]\\r\\nThe June 15 eruption had a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) of 6, and came some 450ÿ500 years after the volcano's last known eruptive activity. The eruption ejected about 10?km3 (2.4?cu?mi) of material, making it the largest eruption since that of Novarupta in 1912 and some ten times larger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Ejected material such as tephra fallout and pyroclastic flow deposits are much less dense than magma, and the volume of ejected material was equivalent to about 4?km3 (0.96?cu?mi) of unerupted material.[28]\\r\\nThe former summit of the volcano was obliterated and replaced by a caldera 2.5?km (1.6?mi) wide. The highest point on the caldera rim now stood 1,485?m (4,872?ft) above sea level, some 260?m (850?ft) lower than the pre-eruption summit.\\r\\nA reported 847 people were killed by the eruption, mostly by roofs collapsing under the severe weight of accumulated volcanic matter, a hazard amplified by the simultaneous arrival of Typhoon Yunya.[29][30] The evacuation in the days before the eruption certainly saved tens of thousands of lives, and has been hailed as a great success for volcanology and eruption prediction.\\r\\nAfter the eruption, about 500,000 people continue to live within 40?km (25?mi) of the volcano, with population centers including the 150,000 in Angeles City and 30,000 at Clark Freeport Zone.\\r\\nMany reforestation projects were destroyed in the eruption, with a total area of 150?km2 (37,000 acres) valued at 125?million pesos destroyed. Agriculture was heavily disrupted, with 800?km2 (200,000 acres) of rice-growing farmland destroyed, and almost 800,000?head of livestock and poultry killed, destroying the livelihoods of thousands of farmers. The cost to agriculture of eruption effects was estimated to be 1.5?billion pesos.\\r\\nMany farmers near Pinatubo began growing crops such as peanuts, cassava and sweet potatoes, which are quick-ripening and could be harvested before the threat of lahar floods during the late summer rainy season.[31]\\r\\nIn total, 364 communities and 2.1 million people were affected by the eruption, with livelihoods and houses being damaged and destroyed. More than 8,000 houses were completely destroyed, and a further 73,000 were damaged. In addition to the severe damage sustained by these communities, roads and communications were damaged or destroyed by pyroclastic surges and lahar floods throughout the areas surrounding the volcano. Total losses in 1991 and 1992 alone were estimated at 10.6 and 1.2 billion pesos respectively, including damage to public infrastructure estimated at 3.8 billion pesos (c. US$92,000,000). Education for thousands of children was seriously disrupted by the destruction of schools in the eruption.[32]\\r\\nThe eruption of Pinatubo severely hampered the economic development of the surrounding areas. The gross regional domestic product of the Pinatubo area accounted for about 10% of the total Philippine gross domestic product. The GRDP had been growing at 5% annually before the eruption, but fell by more than 3% from 1990 to 1991. In 1991, damage to crops and property was estimated at $374 million, to which continuing lahar floods added a further $69 million in 1992. 42 percent of the cropland around the volcano was affected by more lahar floods, dealing a severe blow to the agricultural economy in the region.[33]\\r\\nSince the eruption, each heavy rain has brought massive lahars from the volcano, displacing thousands of people and inflicting extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure costing billions to repair. A large supply of funds were spent in constructing dikes and dams to control the post-eruption lahar flows.[31]\\r\\nSeveral important river systems stem from Mount Pinatubo, the major rivers being the Abacan, Tarlac, Pasig-Potrero, Sta. Lucia, Bucao, Santo Tomas, Maloma, Tanguay, Ashley and Kileng rivers. Before the eruption, these river systems were important ecosystems, but the eruption filled many valleys with deep pyroclastic deposits. Since 1991, the rivers have been clogged with sediment, and the valleys have seen frequent lahars which continued for years after the eruption. Studies show that the river systems will take decades to recover from the June 1991 eruption.\\r\\nOn September 3, 1995, a lahar buried San Guillermo Parish Church to half its 12-meter height.[31]\\r\\nThe United States Air Force initiated a massive airlift effort to evacuate American service members and their families from the two affected bases during and immediately following the eruption, named Operation Fiery Vigil. Most personnel were initially relocated to Guam, Okinawa and Hawaii, although some returned to the continental United States. Clark Air Base was ultimately abandoned by the United States military, and Subic Bay reverted to Philippine control the next year following the breakdown of lease negotiations.\\r\\nThe powerful eruption of such an enormous volume of lava and ash injected significant quantities of aerosols and dust into the stratosphere. Sulfur dioxide oxidized in the atmosphere to produce a haze of sulfuric acid droplets, which gradually spread throughout the stratosphere over the year following the eruption. The injection of aerosols into the stratosphere is thought to have been the largest since the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, with a total mass of SO\\r\\n2 of about 17,000,000?t (19,000,000 short tons) being injected ÿ the largest volume ever recorded by modern instruments (see chart and figure).\\r\\nThis very large stratospheric injection resulted in a reduction in the normal amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by roughly 10% (see figure). This led to a decrease in northern hemisphere average temperatures of 0.5ÿ0.6?C (0.9ÿ1.1?F) and a global fall of about 0.4?C (0.7?F).[8][34] At the same time, the temperature in the stratosphere rose to several degrees higher than normal, due to absorption of radiation by the aerosol. The stratospheric cloud from the eruption persisted in the atmosphere for three years after the eruption. While not directly responsible, the eruption may have played a part in the formation of the 1993 Storm of the Century.[35]\\r\\nThe eruption had a significant effect on ozone levels in the atmosphere, causing a large increase in the destruction rate of ozone. Ozone levels at middle latitudes reached their lowest recorded levels, while in the southern hemisphere winter of 1992, the ozone hole over Antarctica reached its largest ever size until then, with the fastest recorded ozone depletion rates. The eruption of Mount Hudson in Chile in August 1991 also contributed to southern hemisphere ozone destruction, with measurements showing a sharp decrease in ozone levels at the tropopause when the aerosol clouds from Pinatubo and Hudson arrived.\\r\\nThe Aeta people were the hardest hit by the eruption. After the areas surrounding the volcano were declared safe, many Aetas returned to their old villages only to find them destroyed by pyroclastic and lahar deposits. Some were able to return to their former way of life, but most moved instead to government-organized resettlement areas. Conditions on these were poor, with each family receiving only small plots of land not ideal for growing crops. Many Aeta found casual labor working for lowland farmers, and overall Aeta society became much more fragmented, and reliant on and integrated with lowland culture.[36]\\r\\nExplosive eruption, late June 1991\\r\\nSnow-like ashfall caused by heavy rain mixing with ash columns\\r\\nErosional dissection of ash deposits on Pinatubo\\r\\nAircraft hangars at Clark Air Base destroyed by ashfall\\r\\nLahars from Pinatubo volcano fill the broad Santo Toms River valley SW of the volcano\\r\\nAshes from the eruption of Pinatubo cover the U.S. Naval Base in Subic Bay, Zambales\\r\\nA McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 owned by World Airways rests on its tail due to heavy ashfall deposited by the eruption at Cubi Point Naval Air Station\\r\\nHumanitarian aid received due to the eruption is as follows:\\r\\nThe government implemented several rehabilitative and reconstructive programs. Projects that will help deal with the aftermath brought about by lahar were also implemented. Among these is the construction of mega dikes. Moreover, to hasten the implementation of the basic services for the afflicted, private sectors, including the NGOs, took part in offering relief. They provided support and coordinated on the services that were deemed lacking from the side of the government.[37]\\r\\n1. Resettlement\\r\\n2. Livelihood programs focused on agriculture and industry (quick-generating income opportunities to affected families)\\r\\n3. Basic social services\\r\\n4. Infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction\\r\\nThe Asian Disaster Reduction Center was founded in Kobe, Hyogo prefecture, in 1998, with a mission to improve disaster resilience of its fifty member countries, to build safe communities, and to create a society where there is an achievable sustainable development. The Center works to build and to establish networks among countries through many programs such as personnel exchanges in this field. The Center addresses this issue from a global perspective in cooperation with various UN agencies and international organizations including the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO). The Asian Disaster Reduction Center focuses mainly on the following forms of aid:[37]\\r\\nAfter the eruption, many of the homes were destroyed and many of the areas affected by lahar were deemed uninhabitable. There was need to resettle the people particularly the Aetas and lowlanders. Resettlement for these two need to take into consideration the factors of their socio-cultural and socioeconomic differences.\\r\\nFaced with the destruction of many of the farmlands and the displacement of farmers and other workers the government had to search for a long term solution to address the issue. Agricultural based industries were also greatly affected. Closure of Clark Air base also raised an issue of finding short term livelihoods and the need to use the base lands to cushion the repercussions of the workers displacement.\\r\\nThe destruction brought about by the incident pressured social service sectors to continue their efforts in providing assistance in terms of health, social welfare and education. The services offered are not limited to the victims within the evacuation centers but also offered to the others affected. While the event happened during the opening of a school year, classes were needed to be push back as school facilities were destroyed. Providing resettlement for the evacuees was also a major concern. Social services was also provided in the prospective resettlement areas to prepare the victims when settling down.\\r\\nDestruction of many infrastructures was mostly due to the wet ash after the explosion. The regions roads, bridges, public buildings, facilities, communication and structures for river and flood control were some of the great concerns of the government. A need to establish measures for the flash floods and the threat caused by lahar also became an imperative demand to the government.\\r\\nThe aftereffects of the eruption damaged not only man-made structures but also farmlands, forestlands and watershed. River systems and overall environment of the affected region are also heavily damaged by the heavy lahar flow. To address this careful replanning of the land area region is necessary.\\r\\nThis event showed the need to engage in scientific studies to reassess the current policies and knowledge on areas with risk of eruption. Studies should also be allocated on possible application for the ash fall for industrial and commercial purposes. The significance of this concern affects both the government and private sectors.\\r\\nEven before the Philippine government officially appealed for international assistance, the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) shipped shelter material for victims of the floods and lahars in late July 1992. In the following month, they provided $375 000 to be used for relief and rehabilitation projects.[38] The Department of Social Welfare and Development had claimed during an informal donors meeting with representatives from mostly international agencies who compose the donor community that the national government was still well-equipped and had sufficient resources to aid the victims. The UN-Disaster Management Team (DMT) and the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs/United Nations Disaster Relief Organization (DHA/UNDRO) continued cooperating with the national government to monitor the situation and formulate ideas for further assistance.[38]\\r\\nIt was not until the then-President Fidel V. Ramos had declared the affected provinces and areas to be in a state of emergency that the national government officially requested for international assistance and for aid in projects for rehabilitation and relief provisions in the aforementioned areas. In response to this, the DHA/UNDRO reached out to the international community to respond to the appeal, and continued their operations, coordinating with the government.[38]\\r\\nAmong the countries that extended humanitarian relief assistance are United States, Canada, UK, Germany, Japan, China, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Spain, New Zealand, Finland, France, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Australia, India, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Malta, and Myanmar. International organizations which includes WHO, UNDP, UNICEF, UNDRO, and WFP also offered assistance. Relief assistance from these organizations and countries were in the form of either cash donation or relief items such as food packs, medicines, and shelter materials.[37]\\r\\nContributions made by the different systems of the United Nations (UN) are as follows:[39]\\r\\nCash from general resources\\r\\n150,000\\r\\nContributions made by participating countries in the UN are as follows:\\r\\nCash (AUD 250,000) through Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD)\\r\\n178,571\\r\\nCash (DM 100,000) through German Embassy)\\r\\n70,922\\r\\n1,000 boxes plastic sheeting (including air transport)\\r\\nCash through Philippine Business for Social Progress\\r\\nCash through Jamie Ongpin Foundation\\r\\nCash through A. Soriano Foundation\\r\\n726,800\\r\\n189,000\\r\\n175,000\\r\\n262,500\\r\\nSome specific projects under the auspices of the DPWH, which were made possible by foreign assistance, included:[37]\\r\\nFollowing the climactic eruption of June 15, 1991, activity at the volcano continued at a much lower level, with continuous ash eruptions lasting until August 1991 and episodic eruptions continuing for another month. Activity then remained low until July 1992 when a new lava dome started growing in the caldera. Volcanologists suspected that further violent eruptions could be possible, and some areas were evacuated. However, the eruption was only minor, and since that episode, the volcano has been quiet.\\r\\nThe 1991 caldera afterwards filled with water from annual monsoon rains and a crater lake, Lake Pinatubo, was formed. In 1992, a growing lava dome formed an island, which was eventually submerged by the lake. Initially, the lake was hot and highly acidic, with a minimum pH of 2 and a temperature of about 40?C (104?F). Subsequent rainfall cooled and diluted the lake, lowering the temperature to 26?C (79?F) and raising the pH to 5.5 by 2003.\\r\\nThe lake deepened by about 1?m (3.3?ft) per month on average, eventually submerging the lava dome, until September 2001, when fears that the walls of the crater might be unstable prompted the Philippine government to order a controlled draining of the lake. An estimated 9,000?people were once again evacuated from surrounding areas in case a large flood was accidentally triggered. Workers cut a 5?m (16?ft) notch in the crater rim and drained about a quarter of the lake's volume.[40]\\r\\nOn July 10, 2002, the west wall of the crater collapsed, slowly releasing approximately 160 million cubic meters of water and sediments into the Maraunot River in Botolan, Zambales.[41]\\r\\nOn July 26, 2011, a 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck close to Pinatubo; however, no major damages or casualties were reported.[42]\\r\\nThe word pinatubo could mean \\"fertile place where one can make crops grow\\", or could mean \\"made to grow\\", in Sambal and Tagalog, which may suggest a knowledge of its previous eruption in about 1500?AD. There is a local oral tradition suggestive of a folk memory of earlier large eruptions. An ancient legend tells of Bacobaco, a terrible spirit of the sea, who could metamorphose into a huge turtle and throw fire from his mouth. In the legend, when being chased by the spirit hunters, Bacobaco flees to the mountain and digs a great hole in its summit showering the surrounding land with rock, mud, dust and fire for three days; howling so loudly that the earth shakes.[43]\\r\\nAeta elders tell many stories about the history of the mountain, the best known being that it was once a Batung Mabye (Kapampangan language for \\"living stone\\"). It was said to have been planted on a kingdom by a displeased sorcerer but relocated by a hero. The mountain was soon turned into the abode of Apo Namalyari (\\"The lord of happenings/events\\"), the pagan deity of the Sambal, Aetas and Kapampangans living on the Zambales range.[44]\\r\\nIt was said to comprise the whole mountain range until Sinukuan of Mount Arayat (the god of the Kapampangans) became a strong rival of Namalyari. Their fight, which took place over the center plains, shattered the mountain into smaller bodies and Mount Arayat lost its center peak. Other versions have it that Pinatubo's peak shattered because of Namalyari's immense fury in an attempt to teach humans the meaning of fear and show how misdeeds will be punished.[44]\\r\\nAccording to the native elders, Apo Namalyari induced the June 1991 eruption because of displeasure toward illegal loggers and Philippine National Oil Company executives who performed deep exploratory drilling and well testing on the volcano looking for geothermal heat from 1988 to 1990.[45] Discouraging results from the wells forced the abandonment of the prospect 13 months before the April 2, 1991 explosions.[46]\\r\\nAfter being driven away by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, in May 2009 some 454 Aeta families in Pampanga were given the first clean ancestral land ownership on Mount Pinatubo with the Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), the government agency that deals with issues concerning indigenous people of the Philippines. The approved and declared net land area of 7,440.1?ha (18,385 acres) covers the barangays of Mawakat and Nabuklod in Floridablanca, Pampanga, plus a portion of San Marcelino, Zambales, and a portion of Barangay Batiawan in Subic, Zambales.[47]\\r\\nOn January 14, 2010, some 7,000 Aeta families from Zambales were officially granted the Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) covering the Zambales side of Pinatubo which includes the summit and Lake Pinatubo, officially becoming their lutan tua (ancestral land). The ancestral domain title covers 15,984?ha (39,500 acres) and includes the villages of Burgos, Villar, Moraza and Belbel in Botolan and portions of the towns of Cabangan, San Felipe and San Marcelino.[48][49]\\r\\nHaving the land title will protect them from others  including foreigners  exploiting their land without compensation and consent to the indigenous tribes. In the past, the Aetas had to contend with mining companies, loggers, and recently, tourist companies who earn from Mount Pinatubo but do not compensate the local tribes.[49]\\r\\nAncestral domain titles are awarded to a certain community or indigenous group who have occupied or possessed the land continuously in accordance with their customs and traditions since time immemorial. They have the legal right to collectively possess and to enjoy the land and its natural resources to the exclusion of others.[49]\\r\\nLong before Mt. Pinatubo became famous for its cataclysmic eruption, Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay, a native of Zambales, named his C-47 presidential plane \\"Mt. Pinatubo\\". The plane crashed in Mount Manunggal in Cebu province in 1957, killing the President and 24 others on board.[50]\\r\\nThe caldera formed and Lake Pinatubo has since become a tourist attraction with the preferred route through Barangay Santa Juliana in Capas, Tarlac.[51]","input":"What was the first sign that mt. pinatubo had awoken?"},{"output":"September 4, 1998","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle began in 1995 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both Ph.D. students at Stanford University.[2]\\r\\nIn the search of a dissertation theme, Page had been consideringamong other thingsexploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph.[3] His supervisor, Terry Winograd, encouraged him to pick this idea (which Page later recalled as \\"the best advice I ever got\\"[4]) and Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page, based on the consideration that the number and nature of such backlinks was valuable information about that page (with the role of citations in academic publishing in mind).[3]\\r\\nIn his research project, nicknamed \\"BackRub\\", Page was soon joined by Brin, who was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship.[5] Brin was already a close friend, whom Page had first met in the summer of 1995, when Page was part of a group of potential new students that Brin had volunteered to show around the campus.[3] Both Brin and Page were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP). The SDLP's goal was to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library\\" and it was funded through the National Science Foundation, among other federal agencies.[5][6][7][8]\\r\\nPage's web crawler began exploring the web in March 1996, with Page's own Stanford home page serving as the only starting point.[3] To convert the backlink data that it gathered for a given web page into a measure of importance, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm.[3] While analyzing BackRub's outputwhich, for a given URL, consisted of a list of backlinks ranked by importancethe pair realized that a search engine based on PageRank would produce better results than existing techniques (existing search engines at the time essentially ranked results according to how many times the search term appeared on a page).[3][9]\\r\\nConvinced that the pages with the most links to them from other highly relevant Web pages must be the most relevant pages associated with the search, Page and Brin tested their thesis as part of their studies, and laid the foundation for their search engine.:[10]\\r\\nOriginally the search engine used Stanford's website with the domain google.stanford.edu. The domain google.com was registered on September 15, 1997. They formally incorporated their company, Google, on September 4, 1998 in their friend Susan Wojcicki's garage in Menlo Park, California.\\r\\nBoth Brin and Page had been against using advertising pop-ups in a search engine, or an \\"advertising funded search engines\\" model, and they wrote a research paper in 1998 on the topic while still students. They changed their minds early on and allowed simple text ads.[12]\\r\\nBy the end of 1998, Google had an index of about 60?million pages.[13] The home page was still marked \\"BETA\\", but an article in Salon.com already argued that Google's search results were better than those of competitors like Hotbot or Excite.com, and praised it for being more technologically innovative than the overloaded portal sites (like Yahoo!, Excite.com, Lycos, Netscape's Netcenter, AOL.com, Go.com and MSN.com) which at that time, during the growing dot-com bubble, were seen as \\"the future of the Web\\", especially by stock market investors.[13]\\r\\nIn March 1999, the company moved into offices at 165 University Avenue in Palo Alto, home to several other noted Silicon Valley technology startups.[14] After quickly outgrowing two other sites, the company leased a complex of buildings in Mountain View at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway from Silicon Graphics (SGI) in 2003.[15] The company has remained at this location ever since, and the complex has since become known as the Googleplex (a play on the word googolplex, a number that is equal to 1 followed by a googol of zeros). In 2006, Google bought the property from SGI for US$319?million.[16]\\r\\nThe Google search engine attracted a loyal following among the growing number of Internet users, who liked its simple design.[17] In 2000, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords.[2] The ads were text-based to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed.[2] Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bid and click-throughs, with bidding starting at $.05 per click.[2] This model of selling keyword advertising was pioneered by Goto.com (later renamed Overture Services, before being acquired by Yahoo! and rebranded as Yahoo! Search Marketing).[18][19][20] While many of its dot-com rivals failed in the new Internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.[2]\\r\\nGoogle's declared code of conduct is \\"Don't be evil\\", a phrase which they went so far as to include in their prospectus (aka \\"S-1\\") for their 2004 IPO, noting that \\"We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better servedas shareholders and in all other waysby a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains.\\"[21] In 2008, Google launched Knol, their own equivalent of Wikipedia,[22] which failed just four years later.[23]\\r\\nIn 2011, the company launched Google+, its fourth foray into social networking, following Google Buzz (launched 2010, retired in 2011), Google Friend Connect (launched 2008, retired by March 1, 2012), and Orkut (launched in 2004, retired in September 2014[24])\\r\\nAs of November 2014, Google operated over 70 offices in more than 41 countries.[25]\\r\\nIn 2015, Google reorganized its interests as a holding company, Alphabet Inc., with Google as its leading subsidiary. Google continued to serve as the umbrella for Alphabet's Internet interests.[26][27][28]\\r\\nThe first funding for Google as a company was secured in August 1998 in the form of a US$100,000 contribution from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, given to a corporation which did not yet exist.[29]\\r\\nOn June 7, 1999, a round of equity funding totalling $25?million was announced;[30] the major investors being rival venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital.[29] While Google still needed more funding for their further expansion, Brin and Page were hesitant to take the company public, despite their financial issues. They were not ready to give up control over Google.\\r\\nFollowing the closing of the $25?million financing round, Sequoia encouraged Brin and Page to hire a CEO. Brin and Page ultimately acquiesced and hired Eric Schmidt as Googles first CEO in March 2001.[31]\\r\\nIn October 2003, while discussing a possible initial public offering of shares (IPO), Microsoft approached the company about a possible partnership or merger.[32] The deal never materialized. In January 2004, Google announced the hiring of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group to arrange an IPO. The IPO was projected to raise as much as $4?billion.\\r\\nGoogle's initial public offering took place on August 19, 2004.[33] A total of 19,605,052 shares were offered at a price of $85 per share.[34] Of that, 14,142,135 (another mathematical reference as |2  1.4142135) were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders. The sale raised US$1.67?billion, and gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23?billion.[35] Many of Google's employees became instant paper millionaires. Yahoo!, a competitor of Google, also benefited from the IPO because it owns 2.7?million shares of Google.[36]\\r\\nThe company was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol GOOG. When Alphabet was created as Google's parent company, it retained Google's stock price history and ticker symbol.\\r\\nIn February 2003, Google acquired Pyra Labs, owner of Blogger, a web log hosting website. The acquisition secured the company's competitive ability to use information gleaned from blog postings to improve the speed and relevance of articles contained in a companion product to the search engine Google News.\\r\\nIn February 2004, Yahoo! dropped its partnership with Google, providing an independent search engine of its own. This cost Google some market share, yet Yahoo!'s move highlighted Google's own distinctiveness,[citation needed] and today[when?] the verb \\"to google\\" has entered a number of languages (first as a slang verb and now as a standard word), meaning \\"to perform a web search\\" (a possible indication of \\"Google\\" becoming a genericized trademark).[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the IPO, Google's stock market capitalization rose greatly and the stock price more than quadrupled. On August 19, 2004 the number of shares outstanding was 172.85?million while the \\"free float\\" was 19.60?million (which makes 89% held by insiders). Google has a dual class stock structure in which each Class B share gets ten votes compared to each Class A share getting one. Page said in the prospectus that Google has \\"a dual class structure that is biased toward stability and independence and that requires investors to bet on the team, especially Sergey and me.\\"\\r\\nIn June, 2005, Google was valued at nearly $52?billion, making it one of the world's biggest media companies by stock market value.[37]\\r\\nOn August 18, 2005 (one year after the initial IPO), Google announced that it would sell 14,159,265 (another mathematical reference as   3.14159265) more shares of its stock to raise money. The move would double Google's cash stockpile to $7?billion. Google said it would use the money for \\"acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets\\".[38]\\r\\nOn September 28, 2005, Google announced a long-term research partnership with NASA which would involve Google building a 1,000,000-square-foot (93,000?m2) R&D center at NASA's Ames Research Center, and on December 31, 2005 Time Warner's AOL unit and Google unveiled an expanded partnershipsee Partnerships below.\\r\\nAdditionally in 2005, Google formed a partnership with Sun Microsystems to help share and distribute each other's technologies. As part of the partnership Google will hire employees to help in the open source office program OpenOffice.org.[39]\\r\\nWith Google's increased size came more competition from large mainstream technology companies. One such example is the rivalry between Microsoft and Google.[40] Microsoft had been touting its Bing search engine to counter Google's competitive position. Furthermore, the two companies are increasingly offering overlapping services, such as webmail (Gmail vs. Hotmail), search (both online and local desktop searching), and other applications (for example, Microsoft's Windows Live Local competes with Google Earth). In addition to an Internet Explorer replacement Google designed its own Linux-based operating system called Chrome OS to directly compete with Microsoft Windows. There were also rumors of a Google web browser, fueled much by the fact that Google was the owner of the domain name \\"gbrowser.com\\".[citation needed] These were later proven when Google released Google Chrome. This corporate feud boiled over into the courts when Kai-Fu Lee, a former vice-president of Microsoft, quit Microsoft to work for Google. Microsoft sued to stop his move by citing Lee's non-compete contract (he had access to much sensitive information regarding Microsoft's plans in China). Google and Microsoft reached a settlement out of court on December 22, 2005, the terms of which are confidential.[41]\\r\\nClick fraud also became a growing problem for Google's business strategy. Google's CFO George Reyes said in a December 2004 investor conference that \\"something has to be done about this really, really quickly, because I think, potentially, it threatens our business model.\\"[42]\\r\\nWhile the company's primary market is in the web content arena, Google has experimented with other markets, such as radio and print publications. On January 17, 2006, Google announced that it had purchased the radio advertising company dMarc, which provides an automated system that allows companies to advertise on the radio.[43] Google also began an experiment in selling advertisements from its advertisers in offline newspapers and magazines, with select advertisements in the Chicago Sun-Times.[44]\\r\\nDuring the third quarter 2005 Google Conference Call, Eric Schmidt said, \\"We don't do the same thing as everyone else does. And so if you try to predict our product strategy by simply saying well so and so has this and Google will do the same thing, it's almost always the wrong answer. We look at markets as they exist and we assume they are pretty well served by their existing players. We try to see new problems and new markets using the technology that others use and we build.\\"\\r\\nAfter months of speculation, Google was added to the Standard & Poor's 500 index (S&P 500) on March 31, 2006.[45] Google replaced Burlington Resources, a major oil producer based in Houston that had been acquired by ConocoPhillips.[46] The day after the announcement Google's share price rose by 7%.[47]\\r\\nIn its infancy, very little was needed to fully optimize on page content in the eyes of Google.[48] With an inverse relationship between query position (in the HTML tag hierarchy) and weight, it simply boiled down to putting ones important keywords higher on the HTML tag hierarchy.[49] With this relatively simple algorithm in place, webmasters quickly discovered tricks to vastly boost their SERP (Search Engine Ranking Position). One of the first instances of deceitful SEO came in the form of link keyword stuffing under on page content. As a response, Google removed these sites from its index, a practice it occasionally reverts to as a way of punishing disingenuous webmasters looking to cheat the system. The seemingly arbitrary changes to Googles PageRank algorithm however, led to both community outrage (many declaring the death of PageRank) and a noticeable decline in precision of search results.[50] Google was also constructing its index via a large monthly crawl. Not only did this lock search results to this one month window, it also meant that results would show stale content. An update dubbed Everflux introduced fresh crawling (daily crawls) to supplement the larger, primary crawl.[51] Daily crawling added another layer of relevancy (based upon date and time), to content ranking.[51] The inconsistencies of index versions across data centers during the early implementation of Everflux panicked webmasters, who saw their SERPs fluctuate wildly from day to day.\\r\\nGoogle's Boston update in February 2003 saw major algorithmic changes and the promise of frequent index updates.[52] Cassandra marked a much more aggressive attack on shady SEO techniques like hidden and disguised keyword links, by emphasizing link quality[52] This was taken a step further in Dominic, which sought to analyze the quality of all backlinks to prevent the then emerging practice of splogging (the practice of creating nonsensical offsite content to boost SERP of another site).[53] To combat practices like Googlebombing (putting irrelevant, often negative anchor text linking to popular websites) Dominic tinkered with the weighting of anchor text while stringently scrutinizing back links and internal linking.[54] An exploit where webmasters would link to the same site using different anchor text (thereby allowing both links to unfairly contribute to sites PageRank) was addressed by allowing only one site (given duplicate site links with differing anchor text) link to flow to PageRank.[55]\\r\\nFritz finalized the Everflux implementation, meaning Google's index would receive some degree of updating every day.[52] Daily crawling added another layer of relevancy, (based upon date and time), to content ranking.[51] The creation of a supplemental index was designed to house content Google felt didnt quite fit in its main index (due either to a low PageRank or shady linking practices).[56] Storing some sites in a separate index that was to be searched only when no good match was found in the primary index, Google hoped, would seamlessly filter out duplicate and untrustworthy content.[57] Questions about the efficacy of a multi-index system (particularly on improving recall) arose, and it remains unclear as to whether Google has retained this system.\\r\\nGoogle's Florida update looked to be the proverbial nail in the coffin for SEO abusers. With Florida, context and relevancy were determined not just by the appearance of keywords, but of synonyms and supporting vocabulary throughout the page.[58] This sought to eliminate keyword and inbound anchor text dumping.[59] Features that had long been experimented on, like phrase proximity and keyword stemming, became official and users were now being penalized for overly using commercial/popular keywords.[58] With Florida coming down hard on SEO, many webmasters with commercial presences on the web took a drastic hit. The real estate community in particular, was hit hard by Floridas changes to Google rankings. In its attempt at wide spread reform, the quality of results took a hit and many site owners felt they took undeserved drops.\\r\\nTo create seamless personalization of search (beyond manual filtering) Google began tapping into users browsing histories to deliver more relevant, personal results.[60] Promising to grow with the users browsing history, Personalized Search added a new dimension to search by incorporating past user behavior.[60] The implementation of personalized search was a blow to those relying on SEO techniques, as user browsing history was an element outside of their control.\\r\\nBy allowing webmasters to create and submit XML files dictating URLs to be crawled as well as procedural information regarding how the page should be crawled, Google expanded the scope of its index.[61] Providing an additional method of organically increasing site exposure, Google hoped, would decrease the need for shady SEO practices.\\r\\nBig Daddy was less an algorithmic change as it was a change of Google's crawling and indexing infrastructure.[62] Pages with superfluous, reciprocal linking schemes and irrelevant outbound and inbound links would be demoted in the new crawler.[62] Whereas previous updates handled the issue of link reliability through algorithmic changes, the Big Daddy modified how many pages a site would have crawled, and subsequently added to the index. The number of pages crawled on a site was again dependent on the relevance and quality of its links.[62]\\r\\nIn May 2007 Google implemented Universal search to its standard web results page.[63] Search results were now a compilation of all relevant results across all of Googles vertical search engines, (Google Images, Google Video etc.).[64] With the implementation of Universal Search, coverage of all types of content (not simply text) rose significantly. It now became important to optimize all forms of on-site content, not just on-site text content, increasing the complexity and breadth of SEO.\\r\\nGoogle Suggest marked the addition of real-time query suggestion. As users began to enter a query, a list of possible query matches would dynamically appear beneath the search bar, allowing for quicker and more accurate searches.[65] According to Google, only about 2% of all user queries were tracked and monitored, in an effort to better improve the service, quelling concerns over privacy.[65] The addition of instant suggestions added yet another dynamic to SEO, as webmasters now vied to associate their site with high ranking instant suggestion queries.[66]\\r\\nIn December 2009, Google integrated real time search results to its main SERP. Newly indexed, relevant content from social media and news sources would be dynamically inserted into a users SERP, thus providing real time content.[67] Google also announced its desire to prioritize original, user driven social media over authoritative, corporate social media.[68] Additionally, a separate updates filter was added, allowing the user to receive all incoming content from social media, sports, and news sources.[67]\\r\\nGoogles Caffeine was the result of a complete overhaul of Googles indexing structure.[69] To accommodate for the explosion of new forms of content (video, real-time content, images) and growing user expectations, Google ditched its old linear system of indexing in favor of the more flexible Caffeine, capable of indexing thousands of pages in parallel.[69] Google would no longer execute lengthy crawls supplemented by smaller daily crawls, but instead dynamically add to its index whenever new information appeared.[69] Caffeine was reported to offer 50% fresher content than Googles previous index, and required around 100 million gigabytes of storage.[69]\\r\\nIn February 2011, the New York Times published an article titled The Dirty Little Secrets of Search detailing back link purchasing by the clothing retailer JCPenney.[70] By purchasing thousands of backlinks (often on unrelated sites), JCPenney dominated Googles SERP across many clothing related queries, and even queries specifying a brand (JCPenney topped Samsonite for the query Samsonite carryon luggage).[70] Given Googles previous updates and their emphasis on backlink analysis, the JCPenney incident revealed that flaws still existed within the Google ranking algorithm. Google quickly demoted JCPenneys search position, crippling online sales.[70] Google has since lifted the demotion.\\r\\nThe name \\"Google\\" originated from a misspelling of \\"googol\\",[71][72] which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank:[73] \\"We chose our systems name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.\\"\\r\\nThere are uses of the name going back at least as far as the creation of the comic strip character Barney Google in 1919. British children's author Enid Blyton used the phrase \\"Google Bun\\" in The Magic Faraway Tree (published 1941) and The Folk of the Faraway Tree (published 1946),[74] and called a clown character \\"Google\\" in Circus Days Again (published 1942).[75] There is also the Googleplex Star Thinker from Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In March 1996 a business called Groove Track Productions applied for a United States trademark for \\"Google\\" for various products including several categories of clothing, stuffed toys, board games, and candy. The firm abandoned its application in July 1997.[76]\\r\\nHaving found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb \\"google\\" was added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006, meaning \\"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\\"[77][78] The use of the term itself reflects their mission to organize a seemingly infinite amount of information on the web.[72] In November 2009, the Global Language Monitor named \\"Google\\" No. 7 on its Top Words of the Decade list.[79] In December 2009 the BBC highlighted Google in their \\"Portrait of the Decade (Words)\\" series.[80] In May 2012, David Elliott filed a complaint against Google, Inc. claiming that Googles once distinctive mark GOOGLE? has become generic and lacks trademark significance due to its common use as a transitive verb. After losing to Google in UDRP proceedings involving many Google-related domain name registrations that he owns, Elliott later sought a declaratory judgment that his domain names are rightfully his, that they do not infringe any trademark rights Google may own, and that all Googles registered GOOGLE? marks should be cancelled since Google is now a common generic word worldwide that means to search the Internet.[81]\\r\\nIn 2004, Google formed a non-profit philanthropic wing that gave all the details to the user with a non profit aim and determination unlike, Google.org, giving it a starting fund of $1?billion.[82] The express mission of the organization is to help with the issues of climate change (see also global warming), global public health, and global poverty. Among its first projects is to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can attain 0.24 litre/10?km.[83]\\r\\nGoogle has worked with several corporations, in order to improve production and services. On September 28, 2005, Google announced a long-term research partnership with NASA which would involve Google building a 1,000,000-square-foot (93,000?m2) R&D center at NASA's Ames Research Center. NASA and Google are planning to work together on a variety of areas, including large-scale data management, massively distributed computing, bio-info-nano convergence, and encouragement of the entrepreneurial space industry. The new building would also include labs, offices, and housing for Google engineers.[84] In October 2006, Google formed a partnership with Sun Microsystems to help share and distribute each other's technologies. As part of the partnership Google will hire employees to help the open source office program OpenOffice.org.[39]\\r\\nTime Warner's AOL unit and Google unveiled an expanded partnership on December 21, 2005, including an enhanced global advertising partnership and a US$1?billion investment by Google for a 5% stake in AOL.[85] As part of the collaboration, Google plans to work with AOL on video search and offer AOL's premium-video service within Google Video. This did not allow users of Google Video to search for AOL's premium-video services. Display advertising throughout the Google network will also increase.\\r\\nIn August 2006, Google signed a $900?million offer with News Corp.'s Fox Interactive Media unit to provide search and advertising on MySpace and other News Corp. websites including IGN, AmericanIdol.com, Fox.com, and Rotten Tomatoes, although Fox Sports is not included as a deal already exists between News Corp. and MSN.[86][87]\\r\\nOn December 6, 2006, British Sky Broadcasting released details of a Sky and Google alliance.[88] This includes a feature where Gmail will link with Sky and host a mail service for Sky, incorporating the email domain \\"@sky.com\\".\\r\\nIn 2007, Google displaced America Online as a key partner and sponsor of the NORAD Tracks Santa program.[89][90][91] Google Earth was used for the first time to give visitors to the website the impression that they were following Santa Claus' progress in 3-D.[92] The program also made its presence known on YouTube in 2007 as part of its partnership with Google.[93]\\r\\nIn January 2009, Google announced a partnership with the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, allowing the Pope to have his own channel on YouTube.[94]\\r\\nIn January 2013, Google announced a partnership with Kia Motors and Hyundai. The partnership integrates Google Maps and Place into new car models to be released later in 2013.[95]\\r\\nIn coordination with several of the major corporations, including Microsoft, Nokia, LG, Samsung, and Ericsson, Google provided financial support in the launch of the .mobi top level domain created specifically for the mobile internet, stating that it is supporting the new domain extension to help set the standards that will define the future of mobile content and improve the experience of Google users.[96] In early 2006, Google launched Google.mobi, a mobile search portal offering several Google mobile products, including stripped-down versions of its applications and services for mobile users.[97] On September 17, 2007, Google launched \\"Adsense for Mobile\\", a service to its publishing partners providing the ability to monetize their mobile websites through the targeted placement of mobile text ads.[98] Also in September, Google acquired the mobile social networking site, Zingku.mobi to \\"provide people worldwide with direct access to Google applications, and ultimately the information they want and need, right from their mobile devices.\\"[99]\\r\\nOn Wednesday, January 18, 2006, the U.S. Justice Department filed a motion to compel in United States district court in San Jose seeking a court order that would compel search engine company Google Inc. to turn over \\"a multi-stage random sample of one million URLs\\" from Googles database, and a computer file with \\"the text of each search string entered onto Googles search engine over a one-week period (absent any information identifying the person who entered such query).\\"[100] Google maintains that their policy has always been to assure its users' privacy and anonymity, and challenged the subpoena. On March 18, 2006, a federal judge ruled that while Google must surrender 50,000 random URLs, the Department of Justice did not meet the necessary burden to force Google to disclose any search terms entered by its users in Google.\\r\\nA jury in Texas awarded Bedrock Computer Technologies $5?million in a patent lawsuit against Google.[101][102] The patent allegedly covered use of hash tables with garbage collection and separate chaining in the Red Hat Linux kernel. Google and Bedrock later settled the case and the judgment was vacated by the court.[103]\\r\\nIn November 2012, the UK government announced plans to investigate Google, along with Starbucks and Amazon.com, for possible tax avoidance.[104] On 20 January 2016, Google announced that it would pay S130m in back taxes to settle the investigation.[105] However, only 8 days later, it was announced that Google could end up paying more, and UK tax officials were under investigation for what has been termed a \\"sweetheart deal\\" for Google.[106]","input":"When did google start as a search engine?"},{"output":"about 10% of its territory","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territorial changes of Germany include all changes in the borders and territory of Germany from its formation in 1871 to the present. Modern Germany was formed in 1871 when Otto von Bismarck unified most of the German states, with the notable exception of Austria, into the German Empire.[1] After the First World War, Germany lost about 10% of its territory to its neighbours and the Weimar Republic was formed. This republic included territories to the east of today's German borders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period of Nazi rule from the 1930s through the end of the Second World War brought significant territorial losses for the country. Nazi Germany initially expanded the country's territory dramatically and conquered most of Europe, though not all areas were added to Germany proper. The Nazis' fortunes changed after the failure of the invasion of Soviet Union. The Nazi regime eventually collapsed, and the Allies occupied Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately after the war, all territorial gains were reversed and pre-war Germany was split into British, French and American occupation zones in the northwest, west and south and a Soviet occupation zone in the centre; the capital Berlin was similarly divided into four sectors. The former eastern territories of Germany were ceded to Poland and the Soviet Union and the Oder and Neisse Rivers became Germany's new eastern boundary. This territory became Poland's so-called \\"Recovered Territories\\", while approximately one-third of East Prussia became Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast; virtually the entire German population in these areas was expelled or fled. In the west, the Saar area formed a French-controlled protectorate with limited autonomy, but its own citizenship laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the onset of the Cold War, the western part of Germany was unified as the Trizone, becoming the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949 (\\"West Germany\\"). Western-occupied West Berlin declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 but was denied by the occupying powers. The Soviet zone, including the Soviet sector of Berlin, became the communist German Democratic Republic (\\"East Germany\\") in October the same year.[1] Effective 1 January 1957 the Saar Protectorate declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany, as provided by its Grundgesetz (constitution) art. 23 (Little Reunification). Following the end of the Cold War, East Germany, including East Berlin, and West Berlin used the same West German constitutional clause and declared their accession to the Federal Republic of Germany effective 3 October 1990 ÿ an event referred to as German reunification.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the motivation behind the territorial changes is based on historical events in Germany and Western Europe. Migrations that took place over more than a millennium led to pockets of Germans living throughout Central and Eastern Europe as far east as Russia. The existence of these enclaves was sometimes used by German nationalists, such as the Nazis, to justify territorial claims.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territorial changes of Germany after World War II can be interpreted in the context of the evolution of global nationalism and European nationalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century saw the rise of nationalism in Europe. Previously, a country consisted largely of whatever peoples lived on the land that was under the dominion of a particular ruler. As principalities and kingdoms grew through conquest and marriage, a ruler could wind up with many different ethnicities under his dominion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of nationalism was based on the idea of a \\"people\\" who shared a common bond through race, religion, language and culture. Furthermore, nationalism asserted that each \\"people\\" had a right to its own state. Thus, much of European history in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be understood as efforts to realign national boundaries with this concept of \\"one people, one state\\". Many interior conflicts were a result of more or less pressurising citizens of alternative ethnicities and/or other native languages to assimilate to the ethnicity dominant in the state. Switzerland was the exception, lacking a common native language.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch conflict would arise when one nation asserted territorial rights to land outside its borders on the basis of an ethnic bond with the people living on the land. Another source of conflict arose when a group of people who constituted a minority in one nation would seek to secede from the nation either to form an independent nation or join another nation with whom they felt stronger ties. Yet another source of conflict was the desire of some nations to expel people from territory within its borders because people did not share a common bond with the majority of people of that nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerritorial expansion of the Kingdom of Prussia, which in the 19th century would lead the future German unification efforts, started with the annexation of territories belonging to the PolishÿLithuanian Commonwealth. Between 1772 and 1795, Prussia took 141,400 km2 (54,600 sq mi) of the Commonwealth's western territoryareas known as Greater Poland, Pomorze and Mazovia (renaming them as South Prussia, West Prussia and New East Prussia)and with it nearly 1 million Polish speaking inhabitants. Frederick the Great immediately sent 57,475 German families to the newly conquered lands in order to solidify his new acquisitions,[2] and abolished the use of the Polish language.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the Napoleonic wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire the North German Confederation, led by Prussia, was combined with the southern states of Baden, Wrttemberg, Bavaria and Hesse and the formerly French newly annexed Alsace-Lorraine to form the German Empire in 1871. In some areas of Prussia's eastern provinces, such as the Province of Posen, the majority of the population was Polish. Many Lorrainians were by native language French. Most of the Alsatians and the Lorrainians of German native language rather clung to France (see Dput protestataire?(fr)), despite all nationalistic claim that language and culture would and should determine one's national affiliation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritain ceded Heligoland to Germany in 1890 in accordance with the terms of the HeligolandÿZanzibar Treaty. The Heligolanders, then still prevailingly fluent in their Heligolandic dialect of North Frisian, adopted German citizenship, like many other Frisians of Germany along the North Sea coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Russia's new Bolshevik (communist) government renounced all claim to Finland, the future Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Poland, Belarus, Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of these territories were in effect ceded to the German Empire, intended to become economically dependent on and politically closely tied to that empire under different German kings and dukes.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the ceded territories, the treaty stated that \\"Germany and Austria-Hungary intend to determine the future fate of these territories in agreement with their population\\" with few other effects than the appointment of German rulers to the new thrones of Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provisions of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I obliged Germany to cede some territory to other countries. Besides the loss of the German colonial empire the territories Germany lost were:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sudeten Germans had attempted to prevent the German language border areas of former Austria-Hungary from becoming part of Czechoslovakia in 1918. Once part of Bohemia, they had proclaimed the German-Austrian province of Sudetenland in October 1918, voting instead to join the newly declared Republic of German Austria in November 1918. However, this had been forbidden by the victorious allied powers of the First World War (the Treaty of Saint-Germain) and by the Czechoslovak government, partly with force of arms in 1919. Many Sudeten Germans rejected an affiliation to Czechoslovakia, since they had been refused the right to self-determination promised by US president Woodrow Wilson in his Fourteen Points of January 1918.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Silesian Uprisings (Polish: Powstania ?l?skie) were a series of three armed uprisings (1919ÿ1921) of Poles in the Upper Silesia region against Weimar Republic in order to separate the region (where in some parts Poles constituted a majority) from Germany and join it with the Second Polish Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy World War I, there were isolated groups of Germans or so-called Schwaben as far southeast as the Bosphorus (Turkey), Georgia, and Azerbaijan. After the war, Germany's and Austria-Hungary's loss of territory and the rise of communism in the Soviet Union meant that more Germans than ever constituted sizable minorities in various countries.[clarification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman nationalists used the existence of large German minorities in other countries as a basis for territorial claims. Many of the propaganda themes of the Nazi regime against Czechoslovakia and Poland claimed that the ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) in those territories were persecuted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nazis negotiated a number of population transfers with Joseph Stalin and others with Benito Mussolini so that both Germany and the other country would increase their ethnic homogeneity. However, these population transfers were not sufficient to appease the demands of the Nazis. The Heim ins Reich rhetoric of the Nazis over the continued disjoint status of enclaves such as Danzig and East Prussia was an agitating factor in the politics leading up to World War II, and is considered by many to be among the major causes of Nazi aggressiveness and thus the war. Adolf Hitler used these issues as a pretext for waging wars of aggression against Czechoslovakia and Poland.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 March 1936, Hitler sent a small expeditionary force into the demilitarized Rhineland. This was a clear violation of the Treaty of Versailles (1919, official end of World War I), and as such, France and Britain were within their rights, via the Treaty, to oust the German forces. British public opinion blocked any use of military force, thus preventing French action, as they were internally divided and would not act without British support.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1933, a considerable number of anti-Nazi Germans fled to the Saar, as it was the only part of Germany left outside the Third Reich's control. As a result, anti-Nazi groups campaigned heavily for the Saarland to remain under control of League of Nations as long as Adolf Hitler ruled Germany. However, long-held sentiments against France remained entrenched, with very few sympathizing openly with France. When the 15-year-term was over, a plebiscite was held in the territory on 13 January 1935: 90.3% of those voting wished to join Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 January 1935, the territory's re-union with Germany was approved by the League Council. On 1 March, Nazi Germany took over the region and appointed Josef Brckel as Reichskommissar fr die Rckgliederung des Saarlandes, \\"Imperial Commissioner for the re-union of Saarland\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the new Gau was extended to the Rhine, including the historic Palatinate, the region's name was changed again on 8 April 1940 to Gau Saarpfalz (Saar-Palatinate). After the Battle of France, the French dpartement of Moselle was incorporated in the Reichsgau.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allies were, on paper, committed to upholding the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which specifically prohibited the union of Austria and Germany. This notwithstanding, the Anschluss was among the first major steps in the Austrian-born Adolf Hitler's long-desired creation of an empire including German-speaking lands and territories Germany had lost after World War I.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events of 12 March 1938, marked the culmination of historical cross-national pressures to unify the German populations of Austria and Germany under one nation. However, the 1938 Anschluss, regardless of its popularity, was enacted by Germany. Earlier, Hitler's Germany had provided support for the Austrian National Socialist Party (Austrian Nazi Party) in its bid to seize power from Austria's Austrofascist leadership. Fully devoted to remaining independent but amidst growing pressures, the chancellor of Austria, Kurt Schuschnigg, tried to hold a plebiscite.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Schuschnigg expected Austria to vote in favour of maintaining autonomy, a well-planned coup d'tat by the Austrian Nazi Party of Austria's state institutions in Vienna took place on 11 March, prior to the vote. With power quickly transferred over to Germany, the Wehrmacht troops entered Austria to enforce the Anschluss. The Nazis held a plebiscite within the following month, where they received 99.73% of the vote. No fighting ever took place and the strongest voices against the annexation, particularly Fascist Italy, France and the United Kingdom (parties to the Stresa Front), were powerless or, in the case of Italy, appeased.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 29 September 1938, Adolf Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Benito Mussolini and douard Daladier signed the Munich Agreement. The Czechoslovak government capitulated on September 30 and reluctantly agreed to abide by the agreement. The settlement gave Germany the Sudetenland starting October 10, and de facto control over the rest of Czechoslovakia as long as Hitler promised to go no further.\\r\\n\\r\\nHitler and Chamberlain signed an additional resolution determining to resolve all future disputes between Germany and the United Kingdom through peaceful means. This is often confused with the Four-Power Munich Agreement itself, not least because most photographs of Chamberlain's return show him waving the paper containing the resolution, not the Munich Agreement itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout fortification which was built in Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia was now defenseless. On 5 October, Edvard Bene? resigned as President of Czechoslovakia, realising that the fall of Czechoslovakia was fait accompli. Following the outbreak of World War II, he would form a Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 March 1939, Nazi armies entered Prague and proceeded to occupy the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia, which was transformed into a protectorate of the Reich. The eastern half of the country, Slovakia, became a separate pro-Nazi state, the Slovak Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrime Minister Chamberlain felt betrayed by the Nazi seizure of Czechoslovakia, realising his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had failed, and immediately began to mobilize the British Empire's armed forces on a war footing. France did the same. Though no immediate action followed, Hitler's move on Poland in September started World War II in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy late 1938, Lithuania had lost control over the situation in the Memel Territory. In the early hours of 23 March 1939, after a political ultimatum had made a Lithuanian delegation travel to Berlin, the Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urb?ys and his German counterpart Joachim von Ribbentrop signed the Treaty of the Cession of the Memel Territory to Germany in exchange for a Lithuanian Free Zone in the port of Memel, using the facilities erected in previous years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter invading Poland in 1939, Germany annexed the lands it was forced to give to a reformed Poland in 1919ÿ1922 by the Treaty of Versailles, including the \\"Polish Corridor\\", West Prussia, the Province of Posen, and East Upper Silesia. The Volkstag of the Free City of Danzig voted to become a part of Germany again, although Poles and Jews were deprived of their voting rights and all non-Nazi political parties were banned. Parts of Poland that had not been part of Wilhelmine Germany were also incorporated into the Reich.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo decrees by Adolf Hitler (8 October and 12 October 1939) provided for the division of the annexed areas of Poland into the following administrative units:\\r\\n\\r\\nThese territories had an area of 94,000?km2 (36,000?sq?mi) and a population of 10,000,000 people. The remainder of the Polish territory was annexed by the Soviet Union (c. 52%; see MolotovÿRibbentrop Pact) or made into the German-controlled General Government occupation zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Bia?ystok Voivodeship, which included the Bia?ystok, Bielsk Podlaski, Grajewo, ?om?a, Sok܇?ka, Volkovysk, and Grodno Counties, was \\"attached to\\" (not incorporated into) East Prussia, while East Galicia was added to the General Government.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the invasion of France in 1940, Germany annexed the dpartements of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Moselle (Alsace-Lorraine). The German government never negotiated or declared a formal annexation, however, in order to preserve the possibility of an agreement with the West.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSee Eupen-Malmedy\\r\\n\\r\\nLuxembourg was invaded and occupied by German Forces in June 1940. It was formally annexed to Germany in August 1942.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom: History of Slovenia \\"After Yugoslavia fell, Germany, Italy, and Hungary each annexed parts of Slovenia, the largest part being Lower Styria which was annexed to the \\"Ostmark\\" (Nazi German Austria).\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSee Annexation of South Tyrol to Nazi Germany and Italian Social Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll areas that were incorporated into Nazi Germany between 1937 and 8 May 1945 were de facto repudiated at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences, and were therefore non-issues in the post-war division of Nazi Germany. One exception was Memelland, the incorporation of which at the end of March 1939 was recognised by the UK and France, but not by the USA.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it became evident that the Allies were going to defeat Nazi Germany decisively, the question arose as to how to redraw the borders of Central and Eastern European countries after the war. In the context of those decisions, the problem arose of what to do about ethnic minorities within the redrawn borders. The territorial changes at the end of World War II were part of negotiated agreements between the victorious Allies to redraw national borders and arrange for deportation of all Germans that were east of the OderÿNeisse line. The Allies occupied Germany, but the Western allies and Soviet Union formed separate governments covering specific parts of Germany (West Germany, as well as West Berlin, and East Germany). The Germanies and West Berlin reunified in 1990.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final decision to move Poland's boundary westward was made by the US, Britain and the Soviets at the Yalta Conference, shortly before the end of the war. The precise location of the border was left open; the western Allies also accepted in general the principle of the Oder River as the future western border of Poland and of population transfer as the way to prevent future border disputes. The open question was whether the border should follow the eastern or western Neisse rivers, and whether Stettin, the traditional seaport of Berlin, should remain German or be included in Poland.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, Germany was to retain Stettin while the Poles were to annex East Prussia with K?nigsberg. [1]. Eventually, however, Stalin decided that he wanted K?nigsberg as a year-round warm water port for the Soviet Navy and argued that the Poles should receive Stettin instead. The wartime Polish government in exile had little to say in these decisions.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nKey points of the meeting that are relevant to the territorial changes of Germany are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Potsdam Conference the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union placed the German territories within the 1937 Nazi Germany borders east of the OderÿNeisse line, and with the exception of parts of East Prussia, as formally under Polish administrative control (These were referred to by the Polish communist government as the \\"Western Territories\\" or \\"Regained Territories\\"). It was anticipated that a final peace treaty would follow shortly and either confirm this border or determine whatever alterations might be agreed upon. Northern East Prussia and Memelland were placed under Soviet administrative control. The 1919 Versailles Treaty created Free City of Danzig was also placed under Polish administration. The German population east of the OderÿNeisse line was expelled.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the conference, the Three Heads of Government agreed on the following actions:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with the status of these territories was that the concluding document of the Potsdam Conference in 1945 was not a legally binding treaty, but a memorandum between the USSR, the USA and the UK. It regulated the issue of the eastern German border, which was to be the OderÿNeisse line, but the final article of the memorandum said that the final decisions concerning Germany were to be subject to a separate peace treaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased upon this interpretation of the Potsdam Agreement, the CDU controlled German government maintained that the OderÿNeisse line was completely unacceptable and subject to negotiation. Also the Social Democrats of the SPD initially refused to accept the OderÿNeisse line. Thus, the official German government position on the status of areas vacated by settled German communities east of the OderÿNeisse rivers was that the areas were \\"temporarily under Polish (or [Soviet]) administration.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1970 and 1990, the West German political establishment gradually recognised the \\"facts on the ground\\" and accepted clauses in the Treaty on the Final Settlement, whereby Germany renounced all claims to territory east of the OderÿNeisse line.\\r\\nIn the Treaty of Warsaw (1970; ratified in 1972) West Germany recognized the OderÿNeisse line as Poland's western border and renounced any present and future territorial claims; this was reaffirmed by both German states in the 1990 Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany as a pre-condition for re-union. The treaty was ratified in 1991 by the united Germany. United Germany and Poland then finally settled the issue of the OderÿNeisse border by the GermanÿPolish Border Treaty in November 1990. This ended the legal limbo which meant that for 45 years, people on both sides of the border could not be sure whether the status quo reached in 1945 might be changed at some future date.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Working Party on Provisional Adjustments to the Western Frontiers of Germany\\" approved in 1949 the provisional transfer of 20?km2 (7.7?sq?mi) containing 500 inhabitants to Belgium:[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the 1956 treaty, in exchange for the territory ceded by Germany, Belgium ceded to Germany its territory north of the Fringshaus roads and bounded by the Vennbahn. The detached territory, in 1956 containing 704 inhabitants including refugees, was, prior to its 1956 dissolution and partition between West Germany and Belgium, ruled as an independent territory by Belgian Army Major General Paul Bolle, who enjoyed dictatorial powers.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the more extensive annexation proposals of the Bakker-Schut Plan, only a few border modifications were implemented. On 23 April 1949, Dutch troops occupied an area of 69?km2 (27?sq?mi), the largest parts of which were Elten (near Emmerich am Rhein) and Selfkant. Many other small border changes were executed, mostly in the vicinity of Arnhem and Dinxperlo. At that time, these areas were inhabited by a total of almost 10,000 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in March 1957, West Germany negotiated with the Netherlands for the return of these areas. The negotiations led to an agreement (German: Vertrag vom 8. April 1960 zwischen der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und dem K?nigreich der Niederlande zur Regelung von Grenzfragen und anderen zwischen beiden L?ndern bestehenden Problemen; short: Ausgleichsvertrag, i.e. treaty of settlement[7]) made in The Hague on 8 April 1960, in which Germany agreed to pay DEM 280 million for the return of Elten, Selfkant, and Suderwick, as Wiedergutmachung.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territory was returned to Germany on 1 August 1963, except for one small hill (about 3?km2, 1.2?sq?mi) near Wyler village, called Duivelsberg/Wylerberg which was annexed by the Netherlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting on 16 February 1946 France disentangled the Saar area and established the separate Saar Protectorate, further attaching parts of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Bavarian Palatinate (Saarpfalz). Like the former eastern territories of Germany the Saar area was out of the jurisdiction of the Allied Control Council for Germany and thus no part of Allied-occupied Germany. However, unlike the eastern territories the domestic Saar population was not expelled by the controlling French. With effect of 1 January 1957 the Saar Protectorate declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany, as provided by its Grundgesetz (constitution) art. 23 (Little Reunification), thus becoming the new federal state of Saarland.","input":"How much land was taken away from germany after ww1?"},{"output":"Confederacy","context":"Confederate victory\\r\\nThe Battle of Fort Sumter (April 12ÿ13, 1861) was the bombardment of Fort Sumter near Charleston, South Carolina by the Confederate States Army, and the return gunfire and subsequent surrender by the United States Army, that started the American Civil War. Following the declaration of secession by South Carolina on December 20, 1860, its authorities demanded that the U.S. Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor. On December 26, Major Robert Anderson of the U.S. Army surreptitiously moved his small command from the vulnerable Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island to Fort Sumter, a substantial fortress built on an island controlling the entrance of Charleston Harbor. An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861. South Carolina authorities then seized all Federal property in the Charleston area except for Fort Sumter.\\r\\nDuring the early months of 1861, the situation around Fort Sumter increasingly began to resemble a siege. In March, Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, the first general officer of the newly formed Confederate States Army, was placed in command of Confederate forces in Charleston. Beauregard energetically directed the strengthening of batteries around Charleston harbor aimed at Fort Sumter. Conditions in the fort, growing increasingly dire due to shortages of men, food, and supplies, deteriorated as the Union soldiers rushed to complete the installation of additional guns.\\r\\nThe resupply of Fort Sumter became the first crisis of the administration of the newly inaugurated U.S. President Abraham Lincoln following his victory in the election of November 6, 1860. He notified the Governor of South Carolina, Francis W. Pickens that he was sending supply ships, which resulted in an ultimatum from the Confederate government for the immediate evacuation of Fort Sumter, which Major Anderson refused. Beginning at 4:30?a.m. on April 12, the Confederates bombarded the fort from artillery batteries surrounding the harbor. Although the Union garrison returned fire, they were significantly outgunned and, after 34 hours, Major Anderson agreed to evacuate. There were no deaths on either side as a direct result of this engagement, although a gun explosion during the surrender ceremonies on April 14 caused two Union deaths.\\r\\nFollowing the battle, there was widespread support from both North and South for further military action. Lincoln's immediate call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion resulted in an additional four southern states also declaring their secession and joining the Confederacy. The battle is usually recognized as the first battle that opened the American Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 20, 1860, shortly after Abraham Lincoln's victory in the presidential election of 1860, South Carolina adopted an ordinance declaring its secession from the United States of America and, by February 1861, six more Southern states had adopted similar ordinances of secession. On February 7, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America and established their temporary capital at Montgomery, Alabama. A February peace conference met in Washington, D.C., but failed to resolve the crisis. The remaining eight states declined pleas to join the Confederacy.[5][6]\\r\\nThe seceding states seized numerous Federal properties within their boundaries, including buildings, arsenals, and fortifications. President James Buchanan protested but took no military action in response. Buchanan was concerned that an overt action could cause the remaining slave states to leave the Union, and while he acknowledged there was no constitutional authority for a state to secede, he could find no constitutional authority for him to act to prevent it.[7][8]\\r\\nSeveral forts had been constructed in Charleston's harbor, including Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie, which were not among the sites seized initially. Fort Moultrie on Sullivan Island was the oldestit was the site of fortifications since 1776and was the headquarters of the U.S. Army garrison. However, it had been designed as a gun platform for defending the harbor, and its defenses against land-based attacks were feeble; during the crisis, the Charleston newspapers commented that sand dunes had piled up against the walls in such a way that the wall could easily be scaled. When the garrison began clearing away the dunes, the papers objected.[9][10][11]\\r\\nMajor Robert Anderson of the 1st U.S. Artillery regiment had been appointed to command the Charleston garrison that fall because of rising tensions. A native of Kentucky, he was a protg of Winfield Scott, the general in chief of the Army, and was thought more capable of handling a crisis than the garrison's previous commander, Col. John L. Gardner, who was nearing retirement. Anderson had served an earlier tour of duty at Fort Moultrie and his father had been a defender of the fort (then called Fort Sullivan) during the American Revolutionary War. Throughout the fall, South Carolina authorities considered both secession and the expropriation of federal property in the harbor to be inevitable. As tensions mounted, the environment around the fort increasingly resembled a siege, to the point that the South Carolina authorities placed picket ships to observe the movements of the troops and threatened to attack when forty rifles were transferred to one of the harbor forts from the U.S. arsenal in the city.[1][12][13][11]\\r\\nIn contrast to Moultrie, Fort Sumter dominated the entrance to Charleston Harbor and, though unfinished, was designed to be one of the strongest fortresses in the world. In the fall of 1860 work on the fort was nearly completed, but the fortress was thus far garrisoned by a single soldier, who functioned as a lighthouse keeper, and a small party of civilian construction workers. Under the cover of darkness on December 26, six days after South Carolina declared its secession, Anderson abandoned the indefensible Fort Moultrie, ordering its guns spiked and its gun carriages burned, and surreptitiously relocated his command by small boats to Sumter.[14][15]\\r\\nSouth Carolina authorities considered Anderson's move to be a breach of faith. Governor Francis W. Pickens believed that President Buchanan had made implicit promises to him to keep Sumter unoccupied and suffered political embarrassment as a result of his trust in those promises. Buchanan, a former U.S. Secretary of State and diplomat, had used carefully crafted ambiguous language to Pickens, promising that he would not \\"immediately\\" occupy it.[16] From Major Anderson's standpoint, he was merely moving his existing garrison troops from one of the locations under his command to another. He had received instructions from the War Department on December 11, written by Major General Don Carlos Buell, Assistant Adjutant General of the Army, approved by Secretary of War John B. Floyd:[16][17]\\r\\n... you are to hold possession of the forts in this harbor, and if attacked you are to defend yourself to the last extremity. The smallness of your force will not permit you, perhaps, to occupy more than one of the three forts, but an attack on or attempt to take possession of any one of them will be regarded as an act of hostility, and you may then put your command into either of them which you may deem most proper to increase its power of resistance. You are also authorized to take similar steps whenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act.[18]\\r\\nGovernor Pickens therefore ordered that all remaining Federal positions except Fort Sumter were to be seized. State troops quickly occupied Fort Moultrie (capturing 56 guns), Fort Johnson on James Island, and the battery on Morris Island. On December 27, an assault force of 150 men seized the Union-occupied Castle Pinckney fortification, in the harbor close to downtown Charleston, capturing 24 guns and mortars without bloodshed. On December 30, the Federal arsenal in Charleston was captured, resulting in the acquisition of more than 22,000 weapons by the militia. The Confederates promptly made repairs at Fort Moultrie and dozens of new batteries and defense positions were constructed throughout the Charleston harbor area, including an unusual floating battery, and armed with weapons captured from the arsenal.[N 1]\\r\\nPresident Buchanan was surprised and dismayed at Anderson's move to Sumter, unaware of the authorization Anderson had received. Nevertheless, he refused Pickens's demand to evacuate Charleston harbor. Since the garrison's supplies were limited, Buchanan authorized a relief expedition of supplies, small arms, and 200 soldiers. The original intent was to send the Navy sloop-of-war USS Brooklyn, but it was discovered that Confederates had sunk some derelict ships to block the shipping channel into Charleston and there was concern that Brooklyn had too deep a draft to negotiate the obstacles. Instead, it seemed prudent to send an unarmed civilian merchant ship, Star of the West, which might be perceived as less provocative to the Confederates. As Star of the West approached the harbor entrance on January 9, 1861, it was fired upon by a battery on Morris Island, which was staffed by cadets from The Citadel, among them William Stewart Simkins, who were the only trained artillerymen in the service of South Carolina at the time. Batteries from Fort Moultrie joined in and Star of the West was forced to withdraw. Major Anderson prepared his guns at Sumter when he heard the Confederate fire, but the secrecy of the operation had kept him unaware that a relief expedition was in progress and he chose not to start a general engagement.[22][23][24][1]\\r\\nIn a letter delivered January 31, 1861, Governor Pickens demanded of President Buchanan that he surrender Fort Sumter because, \\"I regard that possession is not consistent with the dignity or safety of the State of South Carolina.\\"[25]\\r\\nConditions at the fort were difficult during the winter of 1860ÿ61. Rations were short and fuel for heat was limited. The garrison scrambled to complete the defenses as best they could. Fort Sumter was designed to mount 135 guns, operated by 650 officers and men, but construction had met with numerous delays for decades and budget cuts had left it only about 90 percent finished in early 1861. Anderson's garrison consisted of just 85 men, primarily made up of two small artillery companies: Company E, 1st U.S. Artillery, commanded by Capt. Abner Doubleday, and Company H, commanded by Capt. Truman Seymour. There were six other officers present: Surgeon Samuel W. Crawford, First Lt. Theodore Talbot of Company H, First Lt. Jefferson C. Davis of the 1st U.S. Artillery, and Second Lt. Norman J. Hall of Company H. Capt. John G. Foster and First Lt. George W. Snyder of the Corps of Engineers were responsible for construction of the Charleston forts, but they reported to their headquarters in Washington, not directly to Anderson. The remaining personnel were 68 noncommissioned officers and privates, eight musicians, and 43 noncombatant workmen.[1]\\r\\nBy April the Union troops had positioned 60 guns, but they had insufficient men to operate them all. The fort consisted of three levels of enclosed gun positions, or casemates. The second level of casemates was unoccupied. The majority of the guns were on the first level of casemates, on the upper level (the parapet or barbette positions), and on the center parade field. Unfortunately for the defenders, the original mission of the fortharbor defensemeant that it was designed so that the guns were primarily aimed at the Atlantic, with little capability of protecting from artillery fire from the surrounding land or from infantry conducting an amphibious assault.[26][27][28]\\r\\nIn March, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard took command of South Carolina forces in Charleston; on March 1, President Jefferson Davis had appointed him the first general officer in the armed forces of the new Confederacy,[29] specifically to take command of the siege. Beauregard made repeated demands that the Union force either surrender or withdraw and took steps to ensure that no supplies from the city were available to the defenders, whose food was running low. He also increased drills amongst the South Carolina militia, training them to operate the guns they manned. Major Anderson had been Beauregard's artillery instructor at West Point; the two had been especially close, and Beauregard had become Anderson's assistant after graduation. Both sides spent March drilling and improving their fortifications to the best of their abilities.[30]\\r\\nBeauregard, a trained military engineer, built-up overwhelming strength to challenge Fort Sumter. Fort Moultrie had three 8-inch Columbiads, two 8-inch howitzers, five 32-pound smoothbores, and four 24-pounders. Outside of Moultrie were five 10-inch mortars, two 32-pounders, two 24-pounders, and a 9-inch Dahlgren smoothbore. The floating battery next to Fort Moultrie had two 42-pounders and two 32-pounders on a raft protected by iron shielding. Fort Johnson on James Island had one 24-pounder and four 10-inch mortars. At Cummings Point on Morris Island, the Confederates had emplaced seven 10-inch mortars, two 42-pounders, an English Blakely rifled cannon, and three 8-inch Columbiads, the latter in the so-called Iron Battery, protected by a wooden shield faced with iron bars. About 6,000 men were available to man the artillery and to assault the fort, if necessary, including the local militia, young boys and older men.[31]\\r\\nOn March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated as president. He was almost immediately confronted with the surprise information that Major Anderson was reporting that only six weeks of rations remained at Fort Sumter. A crisis similar to the one at Fort Sumter had emerged at Pensacola, Florida, where Confederates threatened another U.S. fortificationFort Pickens. Lincoln and his new cabinet struggled with the decisions of whether to reinforce the forts, and how. They were also concerned about whether to take actions that might start open hostilities and which side would be perceived as the aggressor as a result. Similar discussions and concerns were occurring in the Confederacy.[32][33]\\r\\nAfter the formation of the Confederate States of America in early February, there was some debate among the secessionists whether the capture of the fort was rightly a matter for South Carolina or for the newly declared national government in Montgomery, Alabama. South Carolina governor Pickens was among the states' rights advocates who thought that all property in Charleston harbor had reverted to South Carolina upon that state's secession as an independent commonwealth. This debate ran alongside another discussion about how aggressively the installationsincluding Forts Sumter and Pickensshould be obtained. President Davis, like his counterpart in Washington, preferred that his side not be seen as the aggressor. Both sides believed that the first side to use force would lose precious political support in the border states, whose allegiance was undetermined; before Lincoln's inauguration on March 4, five states had voted against secession, including Virginia, and Lincoln openly offered to evacuate Fort Sumter if it would guarantee Virginia's loyalty.[N 2]\\r\\nThe South sent delegations to Washington, D.C., and offered to pay for the Federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with the Confederate agents because he did not consider the Confederacy a legitimate nation and making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government. However, Secretary of State William H. Seward, who wished to give up Sumter for political reasonsas a gesture of good willengaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed.[35]\\r\\nOn April 4, as the supply situation on Sumter became critical, President Lincoln ordered a relief expedition, to be commanded by former naval captain (and future Assistant Secretary of the Navy) Gustavus V. Fox, who had proposed a plan for nighttime landings of smaller vessels than the Star of the West. Fox's orders were to land at Sumter with supplies only, and if he was opposed by the Confederates, to respond with the U.S. Navy vessels following and to then land both supplies and men. This time, Maj. Anderson was informed of the impending expedition, although the arrival date was not revealed to him. On April 6, Lincoln notified Governor Pickens that \\"an attempt will be made to supply Fort Sumter with provisions only, and that if such attempt be not resisted, no effort to throw in men, arms, or ammunition will be made without further notice, [except] in case of an attack on the fort.\\"[36][37][38][39][1]\\r\\nLincoln's notification had been made to the governor of South Carolina, not the new Confederate government, which Lincoln did not recognize. Pickens consulted with Beauregard, the local Confederate commander. Soon President Davis ordered Beauregard to repeat the demand for Sumter's surrender, and if it did not, to reduce the fort before the relief expedition arrived. The Confederate cabinet, meeting in Montgomery, endorsed Davis's order on April 9. Only Secretary of State Robert Toombs opposed this decision: he reportedly told Jefferson Davis the attack \\"will lose us every friend at the North. You will only strike a hornet's nest. ... Legions now quiet will swarm out and sting us to death. It is unnecessary. It puts us in the wrong. It is fatal.\\"[40]\\r\\nBeauregard dispatched aidesCol. James Chesnut, Col. James A. Chisholm, and Capt. Stephen D. Leeto Fort Sumter on April 11 to issue the ultimatum. Anderson refused, although he reportedly commented, \\"I shall await the first shot, and if you do not batter us to pieces, we shall be starved out in a few days.\\" The aides returned to Charleston and reported this comment to Beauregard. At 1 a.m. on April 12, the aides brought Anderson a message from Beauregard: \\"If you will state the time which you will evacuate Fort Sumter, and agree in the meantime that you will not use your guns against us unless ours shall be employed against Fort Sumter, we will abstain from opening fire upon you.\\" After consulting with his senior officers, Maj. Anderson replied that he would evacuate Sumter by noon, April 15, unless he received new orders from his government or additional supplies. Col. Chesnut considered this reply to be too conditional and wrote a reply, which he handed to Anderson at 3:20?a.m.: \\"Sir: by authority of Brigadier General Beauregard, commanding the Provisional Forces of the Confederate States, we have the honor to notify you that he will open fire of his batteries on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time.\\" Anderson escorted the officers back to their boat, shook hands with each one, and said \\"If we never meet in this world again, God grant that we may meet in the next.\\"[41][42][43][44]\\r\\nAt 4:30?a.m. on April 12, 1861, Lt. Henry S. Farley, acting upon the command of Capt. George S. James,[45][46] fired a single 10-inch mortar round from Fort Johnson. (James had offered the first shot to Roger Pryor, a noted Virginia secessionist, who declined, saying, \\"I could not fire the first gun of the war.\\") The shell exploded over Fort Sumter as a signal to open the general bombardment from 43 guns and mortars at Fort Moultrie, Fort Johnson, the floating battery, and Cummings Point. Under orders from Beauregard, the guns fired in a counterclockwise sequence around the harbor, with 2 minutes between each shot; Beauregard wanted to conserve ammunition, which he calculated would last for only 48 hours. Edmund Ruffin, another noted Virginia secessionist, had traveled to Charleston to be present for the beginning of the war, and fired one of the first shots at Sumter after the signal round, a 64-pound shell from the Iron Battery at Cummings Point. The shelling of Fort Sumter from the batteries ringing the harbor awakened Charleston's residents (including diarist Mary Chesnut), who rushed out into the predawn darkness to watch the shells arc over the water and burst inside the fort.[47][N 3]\\r\\nMajor Anderson held his fire, awaiting daylight. His troops reported for a call at 6 a.m. and then had breakfast. At 7 a.m., Capt. Abner Doubleday fired a shot at the Ironclad Battery at Cummings Point. He missed. Given the available manpower, Anderson could not take advantage of all of his 60 guns. He deliberately avoided using guns that were situated in the fort where casualties were most likely. The fort's best cannons were mounted on the uppermost of its three tiersthe barbette tierwhere his troops were most exposed to incoming fire from overhead. The fort had been designed to withstand a naval assault, and naval warships of the time did not mount guns capable of elevating to shoot over the walls of the fort. However, the land-based cannons manned by the Confederates were capable of high-arcing ballistic trajectories and could therefore fire at parts of the fort that would have been out of naval guns' reach. Fort Sumter's garrison could only safely fire the 21 working guns on the lowest level, which themselves, because of the limited elevation allowed by their embrasures, were largely incapable of delivering fire with trajectories high enough to seriously threaten Fort Moultrie. Moreover, although the Federals had moved as many of their supplies to Fort Sumter as they could manage, the fort was quite low on ammunition, and was nearly out at the end of the 34-hour bombardment. A more immediate problem was the scarcity of cloth gunpowder cartridges or bags; only 700 were available at the beginning of the battle and workmen sewed frantically to create more, in some cases using socks from Anderson's personal wardrobe. Because of the shortages, Anderson reduced his firing to only six guns: two aimed at Cummings Point, two at Fort Moultrie, and two at the Sullivan's Island batteries.[49][50]\\r\\nShips from Fox's relief expedition began to arrive on April 12. Although Fox himself arrived at 3 a.m. on his steamer Baltic, most of the rest of his fleet was delayed until 6 p.m., and one of the two warships, USS Powhatan, never did arrive. Unbeknownst to Fox, it had been ordered to the relief of Fort Pickens in Florida. As landing craft were sent toward the fort with supplies, the artillery fire deterred them and they pulled back. Fox decided to wait until after dark and for the arrival of his warships. The next day, heavy seas made it difficult to load the small boats with men and supplies and Fox was left with the hope that Anderson and his men could hold out until dark on April 13.[51]\\r\\nAlthough Sumter was a masonry fort, there were wooden buildings inside for barracks and officer quarters. The Confederates targeted these with Heated shot (cannonballs heated red hot in a furnace), starting fires that could prove more dangerous to the men than explosive artillery shells. At 7 p.m. on April 12, a rain shower extinguished the flames and at the same time the Union gunners stopped firing for the night. They slept fitfully, concerned about a potential infantry assault against the fort. During the darkness, the Confederates reduced their fire to four shots each hour. The following morning, the full bombardment resumed and the Confederates continued firing hot shot against the wooden buildings. By noon most of the wooden buildings in the fort and the main gate were on fire. The flames moved toward the main ammunition magazine, where 300 barrels of gunpowder were stored. The Union soldiers frantically tried to move the barrels to safety, but two-thirds were left when Anderson judged it was too dangerous and ordered the magazine doors closed. He ordered the remaining barrels thrown into the sea, but the tide kept floating them back together into groups, some of which were ignited by incoming artillery rounds. He also ordered his crews to redouble their efforts at firing, but the Confederates did the same, firing the hot shots almost exclusively. Many of the Confederate soldiers admired the courage and determination of the Yankees. When the fort had to pause its firing, the Confederates often cheered and applauded after the firing resumed and they shouted epithets at some of the nearby Union ships for failing to come to the fort's aid.[52][53]\\r\\nThe fort's central flagpole was knocked down at 1 p.m. on April 13, raising doubts among the Confederates about whether the fort was ready to surrender. Col. Louis Wigfall, a former U.S. senator, had been observing the battle and decided that this indicated the fort had had enough punishment. He commandeered a small boat and proceeded from Morris Island, waving a white handkerchief from his sword, dodging incoming rounds from Sullivan's Island. Meeting with Major Anderson, he said, \\"You have defended your flag nobly, Sir. You have done all that it is possible to do, and General Beauregard wants to stop this fight. On what terms, Major Anderson, will you evacuate this fort?\\" Anderson was encouraged that Wigfall had said \\"evacuate,\\" not \\"surrender.\\" He was low on ammunition, fires were burning out of control, and his men were hungry and exhausted. Satisfied that they had defended their post with honor, enduring over 3,000 Confederate rounds without losing a man, Anderson agreed to a truce at 2:00?p.m.[54][55]\\r\\nFort Sumter raised Wigfall's white handkerchief on its flagpole as Wigfall departed in his small boat back to Morris Island, where he was hailed as a hero. The handkerchief was spotted in Charleston and a delegation of officers representing BeauregardStephen D. Lee, Porcher Miles, a former mayor of Charleston, and Roger Pryorsailed to Sumter, unaware of Wigfall's visit. Anderson was outraged when these officers disavowed Wigfall's authority, telling him that the former senator had not spoken with Beauregard for two days, and he threatened to resume firing. Meanwhile, General Beauregard himself had finally seen the handkerchief and sent a second set of officers, offering essentially the same terms that Wigfall had presented, so the agreement was reinstated.[54][56][57]\\r\\nThe Union garrison formally surrendered the fort to Confederate personnel at 2:30?p.m., April 13. No one from either side was killed during the bombardment. During the 100-gun salute to the U.S. flagAnderson's one condition for withdrawala pile of cartridges blew up from a spark, mortally wounding privates Daniel Hough and Edward Galloway, and seriously wounding the other four members of the gun crew; these were the first military fatalities of the war. The salute was stopped at fifty shots. Hough was buried in the Fort Sumter parade ground within two hours after the explosion. Galloway and Private George Fielding were sent to the hospital in Charleston, where Galloway died a few days later; Fielding was released after six weeks.[58][59] The other wounded men and the remaining Union troops were placed aboard a Confederate steamer, the Isabel, where they spent the night and were transported the next morning to Fox's relief ship Baltic, resting outside the harbor bar.[60]\\r\\nAnderson carried the Fort Sumter Flag with him North, where it became a widely known symbol of the battle, and rallying point for supporters of the Union.[61] This inspired Frederic Edwin Church to paint Our Banner in the Sky, described as a \\"symbolic landscape embodying the stars and stripes.\\" A chromolithograph was then created and sold to benefit the families of Union soldiers.[62]\\r\\nThe bombardment of Fort Sumter was the first military action of the American Civil War. Following the surrender, Northerners rallied behind Lincoln's call for all states to send troops to recapture the forts and preserve the Union. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90 days.[63] Some Northern states filled their quotas quickly. There were so many volunteers in Ohio that within 16 days they could have met the full call for 75,000 men by themselves.[64] Other governors from border states were undiplomatic in their responses. For example, Gov. Claiborne Jackson wrote, \\"Not one man will the state of Missouri furnish to carry on any such unholy crusade\\", and Gov. Beriah Magoffin wrote, \\"Kentucky will furnish no troops for the wicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern states.\\"[65] The governors of other states still in the Union were equally unsupportive. The call for 75,000 troops triggered four additional slave states to declare their secession from the Union and join the Confederacy.[66] The ensuing war lasted four years, effectively ending in April 1865 with the surrender of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at Appomatox Courthouse.[67]\\r\\nCharleston Harbor was completely in Confederate hands for almost the entire four-year duration of the war, leaving a hole in the Union naval blockade. Union forces conducted major operations in 1862 and 1863 to capture Charleston, first overland on James Island (the Battle of Secessionville, June 1862), then by naval assault against Fort Sumter (the First Battle of Charleston Harbor, April 1863), then by seizing the Confederate artillery positions on Morris Island (beginning with the Second Battle of Fort Wagner, July 1863, and followed by a siege until September). After pounding Sumter to rubble with artillery fire, a final amphibious operation attempted to occupy it (the Second Battle of Fort Sumter, September 1863), but was repulsed and no further attempts were made. The Confederates evacuated Fort Sumter and Charleston in February 1865 as Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman outflanked the city in the Carolinas Campaign. On April 14, 1865, four years to the day after lowering the Fort Sumter Flag in surrender, Robert Anderson (by then a major general, although ill and in retired status) returned to the ruined fort to raise the flag he had lowered in 1861.[68]\\r\\nTwo of the cannons used at Fort Sumter were later presented to Louisiana State University by General William Tecumseh Sherman, who was president of the university before the war began.[69]\\r\\nThe U.S. Post Office Department released the Fort Sumter Centennial issue as the first in the series of five stamps marking the Civil War Centennial on April 12, 1961, at the Charleston post office.[70]\\r\\nThe stamp was designed by Charles R. Chickering. It illustrates a seacoast gun from Fort Sumter aimed by an officer in a typical uniform of the time. The background features palmetto leaves akin to bursting shells. The state tree of South Carolina, the palmettos suggest the geopolitical area opening Civil War hostilities.[71]\\r\\nThis stamp was produced by an engraving and printed by the rotary process in panes of fifty stamps each. The Postal Department authorized an initial printing of 120 million stamps.[71]\\r\\nOnline resources","input":"Who won the battle of fort. sumter?"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},x={class:"card-container"};function P(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",x,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const B=d(M,[["render",P]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/44.md","filePath":"qapage/44.md"}'),D={name:"qapage/44.md"},G=Object.assign(D,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(B)]))}});export{H as __pageData,G as default};
