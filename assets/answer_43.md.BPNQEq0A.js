The song tells the story of an old woman who swallowed increasingly large animals , each to catch the previously swallowed animal . There are many variations of phrasing in the lyrics , especially for the description of swallowing each animal . The spider and fly are described in each verse , but the other animals are only described when they are introduced starting with the bird . The absurdity stems from the increasingly improbable solutions that only worsen the initial problem and are more likely to cause the woman 's death : the logic of swallowing of even more animals of preposterous sizes without dying , contrasted with the expected , matter - of - fact recounting of her death from swallowing an animal larger than herself , when in fact the swallowing of any animal as a solution was absurd . This song for children appeals to their initial logic that a fly can be swallowed by an old lady . A spider would also be seen as logical and physically possible . As you get to the bird , it slowly becomes clear for the child that it 's part of an imaginary scenario leading to a whole horse being swallowed . The last sentence brings the child back to a rational understanding that the old lady is in fact dead of course as physically this is impossible making place for children 's amusement and laughter ."},{"query":"who are the 2017 stars on dancing with the stars","short_answer":"","abstract":"Season twenty - five of Dancing with the Stars premiered on September 18 , 2017 , on the ABC network ."},{"query":"what was the host animal of the black plague","short_answer":"the fleas on rats","abstract":"Bubonic plague is one of three types of plague caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis .

Meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions . Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division , and sister chromatids are separated in the second division . Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle . Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor . Prokaryotes undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission , where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells .

In this process , the male inserts his penis into the female 's vagina and ejaculates semen , which contains sperm . A small proportion of the sperm pass through the cervix into the uterus , and then into the Fallopian tubes for fertilization of the ovum . Only one sperm is required to fertilize the ovum .

This marks the beginning of gestation , better known as pregnancy , which continues for around nine months as the foetus develops . When the foetus has developed to a certain point , pregnancy is concluded with childbirth , involving labor . During labor , the muscles of the uterus contract and the cervix dilates over the course of hours , and the baby passes out of the vagina .

Some lichens grow on rocks without soil , so may be among the first of life forms , and break down the rock into soil for plants . Since some uncolonized land may have thin , poor quality soils with few nutrients , pioneer species are often hardy plants with adaptations such as long roots , root nodes containing nitrogen - fixing bacteria , and leaves that employ transpiration . Note that they are often photosynthetic plants , as no other source of energy ( such as other species ) except light energy is often available in the early stages of succession , thus making it less likely for a pioneer species to be non-photosynthetic . The plants that are often pioneer species also tend to be wind - pollinated rather than insect - pollinated , as insects are unlikely to be present in the usually barren conditions in which pioneer species grow ; however , pioneer species tend to reproduce asexually altogether , as the extreme or barren conditions present make it more favourable to reproduce asexually in order to increase reproductive success rather than invest energy into sexual reproduction .

In 1945 , the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north . At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action . The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era .

Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support . South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union . The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea 's request for weapons and troops .

In chemical process industries like food , pharmaceutical , agricultural , textile , and paper , drying is an essential unit operation to remove moisture .

The pressure maintained in vacuum drying is generally 0.0296 -- 0.059 atm and the boiling point of water is 25 - 30 ° C.
