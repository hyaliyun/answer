The central bank can either buy or sell government bonds in the open market ( this is where the name was historically derived from ) or , in what is now mostly the preferred solution , enter into a repo or secured lending transaction with a commercial bank : the central bank gives the money as a deposit for a defined period and synchronously takes an eligible asset as collateral . A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy .

In cold weather , high speed diesel engines can be difficult to start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression , preventing ignition ( which relies on that heat ) . Pre-chambered engines use small electric heaters ( glowplugs ) inside the pre-chambers . Direct - injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber . The glowplug is a pencil - shaped piece of metal with a heating element at the tip . This heating element , when electrified , heats due to its electrical resistance and begins to emit light in the visible spectrum , hence the term glowplug .

It traces Western civilization ( as well as the Islamic and Mongolian conquests ) from the height of the Roman Empire to the fall of Byzantium . Volume I was published in 1776 and went through six printings . Volumes II and III were published in 1781 ; volumes IV , V , and VI in 1788 -- 1789 . The original volumes were published in quarto sections , a common publishing practice of the time . The work covers the history , from 98 to 1590 , of the Roman Empire , the history of early Christianity and then of the Roman State Church , and the history of Europe , and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and West . Because of its heavy use of primary sources , unusual at the time , its methodology became a model for later historians .

It is weaker than Earth 's gravity owing to the planet 's smaller mass . The average gravitational acceleration on Mars is 3.72076 ms ( about 38 % of that of Earth ) and it varies laterally . In general , topography - controlled isostasy drives the short wavelength free - air gravity anomalies . At the same time , convective flow and finite strength of the mantle lead to long - wavelength planetary - scale free - air gravity anomalies over the entire planet . Variation in crustal thickness , magmatic and volcanic activities , impact - induced Moho - uplift , seasonal variation of polar ice caps , atmospheric mass variation and variation of porosity of the crust could also correlate to the lateral variations . Over the years models consisting of an increasing but limited number of spherical harmonics have been produced . Maps produced have included free - air gravity anomaly , Bouguer gravity anomaly , and crustal thickness . In some areas of Mars there is a correlation between gravity anomalies and topography . Given the known topography , higher resolution gravity field can be inferred . Tidal deformation of Mars by the Sun or Phobos can be measured by its gravity . This reveals how stiff the interior is , and shows that the core is partially liquid . The study of surface gravity of Mars can therefore yield information about different features and provide beneficial information for future landing projects ."},{"query":"got a ticket for a ride on a big jet plane","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Big Jet Plane '' is a song written by Australian singer / songwriter Angus Stone , and originally recorded by Stone , under the name \`\` Lady of the Sunshine '' , on his 2009 album Smoking Gun .

Located in the northwestern region of the U.S. state of Wyoming , Grand Teton National Park is 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Yellowstone National Park which was established in 1872 , when Wyoming , Idaho and Montana were still territories and the region was very sparsely settled . By the late 19th century , conservationists were working to provide further protection to surrounding regions , leading President Grover Cleveland to create the Teton Forest Reserve , which included a portion of northern Jackson Hole . By 1902 , the reserve had been combined into the Yellowstone Forest Reserve , then was divided again in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt , establishing the Teton National Forest , which protected most of the Teton Range . By 1907 , the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had constructed a temporary dam at the Snake River outlet of Jackson Lake . This dam failed in 1910 and a new concrete Jackson Lake Dam replaced it by 1911 . The dam was further enlarged in 1916 , raising lake waters 39 ft ( 12 m ) as part of the Minidoka Project , designed to provide irrigation for agriculture in the state of Idaho . Though efforts to protect the Teton Range and Jackson Hole as part of an expanded Yellowstone National Park dated back to the late 19th century , proposals to construct more dams on some of the other lakes in Jackson Hole led Yellowstone National Park superintendent Horace Albright to block such efforts . Albright was originally an advocate of the expanded Yellowstone plan which was very unpopular with local residents . By the mid-1920s local sentiment had changed as a result of proposals for a new national park including only the Teton Range and six lakes at the base of the range . With the general agreement of prominent Jackson Hole residents to this plan , President Calvin Coolidge signed the executive order establishing the 96,000 - acre ( 39,000 ha ) Grand Teton National Park on February 26 , 1929 ."},{"query":"where is black mirror season 3 episode 3 filmed","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Crocodile '' is the third episode of the fourth series of anthology series Black Mirror .

Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year ."},{"query":"who won the half marathon 2016 held in delhi","short_answer":"","abstract":"Airtel Delhi Half Marathon ( ADHM ) is an annual half marathon foot - race held in New Delhi , India .

The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system . The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits . When the set pressure is exceeded , the relief valve becomes the \`\` path of least resistance '' as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route . The diverted fluid ( liquid , gas or liquid -- gas mixture ) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central , elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere . As the fluid is diverted , the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising . Once it reaches the valve 's reseating pressure , the valve will close . The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats . The blowdown can vary from roughly 2 -- 20 % , and some valves have adjustable blowdowns ."},{"query":"who did mekhi phifer play in 8 mile","short_answer":"Future","abstract":"8 Mile is a 2002 American drama film written by Scott Silver , directed by Curtis Hanson , and starring Eminem , Mekhi Phifer , Brittany Murphy , Michael Shannon , and Kim Basinger ."},{"query":"what's the limit on a amex black card","short_answer":"","abstract":"The American Express Centurion Card , known informally as the Amex Black Card , is an invitation - only charge card issued by American Express to platinum card holders after they meet certain criteria .

It requires \`\` reasonable '' governmental searches and seizures to be conducted only upon issuance of a warrant , judicially sanctioned by probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized . Under the Fourth Amendment , search and seizure ( including arrest ) should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court , usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it . Fourth Amendment case law deals with three issues : what government activities constitute \`\` search '' and \`\` seizure '' ; what constitutes probable cause for these actions ; and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed .

It conveys two analog message signals , or two digital bit streams , by changing ( modulating ) the amplitudes of two carrier waves , using the amplitude - shift keying ( ASK ) digital modulation scheme or amplitude modulation ( AM ) analog modulation scheme . The two carrier waves of the same frequency , usually sinusoids , are out of phase with each other by 90 ° and are thus called quadrature carriers or quadrature components -- hence the name of the scheme . The modulated waves are summed , and the final waveform is a combination of both phase - shift keying ( PSK ) and amplitude - shift keying ( ASK ) , or , in the analog case , of phase modulation ( PM ) and amplitude modulation . In the digital QAM case , a finite number of at least two phases and at least two amplitudes are used . PSK modulators are often designed using the QAM principle , but are not considered as QAM since the amplitude of the modulated carrier signal is constant . QAM is used extensively as a modulation scheme for digital telecommunication systems , such as in 802.11 Wi - Fi standards . Arbitrarily high spectral efficiencies can be achieved with QAM by setting a suitable constellation size , limited only by the noise level and linearity of the communications channel ."},{"query":"what is the northernmost gulf in the united states","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of the extreme points of the United States , the points that are farther north , south , east , or west than any other location in the country .

The name \`\` endospore '' is suggestive of a spore or seed - like form ( endo means within ) , but it is not a true spore ( i.e. , not an offspring ) . It is a stripped - down , dormant form to which the bacterium can reduce itself . Endospore formation is usually triggered by a lack of nutrients , and usually occurs in gram - positive bacteria . In endospore formation , the bacterium divides within its cell wall . One side then engulfs the other . Endospores enable bacteria to lie dormant for extended periods , even centuries . There are many reports of spores remaining viable over 10,000 years , and revival of spores millions of years old has been claimed . There is one report of viable spores of Bacillus marismortui in salt crystals approximately 250 million years old . When the environment becomes more favorable , the endospore can reactivate itself to the vegetative state . Most types of bacteria can not change to the endospore form .

It is the physical process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional three - dimensional structure from random coil . Each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mRNA to a linear chain of amino acids . This polypeptide lacks any stable ( long - lasting ) three - dimensional structure ( the left hand side of the first figure ) . As the polypeptide chain is being synthesized by the ribosome , the linear chain begins to fold into its three dimensional structure . Folding begins to occur even during translation of the polypeptide chain . Amino acids interact with each other to produce a well - defined three - dimensional structure , the folded protein ( the right hand side of the figure ) , known as the native state . The resulting three - dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence or primary structure ( Anfinsen 's dogma ) . The energy landscape describes the folding pathways in which the unfolded protein is able to assume its native state . Experiments beginning in the 1980s indicate the codon for an amino acid can also influence protein structure ."},{"query":"what year did seat belts come out in australia","short_answer":"1970|1971|By 1973","abstract":"Seat belt legislation requires the fitting of seat belts to motor vehicles and the wearing of seat belts by motor vehicle occupants .

At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action . The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era .

They generally pay more than part - time jobs per hour , and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part - time status as a primary factor . The Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) does not define full - time employment or part - time employment . This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer ( US Department of Labor ) . The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company 's Employee Handbook .

Gradually , other territories , colonies , and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada . The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec , which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas . With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada . Later , with Confederation in 1867 , the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada , which was subsequently divided into four provinces , Ontario , Quebec , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia . A number of other British colonies , such as Newfoundland and British Columbia , and large territories such as Rupert 's Land initially remained outside the newly formed federation . Over time , the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949 . Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs , Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 . This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom , and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Canada 's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act , subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom ."},{"query":"if not for you bob dylan and george harrison","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` If Not for You '' is a song by Bob Dylan , recorded for his 1970 album New Morning .

In humans , a woman 's fertility peaks in the early and mid-20s , after which it starts to decline slowly . While many sources suggest a more dramatic drop at around 35 , this is unclear since studies are still cited from the nineteenth century and earlier . One 2004 study of European women found fertility of the 27 - 34 and the 35 -- 39 groups had only a four - percent difference . At age 45 , a woman starting to try to conceive will have no live birth in 50 -- 80 percent of cases .

When factor analysis ( a statistical technique ) is applied to personality survey data , some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person . For example , someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as \`\` always prepared '' rather than \`\` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors . For example , extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness , assertiveness , excitement seeking , warmth , activity , and positive emotions ."},{"query":"who plays kelly in saved by the bell","short_answer":"Tiffani Amber Thiessen","abstract":""},{"query":"what is the difference between a graduated driver license and a driver license","short_answer":"","abstract":"Graduated driver licensing systems ( GDLS ) are designed to provide new drivers of motor vehicles with driving experience and skills gradually over time in low - risk environments .
