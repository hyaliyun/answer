The Dark Hunters are immortal warriors created by the goddess Artemis to battle the daimons ( who were created by her brother Apollo ) that kill humans in order to steal their souls so that they may live past their twenty seventh birthday . Artemis created the Dark Hunters as a way of controlling the Atlantean god , Acheron , whom she had bound to herself and who she had once had a relationship with prior to his human death at the hands of her brother . She knew of Acheron 's love and compassion for humans and his unwillingness to allow others to suffer when he could stop it .

A person must die as the direct result of a terrible betrayal , such as their best friend or a family member killing them in a brutal way . At the moment of their death , their soul will cry out for vengeance loudly enough to be heard by Artemis on Mount Olympus .

After those 24 hours are up , they must do their duty to mankind and hunt down the Daimons that prey on the humans .

These channels are slightly permeable to sodium ions , so they are also called Ca - Na channels , but their permeability to calcium is about 1000-fold greater than to sodium under normal physiological conditions . At physiologic or resting membrane potential , VDCCs are normally closed . They are activated ( i.e. , opened ) at depolarized membrane potentials and this is the source of the \`\` voltage - dependent '' epithet . The concentration of calcium ( Ca ions ) is normally several thousand times higher outside of the cell than inside . Activation of particular VDCCs allows Ca to rush into the cell , which , depending on the cell type , results in activation of calcium - sensitive potassium channels , muscular contraction , excitation of neurons , up - regulation of gene expression , or release of hormones or neurotransmitters . VDCCs have been immunolocalized in the zona glomerulosa of normal and hyperplastic human adrenal , as well as in aldosterone - producing adenomas ( APA ) , and in the latter T - type VDCCs correlated with plasma aldosterone levels of patients . Excessive activation of VDCCs is a major component of excitotoxicity , as severely elevated levels of intracellular calcium activates enzymes which , at high enough levels , can degrade essential cellular structures ."},{"query":"who is known as the father of history and why","short_answer":"","abstract":"Herodotus ( / hɪˈrɒdətəs / ; Ancient Greek : Ἡρόδοτος , Hêródotos , Attic Greek pronunciation : ( hɛː. ró. do. tos ) ) was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire ( modern - day Bodrum , Turkey ) and lived in the fifth century BC ( c. 484 -- c. 425 BC ) , a contemporary of Thucydides , Socrates , and Euripides .

According to this model , there is a lipid bilayer in which the protein molecules are embedded . The lipid bilayer gives fluidity and elasticity to the membrane . Small amounts of carbohydrates are also found in cell membrane . The model , which was devised by SJ Singer and GL Nicolson in 1972 , describes the cell membrane as a two - dimensional liquid that restricts the lateral diffusion of membrane components . Such domains are defined by the existence of regions within the membrane with special lipid and protein composition that promote the formation of lipid rafts or protein and glycoprotein complexes . Another way to define membrane domains is the association of the lipid membrane with the cytoskeleton filaments and the extracellular matrix through membrane proteins .

Chinese immigrants in the 19th century worked as laborers , particularly on the transcontinental railroad , such as the Central Pacific Railroad . They also worked as laborers in the mining industry , and suffered racial discrimination at every level of society . While industrial employers were eager to get this new and cheap labor , the ordinary white public was stirred to anger by the presence of this \`\` yellow peril '' . Despite the provisions for equal treatment of Chinese immigrants in the 1868 Burlingame Treaty , political and labor organizations rallied against the immigration of what they regarded as a degraded race and \`\` cheap Chinese labor '' . Newspapers condemned the policies of employers , and even church leaders denounced the entrance of these aliens into what was regarded as a land for whites only . So hostile was the opposition that in 1882 the United States Congress eventually passed the Chinese Exclusion Act , which prohibited immigration from China for the next ten years . This law was then extended by the Geary Act in 1892 . The Chinese Exclusion Act was the only U.S. law ever to prevent immigration and naturalization on the basis of race . These laws not only prevented new immigration but also brought additional suffering as they prevented the reunion of the families of thousands of Chinese men already living in the United States ( that is , men who had left China without their wives and children ) ; anti-miscegenation laws in many states prohibited the Chinese men from marrying white women ."},{"query":"what are at the end of each week month and year","short_answer":"","abstract":"An accounting period , in bookkeeping , is the period with reference to which accounting books of any entity are prepared ."},{"query":"church of the spilled blood st petersburg russia","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood ( Russian : Церковь Спаса на Крови , Tserkovʹ Spasa na Krovi ) is one of the main sights of St. Petersburg , Russia .

Hence , a pH indicator is a chemical detector for hydronium ions ( H O ) or hydrogen ions ( H ) in the Arrhenius model . Normally , the indicator causes the color of the solution to change depending on the pH . Indicators can also show change in other physical properties ; for example , olfactory indicators show change in their odor . The pH value of a neutral solution is 7.0 . Solutions with a pH value below 7.0 are considered acidic and solutions with pH value above 7.0 are basic ( alkaline ) . As most naturally occurring organic compounds are weak protolytes , carboxylic acids and amines , pH indicators find many applications in biology and analytical chemistry . Moreover , pH indicators form one of the three main types of indicator compounds used in chemical analysis . For the quantitative analysis of metal cations , the use of complexometric indicators is preferred , whereas the third compound class , the redox indicators , are used in titrations involving a redox reaction as the basis of the analysis ."},{"query":"when did monica and chandlers wedding episode air","short_answer":"May 17 , 2001","abstract":"Violin Renditions of : \`\` My Love '' by Paul McCartney and Wings '' \`\` A Groovy Kind of Love '' by Phil Collins"},{"query":"what is the meaning of bay leaves in telugu","short_answer":"","abstract":"Bay leaf ( plural bay leaves ) refers to the aromatic leaves of several plants used in cooking .

Biblical translation has been employed since the first translations were made from the Hebrew Bible ( Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic ) into Greek ( see Septuagint ) and Aramaic ( see Targum ) . Until the late Middle Ages , the Western Church used the Latin Vulgate almost entirely while the Eastern Church , centered in Constantinople , mostly used the Greek Byzantine text . Beginning with the 14th century , there have been increasing numbers of vernacular translations into various languages . With the development of modern printing techniques , these increased enormously . The English King James Version or \`\` Authorized Version '' , published in 1611 , has been one of the most debated English versions . Many supporters of the King James Version are disappointed with the departure from this translation to newer translations that use the Critical Text instead of the Byzantine text as the base text . There have also been debates regarding the benefits of formal translations over dynamic equivalence translations . Supporters of formal translation such as the King James Version criticize translations that use dynamic equivalence because the accuracy is compromised because this technique tends to reword the meaning of the text instead of translating it accurately in a word for word fashion . Additionally , these supporters are critical of translations using the critical text because they believe that biblical text has been deliberately deleted from the original autographs .

The collision theory states that when suitable particles of the reactant hit each other , only a certain percentage of the collisions cause any noticeable or significant chemical change ; these successful changes are called successful collisions . The successful collisions have enough energy , also known as activation energy , at the moment of impact to break the preexisting bonds and form all new bonds . This results in the products of the reaction . Increasing the concentration of the reactant particles or raising the temperature , thus bringing about more collisions and therefore many more successful collisions , increases the rate of reaction ."},{"query":"the black hills of south dakota are a good example of a(n)","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Black Hills ( Lakota : Ȟe Sápa ; Cheyenne : Moʼȯhta - voʼhonáaeva ; Hidatsa : awaxaawi shiibisha ) are a small and isolated mountain range rising from the Great Plains of North America in western South Dakota and extending into Wyoming , United States .

Strictly speaking , true nomads follow an irregular pattern of movement , in contrast with transhumance where seasonal pastures are fixed . However this distinction is often not observed and the term nomad used for both -- in historical cases the regularity of movements is often unknown in any case . The herded livestock include cattle , yaks , sheep , goats , reindeer , horses , donkeys or camels , or mixtures of species . Nomadic pastoralism is commonly practised in regions with little arable land , typically in the developing world , especially in the steppe lands north of the agricultural zone of Eurasia . Of the estimated 30 -- 40 million nomadic pastoralists worldwide , most are found in central Asia and the Sahel region of West Africa . Increasing numbers of stock may lead to overgrazing of the area and desertification if lands are not allowed to fully recover between one grazing period and the next . Increased enclosure and fencing of land has reduced the amount of land available for this practice . There is substantive uncertainty over the extent to which the various causes for degradation affect grassland . Different causes have been identified which include overgrazing , mining , agricultural reclamation , pests and rodents , soil properties , tectonic activity , and climate change . Simultaneously , it is maintained that some , such as overgrazing and overstocking , may be overstated while others , such as climate change , mining and agricultural reclamation , may be under reported .

In graphs of the electronic band structure of solids , the band gap generally refers to the energy difference ( in electron volts ) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in insulators and semiconductors . It is the energy required to promote a valence electron bound to an atom to become a conduction electron , which is free to move within the crystal lattice and serve as a charge carrier to conduct electric current . It is closely related to the HOMO / LUMO gap in chemistry . If the valence band is completely full and the conduction band is completely empty , then electrons can not move in the solid ; however , if some electrons transfer from the valence to the conduction band , then current can flow ( see carrier generation and recombination ) . Therefore , the band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a solid . Substances with large band gaps are generally insulators , those with smaller band gaps are semiconductors , while conductors either have very small band gaps or none , because the valence and conduction bands overlap ."},{"query":"can a parasite influence the evolution of its host","short_answer":"","abstract":"Host -- parasite coevolution is a special case of coevolution , which is defined as the reciprocal adaptive genetic change of two antagonists ( e.g. different species or genes ) through reciprocal selective pressures .

Castile became the dominant kingdom in Iberia because of its jurisdiction over the overseas empire in the Americas and the Philippines . The crown 's main source of wealth was from silver mined in Mexico and Peru . The structure of empire was established under the Spanish Hapsburgs ( 1516 -- 1700 ) and under the Spanish Bourbon monarchs , the empire was brought under greater crown control and increased its revenues from the Indies . The crown 's authority in The Indies was enlarged by the papal grant of powers of patronage , giving it power in the religious sphere . An important element in the formation of Spain 's empire was the dynastic union between Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon , known as the Catholic Monarchs , which initiated political , religious and social cohesion but not political unification .

Classically , conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass ; however , special relativity showed that mass is related to energy and vice versa by E = mc , and science now takes the view that mass -- energy is conserved ."},{"query":"who illuminated the original document of constitution of indi","short_answer":"artists from Shantiniketan including Beohar Rammanohar Sinha and Nandalal Bose","abstract":"The Constitution of India is the supreme law of India .
