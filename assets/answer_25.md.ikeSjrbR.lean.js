These two forces compete , leading to some combinations of neutrons and protons being more stable than others . Neutrons stabilize the nucleus , because they attract protons , which helps offset the electrical repulsion between protons . As a result , as the number of protons increases , an increasing ratio of neutrons to protons is needed to form a stable nucleus ; if too many or too few neutrons are present with regard to the optimum ratio , the nucleus becomes unstable and subject to certain types of nuclear decay . Unstable isotopes decay through various radioactive decay pathways , most commonly alpha decay , beta decay , or electron capture .

This contrasts with a monopsony which relates to a single entity 's control of a market to purchase a good or service , and with oligopoly which consists of a few sellers dominating a market . Monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service , a lack of viable substitute goods , and the possibility of a high monopoly price well above the seller 's marginal cost that leads to a high monopoly profit . The verb monopolise or monopolize refers to the process by which a company gains the ability to raise prices or exclude competitors . In economics , a monopoly is a single seller . In law , a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power , that is , the power to charge overly high prices .

A thermoconforming organism , by contrast , simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature , thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation . The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis : a state of dynamic stability in an organism 's internal conditions , maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment ( the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology ) . If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal , a condition known as hyperthermia occurs . For humans , this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately 55 ° C ( 131 ° F ) , and with prolonged exposure ( longer than a few hours ) at this temperature and up to around 75 ° C ( 167 ° F ) death is almost inevitable . Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) for six hours . The opposite condition , when body temperature decreases below normal levels , is known as hypothermia . It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction , causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it . Normal body temperature is around 37 ° C ( 99 ° F ) , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures , hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range ."},{"query":"florence and the machine i got the love","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"when did central warm air systems for residential and commercial applications became well​ defined","short_answer":"","abstract":"A central heating system provides warmth to the whole interior of a building ( or portion of a building ) from one point to multiple rooms .

Proteins are polymers -- specifically polypeptides -- formed from sequences of amino acids , the monomers of the polymer . A single amino acid monomer may also be called a residue indicating a repeating unit of a polymer . Proteins form by amino acids undergoing condensation reactions , in which the amino acids lose one water molecule per reaction in order to attach to one another with a peptide bond . By convention , a chain under 30 amino acids is often identified as a peptide , rather than a protein . To be able to perform their biological function , proteins fold into one or more specific spatial conformations driven by a number of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding , ionic interactions , Van der Waals forces , and hydrophobic packing . To understand the functions of proteins at a molecular level , it is often necessary to determine their three - dimensional structure . This is the topic of the scientific field of structural biology , which employs techniques such as X-ray crystallography , NMR spectroscopy , and dual polarisation interferometry to determine the structure of proteins ."},{"query":"when did mad max fury road come out","short_answer":"2015","abstract":"Mad Max : Fury Road is a 2015 action film co-written , produced , and directed by George Miller .

A motor unit consists of one motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers it stimulates . All muscles consist of a number of motor units and the fibers belonging to a motor unit are dispersed and intermingle amongst fibers of other units . The muscle fibers belonging to one motor unit can be spread throughout part , or most of the entire muscle , depending on the number of fibers and size of the muscle . When a motor neuron is activated , all of the muscle fibers innervated by the motor neuron are stimulated and contract . The activation of one motor neuron will result in a weak but distributed muscle contraction . The activation of more motor neurons will result in more muscle fibers being activated , and therefore a stronger muscle contraction . Motor unit recruitment is a measure of how many motor neurons are activated in a particular muscle , and therefore is a measure of how many muscle fibers of that muscle are activated . The higher the recruitment the stronger the muscle contraction will be . Motor units are generally recruited in order of smallest to largest ( smallest motor neurons to largest motor neurons , and thus slow to fast twitch ) as contraction increases . This is known as Henneman 's Size Principle ."},{"query":"what is the number of members in the house of representatives","short_answer":"435","abstract":""},{"query":"who does marcus paige play for in the nba","short_answer":"Greensboro Swarm of the NBA G League","abstract":"Marcus Taylor Paige ( born September 11 , 1993 ) is an American professional basketball player for the Greensboro Swarm of the NBA G League , on a two - way contract with the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) .

Electrical stimulation is transmitted onto dendrites by upstream neurons ( usually their axons ) via synapses which are located at various points throughout the dendritic tree . Dendrites play a critical role in integrating these synaptic inputs and in determining the extent to which action potentials are produced by the neuron . Dendritic arborization , also known as dendritic branching , is a multi-step biological process by which neurons form new dendritic trees and branches to create new synapses . The morphology of dendrites such as branch density and grouping patterns are highly correlated to the function of the neuron .

The central bank can either buy or sell government bonds in the open market ( this is where the name was historically derived from ) or , in what is now mostly the preferred solution , enter into a repo or secured lending transaction with a commercial bank : the central bank gives the money as a deposit for a defined period and synchronously takes an eligible asset as collateral . A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy .

Born on lands likely belonging to the Monkwearmouth monastery , Bede was sent there at age seven and later joined Abbot Ceolfrith at the Jarrow monastery , both of whom survived a plague that struck in 686 , an outbreak that killed a majority of the population there . While he spent most of his life in the monastery , Bede traveled to several abbeys and monasteries across the British Isles , even visiting the archbishop of York and King Ceolwulf of Northumbria . He is well known as an author , teacher ( a student of one of his pupils was Alcuin ) , and scholar , and his most famous work , Ecclesiastical History of the English People gained him the title \`\` The Father of English History '' . His ecumenical writings were extensive and included a number of Biblical commentaries and other theological works of exegetical erudition . Another important area of study for Bede was the academic discipline of computus , otherwise known to his contemporaries as the science of calculating calendar dates . One of the more important dates Bede tried to compute was Easter , an effort that was mired with controversy . He also helped establish the practice of dating forward from the birth of Christ ( Anno Domini -- in the year of our Lord ) , a practice which eventually became commonplace in medieval Europe . Bede was one of the greatest teachers and writers of the early Middle Ages and is considered by many historians to be the single most important scholar of antiquity for the period between the death of Pope Gregory I in 604 and the coronation of Charlemagne in 800 ."},{"query":"story of save the last dance for me","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Save the Last Dance for Me '' is the title of a popular song written by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman , first recorded in 1960 by The Drifters , with Ben E.

The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from 20 long years of political and economic action . These had the common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam . At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) . Eventually , U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States . Their main intent was to restrict the Communist domination that was present in the government of Vietnam as it would soon lead to a chain of neighbouring countries adopting the same . This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Southeast Asia . Essentially , the U.S. saw their major security interests being disturbed due to the rise of the communist expansion and strived to take any measure to end it .

A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary , a crustal extension , a spreading apart of the surface , which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion . When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart , a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks , forming a graben . The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new . That feature is the beginning of the rift valley , but as the process continues , the valley widens , until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area . One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift . On Earth , rifts can occur at all elevations , from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust . They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys , which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically ."},{"query":"why were the dutch eager to set up a colony in america","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Dutch colonization of the Americas began with the establishment of Dutch trading posts and plantations in the Americas , which preceded the much wider known colonisation activities of the Dutch in Asia .

They are tyrosine - based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism . T and T are partially composed of iodine . A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T and T , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre . The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T ) , which has a longer half - life than T. In humans , the ratio of T to T released into the blood is sometimes claimed to be quite high , but thyroid removal patient data suggests it to vary between 4 : 1 to 2 : 1 , the average being 100 : 36 ( roughly 2.8 : 1 ) . T is converted to the active T ( three to four times more potent than T ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5 ' - iodinase ) . These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T a ) and thyronamine ( T a ) .

The rate of this movement is a function of temperature , viscosity of the fluid and the size ( mass ) of the particles . Diffusion explains the net flux of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration . Once the concentrations are equal the molecules continue to move , but since there is no concentration gradient the process of molecular diffusion has ceased and is instead governed by the process of self - diffusion , originating from the random motion of the molecules . The result of diffusion is a gradual mixing of material such that the distribution of molecules is uniform . Since the molecules are still in motion , but an equilibrium has been established , the end result of molecular diffusion is called a \`\` dynamic equilibrium '' . In a phase with uniform temperature , absent external net forces acting on the particles , the diffusion process will eventually result in complete mixing ."},{"query":"rolling stones she makes a grown man cry","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"when did armenia became part of the soviet union","short_answer":"","abstract":"Armenia ( / ɑːr ˈmiːniə / ( listen ) , / - ˈmiːnjə / ; Armenian : Հայաստան , tr .

Management by objectives ( MBO ) , also known as management by results ( MBR ) , was first popularized by Peter Drucker in his 1954 book The Practice of Management . Management by objectives is the process of defining specific objectives within an organization that management can convey to organization members , then deciding on how to achieve each objective in sequence . This process allows managers to take work that needs to be done one step at a time to allow for a calm , yet productive work environment . This process also helps organization members to see their accomplishments as they achieve each objective , which reinforces a positive work environment and a sense of achievement . An important part of MBO is the measurement and comparison of an employee 's actual performance with the standards set . Ideally , when employees themselves have been involved with the goal - setting and choosing the course of action to be followed by them , they are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities . According to George S.

For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability . For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible , the energy release ( see below ) or Q value must be positive ."},{"query":"when was the last time australia had an earthquake","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a list of significant earthquakes recorded within Australia and its territories .

It is called reabsorption ( and not absorption ) both because these substances have already been absorbed once ( particularly in the intestines ) and because the body is reclaiming them from a post glomerular fluid stream that is well on its way to becoming urine ( that is , they will soon be lost to the urine unless they are reclaimed ) . Substances are reabsorbed from the tubule into the peritubular capillaries . This happens as a result of sodium transport from the lumen into the blood by the Na / K ATPase in the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells . Thus , the glomerular filtrate becomes more concentrated , which is one of the steps in forming urine . Reabsorption allows many useful solutes ( primarily glucose and amino acids ) , salts and water that have passed through Bowman 's capsule , to return to the circulation . These solutes are reabsorbed isotonically , in that the osmotic potential of the fluid leaving the proximal convoluted tubule is the same as that of the initial glomerular filtrate . However , glucose , amino acids , inorganic phosphate , and some other solutes are reabsorbed via secondary active transport through cotransport channels driven by the sodium gradient ."},{"query":"what does if a body catch a body comin thro the rye mean","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Comin ' Thro ' the Rye '' is a poem written in 1782 by Robert Burns ( 1759 -- 96 ) .

When the thickness of the film is an odd multiple of one quarter - wavelength of the light on it , the reflected waves from both surfaces interfere to cancel each other . Since the wave can not be reflected , it is completely transmitted instead . When the thickness is a multiple of a half - wavelength of the light , the two reflected waves reinforce each other , increasing the reflection and reducing the transmission . Thus when white light , which consists of a range of wavelengths , is incident on the film , certain wavelengths ( colors ) are intensified while others are attenuated . Thin - film interference explains the multiple colors seen in light reflected from soap bubbles and oil films on water . It is also the mechanism behind the action of antireflection coatings used on glasses and camera lenses ."},{"query":"who founded the royal academy of painting and sculpture in france","short_answer":"King Louis XIV","abstract":"The Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture ( Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture ) , Paris , was the premier art institution in France in the eighteenth century ."},{"query":"where did top gear build the bridge in thailand","short_answer":"over the Kok River","abstract":"The British motoring - themed television programme Top Gear is often the focus of criticism .

Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale , their speed , the types of forces that cause them , the regions in which they occur , and their effect . The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn . Winds have various aspects , an important one being its velocity ( wind speed ) ; another the density of the gas involved ; another its energy content or wind energy .

For both economic and political reasons , the U.S. government generally supported those who occupied the seats of power , whether they held that power legitimately or not . A clear exception was the French Intervention in Mexico , when the U.S. supported the beleaguered liberal government of Benito Juárez at the time of the American Civil War ( 1861 - 1865 ) . Prior to Woodrow Wilson 's inauguration on March 4 , 1913 , the U.S. Government focused on just warning the Mexican military that decisive action from the U.S. military would take place if lives and property of U.S. nationals living in the country were endangered . President William Howard Taft sent more troops to the US - Mexico border but did not allow them to intervene in the conflict , a move which Congress opposed . Twice during the Revolution , the U.S. sent troops into Mexico . la The U.S. recognized the government of Porfirio Díaz in 1878 , two years after Díaz 's coup d'état brought him to power . Díaz 's long rule of Mexico brought close economic cooperation between the two countries , especially since Díaz imposed political order that allowed business to flourish . In 1908 , however , Díaz gave an interview to a U.S. journalist , James Creelman , in which Díaz stated he would not run for re-election in 1910 ; the statement gave rise to politicking of potential candidates . Díaz reversed himself , ran for re-election , and jailed the leading opposition candidate , Francisco I. Madero . Mexican revolutionaries prior to the 1910 events had sought refuge on the U.S. side of the border , a pattern Madero continued . He escaped Mexico and took refuge in San Antonio , Texas and called for nullification of the 1910 elections , himself as provisional president , and revolutionary support from the Mexican people . His Plan of San Luis Potosí did spark revolutionary uprisings , particularly in Mexico 's north . The U.S. stayed out of the unfolding events until March 6 , 1911 , when President William Howard Taft mobilized forces on the U.S. - Mexico border . \`\` In effect this was an intervention in Mexican politics , and to Mexicans it meant the United States had condemned Díaz ."},{"query":"where is the pause key on a dell laptop","short_answer":"Ctrl + Fn + F11|Fn + B|Fn + Ctrl + B","abstract":"The Break key of a computer keyboard refers to breaking a telegraph circuit and originated with 19th century practice .
