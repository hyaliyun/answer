It was first discovered by Salvatore Luria and Mary Human in 1952 and 1953 . They found that bacteriophage growing within an infected bacterium could be modified , so that upon their release and re-infection of a related bacterium the bacteriophage 's growth is restricted ( inhibited ) ( also described by Luria in his autobiography on pages 45 and 99 in 1984 ) . In 1953 , Jean Weigle and Giuseppe Bertani reported similar examples of host - controlled modification using different bacteriophage systems . Later work by Daisy Roulland - Dussoix and Werner Arber in 1962 and many other subsequent workers led to the understanding that restriction was due to attack and breakdown of the modified bacteriophage 's DNA by specific enzymes of the recipient bacteria . As reviewed by Daniel Nathans and Hamilton O. Smith in 1975 , this work resulted in the discovery of the class of enzymes now known as restriction enzymes . When these enzymes were isolated in the laboratory they could be used for controlled manipulation of DNA , thus providing the foundation for the development of genetic engineering .

A power factor of less than one means that the voltage and current waveforms are not in phase , reducing the instantaneous product of the two waveforms ( V × I ) . Real power is the capacity of the circuit for performing work in a particular time . Apparent power is the product of the current and voltage of the circuit . Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source , or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source , the apparent power will be greater than the real power . A negative power factor occurs when the device ( which is normally the load ) generates power , which then flows back towards the source , which is normally considered the generator ."},{"query":"who has the best selling single of all time","short_answer":"Bing Crosby","abstract":"According to Guinness World Records , \`\` White Christmas '' ( 1942 ) by Bing Crosby is the best - selling single worldwide , with estimated sales of over 50 million copies .

The theory of trait leadership developed from early leadership research which focused primarily on finding a group of heritable attributes that differentiated leaders from nonleaders . Leader effectiveness refers to the amount of influence a leader has on individual or group performance , followers ' satisfaction , and overall effectiveness ( Derue , Nahrgang , Wellman , & Humphrey , 2011 ) . Many scholars have argued that leadership is unique to only a select number of individuals and that these individuals possess certain immutable traits that can not be developed ( Galton , 1869 ) . Although this perspective has been criticized immensely over the past century , scholars still continue to study the effects of personality traits on leader effectiveness . Research has demonstrated that successful leaders differ from other people and possess certain core personality traits that significantly contribute to their success . Understanding the importance of these core personality traits that predict leader effectiveness can help organizations with their leader selection , training , and development practices ( Derue et al. , 2011 ) ."},{"query":"who plays dr.elizabeth in the big bang theory","short_answer":"","abstract":"Judith Therese Evans ( born July 20 , 1975 ) , known as Judy Greer , is an American actress , model , and author .

Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell . The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane , are probably the most well known group of these local hormones ."},{"query":"when did the new season of ncis la start","short_answer":"September 26 , 2017","abstract":"NCIS is an American action police procedural television series , revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service , which investigates crimes involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps .

Most radar detectors are used so the driver can reduce the car 's speed before being ticketed for speeding . In general sense , only emitting technologies , like doppler RADAR , or LIDAR can be detected . Visual speed estimating techniques , like ANPR or VASCAR can not be detected in daytime , but technically vulnerable to detection at night , when IR spotlight is used . There are no reports that piezo sensors can be detected . LIDAR devices require an optical - band sensor , although many modern detectors include LIDAR sensors . Most of today 's radar detectors detect signals across a variety of wavelength bands : usually X , K , and K . In Europe the K band is common as well . The past success of radar detectors was based on the fact that radio - wave beam can not be narrow - enough , so the detector usually senses stray and scattered radiation , giving the driver time to slow down . Based on focused laser - beam , LIDAR technology is deprived of this shortcoming ; however requires precise aiming . Modern police radars incorporate formidable computing power , producing minimum of ultra-short pulses , reusing wide beam for multi-target measurement , which renders most detectors useless . But , mobile Internet allowed for GPS navigation devices mapping police radar spots in real - time . These gadgets are also often called \`\` radar detectors '' , while not necessary carrying an RF sensor ."},{"query":"what is the purpose of sinners in the hands of an angry god","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God '' is a sermon written by British Colonial Christian theologian Jonathan Edwards , preached to his own congregation in Northampton , Massachusetts to unknown effect , and again on July 8 , 1741 in Enfield , Connecticut .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .

They were primarily used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow - moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective . The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century . The killing capacity of gas was limited , with about ninety thousand fatalities from a total of some 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks . Gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop countermeasures , such as gas masks . In the later stages of the war , as the use of gas increased , its overall effectiveness diminished . The widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare , and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives , gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of World War I as \`\` the chemist 's war '' and also the era where \`\` weapons of mass destruction '' were created ."},{"query":"where does the name iron maiden come from","short_answer":"iron maiden torture device","abstract":"Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton , East London , in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris .

Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year ."},{"query":"how does jammu and kashmir enjoy a special status in india","short_answer":"","abstract":"Article 370 of the Indian constitution is an article that gives autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir .

The body produces insulin when glucose starts to be released into the bloodstream from the digestion of carbohydrates in the diet . Normally this insulin response triggers glucose being taken into body cells , to be used for energy , and inhibits the body from using fat for energy . The concentration of glucose in the blood decreases as a result , staying within the normal range even when a large amount of carbohydrates is consumed . When the body produces insulin under conditions of insulin resistance , the cells are resistant to the insulin and are unable to use it as effectively , leading to high blood sugar . Beta cells in the pancreas subsequently increase their production of insulin , further contributing to a high blood insulin level . This often remains undetected and can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults . Although this type of chronic insulin resistance is harmful , during acute illness it is actually a well - evolved protective mechanism . Recent investigations have revealed that insulin resistance helps to conserve the brain 's glucose supply by preventing muscles from taking up excessive glucose . In theory , insulin resistance should even be strengthened under harsh metabolic conditions such as pregnancy , during which the expanding fetal brain demands more glucose ."},{"query":"how many episodes are in gavin and stacey series 3","short_answer":"","abstract":"Gavin & Stacey is a British romantic situation comedy that follows the long - distance relationship of Gavin ( Mathew Horne ) from Billericay in Essex , England , and Stacy ( Joanna Page ) from Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan , Wales .
